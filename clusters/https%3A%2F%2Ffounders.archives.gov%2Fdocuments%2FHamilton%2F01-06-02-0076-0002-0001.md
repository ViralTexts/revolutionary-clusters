[To the Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
The Secretary of the Treasury, in obedience to the resolution of the House of Representatives, of the twenty-first day of September last, has, during the recess of Congress, applied himself to the consideration of a proper plan for the support of the Public Credit, with all the attention which was due to the authority of the House, and to the magnitude of the object.  
In the discharge of this duty, he has felt, in no small degree, the anxieties which naturally flow from a just estimate of the difficulty of the task, from a well-founded diffidence of his own qualifications for executing it with success, and from a deep and solemn conviction of the momentous nature of the truth contained in the resolution under which his investigations have been conducted, “That an adequate provision for the support of the Public Credit, is a matter of high importance to the honor and prosperity of the United States.”  
With an ardent desire that his well-meant endeavors may be conducive to the real advantage of the nation, and with the utmost deference to the superior judgment of the House, he now respectfully submits the result of his enquiries and reflections, to their indulgent construction.  
  
In the opinion of the Secretary, the wisdom of the House, in giving their explicit sanction to the proposition which has been stated, cannot but be applauded by all, who will seriously consider, and trace through their obvious consequences, these plain and undeniable truths.  
That exigencies are to be expected to occur, in the affairs of nations, in which there will be a necessity for borrowing.  
That loans in times of public danger, especially from foreign war, are found an indispensable resource, even to the wealthiest of them.  
And that in a country, which, like this, is possessed of little active wealth, or in other words, little monied capital, the necessity for that resource, must, in such emergencies, be proportionably urgent.  
And as on the one hand, the necessity for borrowing in particular emergencies cannot be doubted, so on the other, it is equally evident, that to be able to borrow upon good terms, it is essential that the credit of a nation should be well established.  
For when the credit of a country is in any degree questionable, it never fails to give an extravagant premium, in one shape or another, upon all the loans it has occasion to make. Nor does the evil end here; the same disadvantage must be sustained upon whatever is to be bought on terms of future payment.  
From this constant necessity of borrowing and buying dear, it is easy to conceive how immensely the expences of a nation, in a course of time, will be augmented by an unsound state of the public credit.  
To attempt to enumerate the complicated variety of mischiefs in the whole system of the social œconomy, which proceed from a neglect of the maxims that uphold public credit, and justify the solicitude manifested by the House on this point, would be an improper intrusion on their time and patience.  
In so strong a light nevertheless do they appear to the Secretary, that on their due observance at the present critical juncture, materially depends, in his judgment, the individual and aggregate prosperity of the citizens of the United States; their relief from the embarrassments they now experience; their character as a People; the cause of good government.  
If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly so important, the next enquiry which suggests itself is, by what means it is to be effected? The ready answer to which question is, by good faith, by a punctual performance of contracts. States, like individuals, who observe their engagements, are respected and trusted: while the reverse is the fate of those, who pursue an opposite conduct.  
Every breach of the public engagements, whether from choice or necessity, is in different degrees hurtful to public credit. When such a necessity does truly exist, the evils of it are only to be palliated by a scrupulous attention, on the part of the government, to carry the violation no farther than the necessity absolutely requires, and to manifest, if the nature of the case admits of it, a sincere disposition to make reparation, whenever circumstances shall permit. But with every possible mitigation, credit must suffer, and numerous mischiefs ensue. It is therefore highly important, when an appearance of necessity seems to press upon the public councils, that they should examine well its reality, and be perfectly assured, that there is no method of escaping from it, before they yield to its suggestions. For though it cannot safely be affirmed, that occasions have never existed, or may not exist, in which violations of the public faith, in this respect, are inevitable; yet there is great reason to believe, that they exist far less frequently than precedents indicate; and are oftenest either pretended through levity, or want of firmness, or supposed through want of knowledge. Expedients might often have been devised to effect, consistently with good faith, what has been done in contravention of it. Those who are most commonly creditors of a nation, are, generally speaking, enlightened men; and there are signal examples to warrant a conclusion, that when a candid and fair appeal is made to them, they will understand their true interest too well to refuse their concurrence in such modifications of their claims, as any real necessity may demand.  
  
While the observance of that good faith, which is the basis of public credit, is recommended by the strongest inducements of political expediency, it is enforced by considerations of still greater authority. There are arguments for it, which rest on the immutable principles of moral obligation. And in proportion as the mind is disposed to contemplate, in the order of Providence, an intimate connection between public virtue and public happiness, will be its repugnancy to a violation of those principles.  
This reflection derives additional strength from the nature of the debt of the United States. It was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and with solemnities, that give peculiar force to the obligation. There is indeed reason to regret that it has not hitherto been kept; that the necessities of the war, conspiring with inexperience in the subjects of finance, produced direct infractions; and that the subsequent period has been a continued scene of negative violation, or non-compliance. But a diminution of this regret arises from the reflection, that the last seven years have exhibited an earnest and uniform effort, on the part of the government of the union, to retrieve the national credit, by doing justice to the creditors of the nation; and that the embarrassments of a defective constitution, which defeated this laudable effort, have ceased.  
From this evidence of a favorable disposition, given by the former government, the institution of a new one, cloathed with powers competent to calling forth the resources of the community, has excited correspondent expectations. A general belief, accordingly, prevails, that the credit of the United States will quickly be established on the firm foundation of an effectual provision for the existing debt. The influence, which this has had at home, is witnessed by the rapid increase, that has taken place in the market value of the public securities. From January to November, they rose thirty-three and a third per cent, and from that period to this time, they have risen fifty per cent more. And the intelligence from abroad announces effects proportionably favourable to our national credit and consequence.  
It cannot but merit particular attention, that among ourselves the most enlightened friends of good government are those, whose expectations are the highest.  
To justify and preserve their confidence; to promote the encreasing respectability of the American name; to answer the calls of justice; to restore landed property to its due value; to furnish new resources both to agriculture and commerce; to cement more closely the union of the states; to add to their security against foreign attack; to establish public order on the basis of an upright and liberal policy. These are the great and invaluable ends to be secured, by a proper and adequate provision, at the present period, for the support of public credit.  
To this provision we are invited, not only by the general considerations, which have been noticed, but by others of a more particular nature. It will procure to every class of the community some important advantages, and remove some no less important disadvantages.  
The advantage to the public creditors from the increased value of that part of their property which constitutes the public debt, needs no explanation.  
But there is a consequence of this, less obvious, though not less true, in which every other citizen is interested. It is a well known fact, that in countries in which the national debt is properly funded, and an object of established confidence, it answers most of the purposes of money. Transfers of stock or public debt are there equivalent to payments in specie; or in other words, stock, in the principal transactions of business, passes current as specie. The same thing would, in all probability happen here, under the like circumstances.  
The benefits of this are various and obvious.  
First. Trade is extended by it; because there is a larger capital to carry it on, and the merchant can at the same time, afford to trade for smaller profits; as his stock, which, when unemployed, brings him in an interest from the government, serves him also as money, when he has a call for it in his commercial operations.  
Secondly. Agriculture and manufactures are also promoted by it: For the like reason, that more capital can be commanded to be employed in both; and because the merchant, whose enterprize in foreign trade, gives to them activity and extension, has greater means for enterprize.  
Thirdly. The interest of money will be lowered by it; for this is always in a ratio, to the quantity of money, and to the quickness of circulation. This circumstance will enable both the public and individuals to borrow on easier and cheaper terms.  
And from the combination of these effects, additional aids will be furnished to labour, to industry, and to arts of every kind.  
But these good effects of a public debt are only to be looked for, when, by being well funded, it has acquired an adequate and stable value. Till then, it has rather a contrary tendency. The fluctuation and insecurity incident to it in an unfunded state, render it a mere commodity, and a precarious one. As such, being only an object of occasional and particular speculation, all the money applied to it is so much diverted from the more useful channels of circulation, for which the thing itself affords no substitute: So that, in fact, one serious inconvenience of an unfunded debt is, that it contributes to the scarcity of money.  
This distinction which has been little if at all attended to, is of the greatest moment. It involves a question immediately interesting to every part of the community; which is no other than this—Whether the public debt, by a provision for it on true principles, shall be rendered a substitute for money; or whether, by being left as it is, or by being provided for in such a manner as will wound those principles, and destroy confidence, it shall be suffered to continue, as it is, a pernicious drain of our cash from the channels of productive industry.  
The effect, which the funding of the public debt, on right principles, would have upon landed property, is one of the circumstances attending such an arrangement, which has been least adverted to, though it deserves the most particular attention. The present depreciated state of that species of property is a serious calamity. The value of cultivated lands, in most of the states, has fallen since the revolution from 25 to 50 per cent. In those farthest south, the decrease is still more considerable. Indeed, if the representations, continually received from that quarter, may be credited, lands there will command no price, which may not be deemed an almost total sacrifice.  
This decrease, in the value of lands, ought, in a great measure, to be attributed to the scarcity of money. Consequently whatever produces an augmentation of the monied capital of the country, must have a proportional effect in raising that value. The beneficial tendency of a funded debt, in this respect, has been manifested by the most decisive experience in Great-Britain.  
The proprietors of lands would not only feel the benefit of this increase in the value of their property, and of a more prompt and better sale, when they had occasion to sell; but the necessity of selling would be, itself, greatly diminished. As the same cause would contribute to the facility of loans, there is reason to believe, that such of them as are indebted, would be able through that resource, to satisfy their more urgent creditors.  
It ought not however to be expected, that the advantages, described as likely to result from funding the public debt, would be instantaneous. It might require some time to bring the value of stock to its natural level, and to attach to it that fixed confidence, which is necessary to its quality as money. Yet the late rapid rise of the public securities encourages an expectation, that the progress of stock to the desireable point, will be much more expeditious than could have been foreseen. And as in the mean time it will be increasing in value, there is room to conclude, that it will, from the outset, answer many of the purposes in contemplation. Particularly it seems to be probable, that from creditors, who are not themselves necessitous, it will early meet with a ready reception in payment of debts, at its current price.  
Having now taken a concise view of the inducements to a proper provision for the public debt, the next enquiry which presents itself is, what ought to be the nature of such a provision? This requires some preliminary discussions.  
  
It is agreed on all hands, that that part of the debt which has been contracted abroad, and is denominated the foreign debt, ought to be provided for, according to the precise terms of the contracts relating to it. The discussions, which can arise, therefore, will have reference essentially to the domestic part of it, or to that which has been contracted at home. It is to be regretted, that there is not the same unanimity of sentiment on this part, as on the other.  
The Secretary has too much deference for the opinions of every part of the community, not to have observed one, which has, more than once, made its appearance in the public prints, and which is occasionally to be met with in conversation. It involves this question, whether a discrimination ought not to be made between original holders of the public securities, and present possessors, by purchase. Those who advocate a discrimination are for making a full provision for the securities of the former, at their nominal value; but contend, that the latter ought to receive no more than the cost to them, and the interest: And the idea is sometimes suggested of making good the difference to the primitive possessor.  
In favor of this scheme, it is alledged, that it would be unreasonable to pay twenty shillings in the pound, to one who had not given more for it than three or four. And it is added, that it would be hard to aggravate the misfortune of the first owner, who, probably through necessity, parted with his property at so great a loss, by obliging him to contribute to the profit of the person, who had speculated on his distresses.  
The Secretary, after the most mature reflection on the force of this argument, is induced to reject the doctrine it contains, as equally unjust and impolitic, as highly injurious, even to the original holders of public securities; as ruinous to public credit.  
It is inconsistent with justice, because in the first place, it is a breach of contract; in violation of the rights of a fair purchaser.  
The nature of the contract in its origin, is, that the public will pay the sum expressed in the security, to the first holder, or his assignee. The intent, in making the security assignable, is, that the proprietor may be able to make use of his property, by selling it for as much as it may be worth in the market, and that the buyer may be safe in the purchase.  
Every buyer therefore stands exactly in the place of the seller, has the same right with him to the identical sum expressed in the security, and having acquired that right, by fair purchase, and in conformity to the original agreement and intention of the government, his claim cannot be disputed, without manifest injustice.  
That he is to be considered as a fair purchaser, results from this: Whatever necessity the seller may have been under, was occasioned by the government, in not making a proper provision for its debts. The buyer had no agency in it, and therefore ought not to suffer. He is not even chargeable with having taken an undue advantage. He paid what the commodity was worth in the market, and took the risks of reimbursement upon himself. He of course gave a fair equivalent, and ought to reap the benefit of his hazard; a hazard which was far from inconsiderable, and which, perhaps, turned on little less than a revolution in government.  
That the case of those, who parted with their securities from necessity, is a hard one, cannot be denied. But whatever complaint of injury, or claim of redress, they may have, respects the government solely. They have not only nothing to object to the persons who relieved their necessities, by giving them the current price of their property, but they are even under an implied condition to contribute to the reimbursement of those persons. They knew, that by the terms of the contract with themselves, the public were bound to pay to those, to whom they should convey their title, the sums stipulated to be paid to them; and, that as citizens of the United States, they were to bear their proportion of the contribution for that purpose. This, by the act of assignment, they tacitly engage to do; and if they had an option, they could not, with integrity or good faith, refuse to do it, without the consent of those to whom they sold.  
But though many of the original holders sold from necessity, it does not follow, that this was the case with all of them. It may well be supposed, that some of them did it either through want of confidence in an eventual provision, or from the allurements of some profitable speculation. How shall these different classes be discriminated from each other? How shall it be ascertained, in any case, that the money, which the original holder obtained for his security, was not more beneficial to him, than if he had held it to the pressent time, to avail himself of the provision which shall be made? How shall it be known, whether if the purchaser had employed his money in some other way, he would not be in a better situation, than by having applied it in the purchase of securities, though he should now receive their full amount? And if neither of these things can be known, how shall it be determined whether a discrimination, independent of the breach of contract, would not do a real injury to purchasers; and if it included a compensation to the primitive proprietors, would not give them an advantage, to which they had no equitable pretension.  
It may well be imagined, also, that there are not wanting instances, in which individuals, urged by a present necessity, parted with the securities received by them from the public, and shortly after replaced them with others, as an indemnity for their first loss. Shall they be deprived of the indemnity which they have endeavoured to secure by so provident an arrangement?  
Questions of this sort, on a close inspection, multiply themselves without end, and demonstrate the injustice of a discrimination, even on the most subtile calculations of equity, abstracted from the obligation of contract.  
The difficulties too of regulating the details of a plan for that purpose, which would have even the semblance of equity, would be found immense. It may well be doubted whether they would not be insurmountable, and replete with such absurd, as well as inequitable consequences, as to disgust even the proposers of the measure.  
As a specimen of its capricious operation, it will be sufficient to notice the effect it would have upon two persons, who may be supposed two years ago to have purchased, each, securities at three shillings in the pound, and one of them to retain those bought by him, till the discrimination should take place; the other to have parted with those bought by him, within a month past, at nine shillings. The former, who had had most confidence in the government, would in this case only receive at the rate of three shillings and the interest; while the latter, who had had less confidence would receive for what cost him the same money at the rate of nine shillings, and his representative, standing in his place, would be entitled to a like rate.  
The impolicy of a discrimination results from two considerations; one, that it proceeds upon a principle destructive of that quality of the public debt, or the stock of the nation, which is essential to its capacity for answering the purposes of money—that is the security of transfer; the other, that as well on this account, as because it includes a breach of faith, it renders property in the funds less valuable; consequently induces lenders to demand a higher premium for what they lend, and produces every other inconvenience of a bad state of public credit.  
It will be perceived at first sight, that the transferable quality of stock is essential to its operation as money, and that this depends on the idea of complete security to the transferree, and a firm persuasion, that no distinction can in any circumstances be made between him and the original proprietor.  
The precedent of an invasion of this fundamental principle, would of course tend to deprive the community of an advantage, with which no temporary saving could bear the least comparison.  
And it will as readily be perceived, that the same cause would operate a diminution of the value of stock in the hands of the first, as well as of every other holder. The price, which any man, who should incline to purchase, would be willing to give for it, would be in a compound ratio to the immediate profit it afforded, and to the chance of the continuance of his profit. If there was supposed to be any hazard of the latter, the risk would be taken into the calculation, and either there would be no purchase at all, or it would be at a proportionably less price.  
  
For this diminution of the value of stock, every person, who should be about to lend to the government, would demand a compensation; and would add to the actual difference, between the nominal and the market value, and equivalent for the chance of greater decrease; which, in a precarious state of public credit, is always to be taken into the account.  
Every compensation of this sort, it is evident, would be an absolute loss to the government.  
In the preceding discussion of the impolicy of a discrimination, the injurious tendency of it to those, who continue to be the holders of the securities, they received from the government, has been explained. Nothing need be added, on this head, except that this is an additional and interesting light, in which the injustice of the measure may be seen. It would not only divest present proprietors by purchase, of the rights they had acquired under the sanction of public faith, but it would depreciate the property of the remaining original holders.  
It is equally unnecessary to add any thing to what has been already said to demonstrate the fatal influence, which the principle of discrimination would have on the public credit.  
But there is still a point in view in which it will appear perhaps even more exceptionable, than in either of the former. It would be repugnant to an express provision of the Constitution of the United States. This provision is, that “all debts contracted and engagements entered into before the adoption of that Constitution shall be as valid against the United States under it, as under the confederation.” which amounts to a constitutional ratification of the contracts respecting the debt, in the state in which they existed under the confederation. And resorting to that standard, there can be no doubt, that the rights of assignees and original holders, must be considered as equal.  
In exploding thus fully the principle of discrimination, the Secretary is happy in reflecting, that he is the only advocate of what has been already sanctioned by the formal and express authority of the government of the Union, in these emphatic terms—“The remaining class of creditors (say Congress in their circular address to the states, of the 26th of April 1783) is composed, partly of such of our fellow-citizens as originally lent to the public the use of their funds, or have since manifested most confidence in their country, by receiving transfers from the lenders; and partly of those, whose property has been either advanced or assumed for the public service. To discriminate the merits of these several descriptions of creditors, would be a task equally unnecessary and invidious. If the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favor of some than of others, the voice of policy, no less than of justice, pleads in favor of all. A wise nation will never permit those who relieve the wants of their country, or who rely most on its faith, its firmness, and its resources, when either of them is distrusted, to suffer by the event.”  
The Secretary concluding, that a discrimination, between the different classes of creditors of the United States, cannot with propriety be made, proceeds to examine whether a difference ought to be permitted to remain between them, and another description of public creditors—Those of the states individually.  
The Secretary, after mature reflection on this point, entertains a full conviction, that an assumption of the debts of the particular states by the union, and a like provision for them, as for those of the union, will be a measure of sound policy and substantial justice.  
It would, in the opinion of the Secretary, contribute, in an eminent degree, to an orderly, stable and satisfactory arrangement of the national finances.  
Admitting, as ought to be the case, that a provision must be made in some way or other, for the entire debt; it will follow, that no greater revenues will be required, whether that provision be made wholly by the United States, or partly by them, and partly by the states separately.  
The principal question then must be, whether such a provision cannot be more conveniently and effectually made, by one general plan issuing from one authority, than by different plans originating in different authorities.  
In the first case there can be no competition for resources; in the last, there must be such a competition. The consequences of this, without the greatest caution on both sides, might be interfering regulations, and thence collision and confusion. Particular branches of industry might also be oppressed by it. The most productive objects of revenue are not numerous. Either these must be wholly engrossed by one side, which might lessen the efficacy of the provisions by the other; or both must have recourse to the same objects in different modes, which might occasion an accumulation upon them, beyond what they could properly bear. If this should not happen, the caution requisite to avoiding it, would prevent the revenue’s deriving the full benefit of each object. The danger of interference and of excess would be apt to impose restraints very unfriendly to the complete command of those resources, which are the most convenient; and to compel the having recourse to others, less eligible in themselves, and less agreeable to the community.  
The difficulty of an effectual command of the public resources, in case of separate provisions for the debt, may be seen in another, and perhaps more striking light. It would naturally happen that different states, from local considerations, would in some instances have recourse to different objects, in others, to the same objects, in different degrees, for procuring the funds of which they stood in need. It is easy to conceive how this diversity would affect the aggregate revenue of the country. By the supposition, articles which yielded a full supply in some states, would yield nothing, or an insufficient product, in others. And hence the public revenue would not derive the full benefit of those articles, from state regulations. Neither could the deficiencies be made good by those of the union. It is a provision of the national constitution, that “all duties, imposts and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States.” And as the general government would be under a necessity from motives of policy, of paying regard to the duty, which may have been previously imposed upon any article, though but in a single state, it would be constrained, either to refrain wholly from any further imposition, upon such article, where it had been already rated as high as was proper, or to confine itself to the difference between the existing rate, and what the article would reasonably bear. Thus the pre-occupancy of an article by a single state, would tend to arrest or abridge the impositions of the union on that article. And as it is supposeable, that a great variety of articles might be placed in this situation, by dissimilar arrangements of the particular states, it is evident, that the aggregate revenue of the country would be likely to be very materially contracted by the plan of separate provisions.  
If all the public creditors receive their dues from one source, distributed with an equal hand, their interest will be the same. And having the same interests, they will unite in the support of the fiscal arrangements of the government: As these, too, can be made with more convenience, where there is no competition: These circumstances combined will insure to the revenue laws a more ready and more satisfactory execution.  
If on the contrary there are distinct provisions, there will be distinct interests, drawing different ways. That union and concert of views, among the creditors, which in every government is of great importance to their security, and to that of public credit, will not only not exist, but will be likely to give place to mutual jealousy and opposition. And from this cause, the operation of the systems which may be adopted, both by the particular states, and by the union, with relation to their respective debts, will be in danger of being counteracted.  
There are several reasons, which render it probable, that the situation of the state creditors would be worse, than that of the creditors of the union, if there be not a national assumption of the state debts. Of these it will be sufficient to mention two; one, that a principal branch of revenue is exclusively vested in the union; the other, that a state must always be checked in the imposition of taxes on articles of consumption, from the want of power to extend the same regulation to the other states, and from the tendency of partial duties to injure its industry and commerce. Should the state creditors stand upon a less eligible footing than the others, it is unnatural to expect they would see with pleasure a provision for them. The influence which their dissatisfaction might have, could not but operate injuriously, both for the creditors, and the credit, of the United States.  
Hence it is even the interest of the creditors of the union, that those of the individual states should be comprehended in a general provision. Any attempt to secure to the former either exclusive or peculiar advantages, would materially hazard their interests.  
Neither would it be just, that one class of the public creditors should be more favoured than the other. The objects for which both descriptions of the debt were contracted, are in the main the same. Indeed a great part of the particular debts of the States has arisen from assumptions by them on account of the union. And it is most equitable, that there should be the same measure of retribution for all.  
There is an objection, however, to an assumption of the state debts, which deserves particular notice. It may be supposed, that it would increase the difficulty of an equitable settlement between them and the United States.  
The principles of that settlement, whenever they shall be discussed, will require all the moderation and wisdom of the government. In the opinion of the Secretary, that discussion, till further lights are obtained, would be premature.  
All therefore which he would now think adviseable on the point in question, would be, that the amount of the debts assumed and provided for, should be charged to the respective states, to abide an eventual arrangement. This, the United States, as assignees to the creditors, would have an indisputable right to do.  
  
But as it might be a satisfaction to the House to have before them some plan for the liquidation of accounts between the union and its members, which, including the assumption of the state debts, would consist with equity: The Secretary will submit in this place such thoughts on the subject, as have occurred to his own mind, or been suggested to him, most compatible, in his judgment, with the end proposed.  
Let each state be charged with all the money advanced to it out of the treasury of the United States, liquidated according to the specie value, at the time of each advance, with interest at six per cent.  
Let it also be charged with the amount, in specie value, of all its securities which shall be assumed, with the interest upon them to the time, when interest shall become payable by the United States.  
Let it be credited for all monies paid and articles furnished to the United States, and for all other expenditures during the war, either towards general or particular defence, whether authorized or unauthorized by the United States; the whole liquidated to specie value, and bearing an interest of six per cent. from the several times at which the several payments, advances and expenditures accrued.  
And let all sums of continental money now in the treasuries of the respective states, which shall be paid into the treasury of the United States, be credited at specie value.  
Upon a statement of the accounts according to these principles, there can be little doubt, that balances would appear in favor of all the states, against the United States.  
To equalize the contributions of the states, let each be then charged with its proportion of the aggregate of those balances, according to some equitable ratio, to be devised for that purpose.  
If the contributions should be found disproportionate, the result of this adjustment would be, that some states would be creditors, some debtors to the union.  
Should this be the case, as it will be attended with less inconvenience for the United States, to have to pay balances to, than to receive them from the particular states, it may perhaps, be practicable to effect the former by a second process, in the nature of a transfer of the amount of the debts of debtor states, to the credit of creditor states, observing the ratio by which the first apportionment shall have been made. This, whilst it would destroy the balances due from the former, would increase those due to the latter. These to be provided for by the United States, at a reasonable interest, but not to be transferable.  
The expediency of this second process must depend on a knowledge of the result of the first. If the inequalities should be too great, the arrangement may be impracticable, without unduly increasing the debt of the United States. But it is not likely, that this would be the case. It is also to be remarked, that though this second process might not, upon the principle of apportionment, bring the thing to the point aimed at, yet it may approach so nearly to it, as to avoid essentially the embarrassment, of having considerable balances to collect from any of the states.  
The whole of this arrangment to be under the superintendence of commissioners, vested with equitable discretion, and final authority.  
The operation of the plan is exemplified in the schedule A.  
The general principle of it seems to be equitable, for it appears difficult to conceive a good reason, why the expences for the particular defence of a part in a common war, should not be a common charge, as well as those incurred professedly for the general defence. The defence of each part is that of the whole; and unless all the expenditures are brought into a common mass, the tendency must be, to add, to the calamities suffered, by being the most exposed to the ravages of war, an increase of burthens.  
This plan seems to be susceptible of no objection, which does not belong to every other, that proceeds on the idea of a final adjustment of accounts. The difficulty of settling a ratio, is common to all. This must, probably, either be sought for in the proportions of the requisitions, during the war, or in the decision of commissioners appointed with plenary power. The rule prescribed in the Constitution, with regard to representation and direct taxes, would evidently not be applicable to the situation of parties, during the period in question.  
The existing debt of the United States is excluded from the computation, as it ought to be, because it will be provided for out of a general fund.  
The only discussion of a preliminary kind, which remains, relates to the distinctions of the debt into principal and interest. It is well known, that the arrears of the latter bear a large proportion to the amount of the former. The immediate payment of these arrears is evidently impracticable, and a question arises, what ought to be done with them?  
There is good reason to conclude, that the impressions of many are more favorable to the claim of the principal than to that of the interest; at least so far, as to produce an opinion, that an inferior provision might suffice for the latter.  
But to the Secretary, this opinion does not appear to be well founded. His investigations of the subject, have led him to a conclusion, that the arrears of interest have pretensions, at least equal to the principal.  
The liquidated debt, traced to its origin, falls under two principal discriminations. One, relating to loans; the other to services performed and articles supplied.  
The part arising from loans, was at first made payable at fixed periods, which have long since elapsed, with an early option to lenders, either to receive back their money at the expiration of those periods, or to continue it at interest, ’till the whole amount of continental bills circulating should not exceed the sum in circulation at the time of each loan. This contingency, in the sense of the contract, never happened; and the presumption is, that the creditors preferred continuing their money indefinitely at interest, to receiving it in a depreciated and depreciating state.  
The other parts of it were chiefly for objects, which ought to have been paid for at the time, that is, when the services were performed or the supplies furnished; and were not accompanied with any contract for interest.  
But by different acts of government and administration, concurred in by the creditors, these parts of the debt have been converted into a capital, bearing an interest of six per cent. per annum, but without any definite period of redemption. A portion of the loan-office debt has been exchanged for new securities of that import. And the whole of it seems to have acquired that character, after the expiration of the periods prefixed for re-payment.  
If this view of the subject be a just one, the capital of the debt of the United States, may be considered in the light of an annuity at the rate of six per cent. per annum, redeemable at the pleasure of the government, by payment of the principal. For it seems to be a clear position, that when a public contracts a debt payable with interest, without any precise time being stipulated or understood for payment of the capital, that time is a matter of pure discretion with the government, which is at liberty to consult its own convenience respecting it, taking care to pay the interest with punctuality.  
Wherefore, as long as the United States should pay the interest of their debt, as it accrued, their creditors would have no right to demand the principal.  
But with regard to the arrears of interest, the case is different. These are now due, and those to whom they are due, have a right to claim immediate payment. To say, that it would be impracticable to comply, would not vary the nature of the right. Nor can this idea of impracticability be honorably carried further, than to justify the proposition of a new contract upon the basis of a commutation of that right for an equivalent. This equivalent too ought to be a real and fair one. And what other fair equivalent can be imagined for the detention of money, but a reasonable interest? Or what can be the standard of that interest, but the market rate, or the rate which the government pays in ordinary cases?  
From this view of the matter, which appears to be the accurate and true one, it will follow, that the arrears of interest are entitled to an equal provision with the principal of the debt.  
The result of the foregoing discussions is this—That there ought to be no discrimination between the original holders of the debt, and present possessors by purchase—That it is expedient, there should be an assumption of the state debts by the Union, and that the arrears of interest should be provided for on an equal footing with the principal.  
The next enquiry, in order, towards determining the nature of a proper provision, respects the quantum of the debt, and the present rates of interest.  
The debt of the union is distinguishable into foreign and domestic.

This includes all that has been paid in indents (except what has come into the treasury of the United States) which, in the opinion of the Secretary, can be considered in no other light, than as interest due.  
The unliquidated part of the domestic debt, which consists chiefly of the continental bills of credit, is not ascertained, but may be estimated at 2,000,000 dollars.  
These several sums constitute the whole of the debt of the United States, amounting together to 54,124,464 dollars, and 56 cents.  
That of the individual states is not equally well ascertained. The schedule E. shews the extent to which it has been ascertained by returns pursuant to the order of the House of the 21st September last; but this not comprehending all the states, the residue must be estimated from less authentic information. The Secretary, however, presumes, that the total amount may be safely stated at 25 millions of dollars, principal and interest. The present rate of interest of the state debts is in general, the same with that of the domestic debt of the union.  
On the supposition, that the arrears of interest ought to be provided for, on the same terms with the principal, the annual amount of the interest, which, at the existing rates, would be payable on the entire mass of the public debt, would be,

The interesting problem now occurs. Is it in the power of the United States, consistently with those prudential considerations, which ought not to be overlooked, to make a provision equal to the purpose of funding the whole debt, at the rates of interest which it now bears, in addition to the sum which will be necessary for the current service of the government?  
The Secretary will not say that such provision would exceed the abilities of the country; but he is clearly of opinion, that to make it, would require the extension of taxation to a degree, and to objects, which the true interest of the public creditors forbids. It is therefore to be hoped, and even to be expected, that they will chearfully concur in such modifications of their claims, on fair and equitable principles, as will facilitate to the government an arrangement substantial, durable and satisfactory to the community. The importance of the last characteristic will strike every discerning mind. No plan, however flattering in appearance, to which it did not belong, could be truly entitled to confidence.  
It will not be forgotten, that exigencies may, ere long, arise, which would call for resources greatly beyond what is now deemed sufficient for the current service; and that, should the faculties of the country be exhausted or even strained to provide for the public debt, there could be less reliance on the sacredness of the provision.  
  
But while the Secretary yields to the force of these considerations, he does not lose sight of those fundamental principles of good faith, which dictate, that every practicable exertion ought to be made, scrupulously to fulfil the engagements of the government; that no change in the rights of its creditors ought to be attempted without their voluntary consent; and that this consent ought to be voluntary in fact, as well as in name. Consequently, that every proposal of a change ought to be in the shape of an appeal to their reason and to their interest; not to their necessities. To this end it is requisite, that a fair equivalent should be offered for what may be asked to be given up, and unquestionable security for the remainder. Without this, an alteration, consistently with the credit and honor of the nation, would be impracticable.  
It remains to see, what can be proposed in conformity to these views.  
It has been remarked, that the capital of the debt of the union is to be viewed in the light of an annuity at the rate of six per cent. per annum, redeemable at the pleasure of the government, by payment of the principal. And it will not be required, that the arrears of interest should be considered in a more favourable light. The same character, in general, may be applied to the debts of the individual states.  
This view of the subject admits, that the United States would have it in their power to avail themselves of any fall in the market rate of interest, for reducing that of the debt.  
This property of the debt is favourable to the public; unfavourable to the creditor. And may facilitate an arrangement for the reduction of interest, upon the basis of a fair equivalent.  
Probabilities are always a rational ground of contract. The Secretary conceives, that there is good reason to believe, if effectual measures are taken to establish public credit, that the government rate of interest in the United States, will, in a very short time, fall at least as low as five per cent. and that in a period not exceeding twenty years, it will sink still lower, probably to four.  
There are two principal causes which will be likely to produce this effect; one, the low rate of interest in Europe; the other, the increase of the monied capital of the nation, by the funding of the public debt.  
From three to four per cent. is deemed good interest in several parts of Europe. Even less is deemed so, in some places. And it is on the decline; the increasing plenty of money continually tending to lower it. It is presumable, that no country will be able to borrow of foreigners upon better terms, than the United States, because none can, perhaps, afford so good security. Our situation exposes us less, than that of any other nation, to those casualties, which are the chief causes of expence; our incumbrances, in proportion to our real means, are less, though these cannot immediately be brought so readily into action, and our progress in resources from the early state of the country, and the immense tracts of unsettled territory, must necessarily exceed that of any other. The advantages of this situation have already engaged the attention of the European moneylenders, particularly among the Dutch. And as they become better understood, they will have the greater influence. Hence as large a proportion of the cash of Europe as may be wanted, will be, in a certain sense, in our market, for the use of government. And this will naturally have the effect of a reduction of the rate of interest, not indeed to the level of the places, which send their money to market, but to something much nearer to it, than our present rate.  
The influence which the funding of the debt is calculated to have, in lowering interest, has been already remarked and explained. It is hardly possible, that it should not be materially affected by such an increase of the monied capital of the nation, as would result from the proper funding of seventy millions of dollars. But the probability of a decrease in the rate of interest, acquires confirmation from facts, which existed prior to the revolution. It is well known, that in some of the states, money might with facility be borrowed, on good security, at five per cent. and, not unfrequently, even at less.  
  
The most enlightened of the public creditors will be most sensible of the justness of this view of the subject, and of the propriety of the use which will be made of it.  
The Secretary, in pursuance of it, will assume, as a probability, sufficiently great to be a ground of calculation, both on the part of the government and of its creditors—That the interest of money in the United States will, in five years, fall to five per cent. and, in twenty, to four. The probability, in the mind of the Secretary, is rather that the fall may be more rapid and more considerable; but he prefers a mean, as most likely to engage the assent of the creditors, and more equitable in itself; because it is predicated on probabilities, which may err on one side, as well as on the other.  
Premising these things, the Secretary submits to the House, the expediency of proposing a loan to the full amount of the debt, as well of the particular states, as of the union, upon the following terms.  
First—That for every hundred dollars subscribed, payable in the debt (as well interest as principal) the subscribed be entitled, at his option, either  
To have two thirds funded at an annuity, or yearly interest of six per cent, redeemable at the pleasure of the government, by payment of the principal; and to receive the other third in lands in the Western Territory, at the rate of twenty cents per acre. Or,  
To have the whole sum funded at an annuity or yearly interest of four per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding five dollars per annum on account both of principal and interest; and to receive, as a compensation for the reduction of interest, fifteen dollars and eighty cents, payable in lands, as in the preceding case. Or  
To have sixty-six dollars and two thirds of a dollar funded immediately at an annuity or yearly interest of six per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding four dollars and two thirds of a dollar per annum, on account both of principal and interest; and to have, at the end of ten years, twenty-six dollars and eighty-eight cents, funded at the like interest and rate of redemption. Or  
To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the contingency of living to a given age, not less distant than ten years, computing interest at four per cent. Or  
  
To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the contingency of the survivorship of the youngest of two persons, computing interest, in this case also, at four per cent.  
In addition to the foregoing loan, payable wholly in the debt, the Secretary would propose, that one should be opened for ten millions of dollars, on the following plan.  
That for every hundred dollars subscribed, payable one half in specie, and the other half in debt (as well principal as interest) the subscriber be entitled to an annuity or yearly interest of five per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding six dollars per annum, on account both of principal and interest.  
The principles and operation of these different plans may now require explanation.  
The first is simply a proposition for paying one third of the debt in land, and funding the other two thirds, at the existing rate of interest, and upon the same terms of redemption, to which it is at present subject.  
Here is no conjecture, no calculation of probabilities. The creditor is offered the advantage of making his interest principal, and he is asked to facilitate to the government an effectual provision for his demands, by accepting a third part of them in land, at a fair valuation.  
The general price, at which the western lands have been, heretofore, sold, has been a dollar per acre in public securities; but at the time the principal purchases were made, these securities were worth, in the market, less than three shillings in the pound. The nominal price, therefore, would not be the proper standard, under present circumstances, nor would the precise specie value then given, be a just rule. Because, as the payments were to be made by instalments, and the securities were, at the times of the purchases, extremely low, the probability of a moderate rise must be presumed to have been taken into the account. Twenty cents, therefore, seem to bear an equitable proportion to the two considerations of value at the time, and likelihood of increase.  
It will be understood, that upon this plan, the public retains the advantage of availing itself of any fall in the market rate of interest, for reducing that upon the debt, which is perfectly just, as no present sacrifice, either in the quantum of the principal, or in the rate of interest, is required from the creditor.  
The inductment to the measure is, the payment of one third of the debt in land.  
The second plan is grounded upon the supposition, that interest, in five years, will fall to five per cent. in fifteen more, to four. As the capital remains entire, but bearing an interest of four per cent. only, compensation is to be made to the creditor, for the interest of two per cent. per annum for five years, and of one per cent. per annum, for fifteen years, to commence at the distance of five years. The present value of these two sums or annuities, computed according to the terms of the supposition, is, by strict calculation, fifteen dollars and seven hundred and ninety-two thousandth parts of a dollar; a fraction less than the sum proposed.  
The inducement to the measure here is, the reduction of interest to a rate, more within the compass of a convenient provision; and the payment of the compensation in lands.  
The inducements to the individual are—the accommodation afforded to the public, the high probability of a complete equivalent—the chance even of gain, should the rate of interest fall, either more speedily or in a greater degree, than the calculation supposes. Should it fall to five per cent. sooner than five years; should it fall lower than five before the additional fifteen were expired; or should it fall below four, previous to the payment of the debt, there would be, in each case, an absolute profit to the creditor. As his capital will remain entire, the value of it will increase, with every decrease of the rate of interest.  
The third plan proceeds upon the like supposition of a successive fall in the rate of interest. And upon that supposition offers an equivalent to the creditor. One hundred dollars, bearing an interest of six per cent. for five years; of five per cent. for fifteen years, and thenceforth of four per cent. (these being the successive rates of interest in the market) is  
  
  
  equal to a capital of  
122 dollars, 510725 parts,  
  
  
  
bearing an interest of four per cent. which, converted into a capital, bearing a fixed rate of interest  
  
  
  of six per cent, is equal to  
81 dollars, 6738166 parts.  
  
  
  The difference between sixty-six dollars and two thirds of a dollar (the sum to be funded immediately) and this last sum is  
15 dollars, 0172 parts,  
  
  
which at six per cent per annum, amounts at the end of ten years, to  
26 dollars, 8755 parts,  
  
  
the sum to be funded at the expiration of that period.  
  
  
  It ought, however, to be acknowledged, that this calculation does not make allowance for the principle of redemption, which the plan itself includes; upon which principle the equivalent in a capital of six per cent. would be by strict calculation,  
87 dollars, 50766 parts.  
  
  
But there are two considerations which induce the Secretary to think, that the one proposed would operate more equitably than this: One is, that it may not be very early in the power of the United States to avail themselves of the right of redemption reserved in the plan: The other is, that with regard to the part to be funded at the end of ten years, the principal of redemption is suspended during that time, and the full interest at six per cent. goes on improving at the same rate; which for the last five years will exceed the market rate of interest, according to the supposition.  
The equivalent is regulated in this plan, by the circumstance of fixing the rate of interest higher, than it is supposed it will continue to be in the market; permitting only a gradual discharge of the debt, in an established proportion, and consequently preventing advantage being taken of any decrease of interest below the stipulated rate.  
Thus the true value of eighty-one dollars and sixty-seven cents, the capital proposed, considered as a perpetuity, and bearing six per cent. interest, when the market rate of interest was five per cent. would be a small fraction more than ninety-eight dollars, when it was four per cent. would be one hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifty-one cents. But the proposed capital being subject to gradual redemption, it is evident, that its value, in each case, would be somewhat less. Yet from this may be perceived, the manner in which a less capital at a fixed rate of interest, becomes an equivalent for a greater capital, at a rate liable to variation and diminution.  
It is presumable, that those creditors, who do not entertain a favorable opinion of property in western lands, will give a preference to this last mode of modelling the debt. The Secretary is sincere in affirming, that, in his opinion, it will be likely to prove, to the full as beneficial to the creditors, as a provision for his debt upon its present terms.  
It is not intended, in either case to oblige the government to redeem, in the proportion specified, but to secure to it, the right of doing so, to avoid the inconvenience of a perpetuity.  
The fourth and fifth plans abandon the supposition which is the basis of the two preceding ones, and offer only four per cent. throughout.  
The reason of this is, that the payment being deferred, there will be an accumulation of compound interest, in the intermediate period against the public, which, without a very provident administration, would turn to its detriment. And the suspension of the burthen would be too apt to beget a relaxation of efforts in the mean time. The measure therefore, its object being temporary accommodation, could only be adviseable upon a moderate rate of interest.  
With regard to individuals, the inducement will be sufficient at four per cent. There is no disposition of money, in private loans, making allowance for the usual delays and casualties, which would be equally beneficial as a future provision.  
A hundred dollars advanced upon the life of a person of eleven years old, would produce an annuity  
  
See Schedule F.

If commencing at fifty-one, of

The same sum advanced upon the chance of the survivorship of the youngest of two lives, one of the persons being twenty-five, the other, thirty years old, would produce, if the youngest of the two, should survive, an annuity  
  
Table Schedule G.  
  
for the remainder of life of  
23 dollars, 556 parts.  
From these instances may readily be discerned, the advantages, which these deferred annuities afford, for securing a comfortable provision for the evening of life, or for wives, who survive their husbands.  
The sixth plan also relinquishes the supposition, which is the foundation of the second, and third, and offers a higher rate of interest upon similar terms of redemption, for the consideration of the payment of one half of the loan in specie. This is a plan highly advantageous to the creditors, who may be able to make that payment; while the specie itself could be applied in purchases of the debt, upon terms, which would fully indemnify the public for the increased interest.  
It is not improbable, that foreign holders of the domestic debt, may embrace this as a desireable arrangement.  
As an auxiliary expedient, and by way of experiment, the Secretary would propose a loan upon the principles of a tontine.  
  
See Table Schedule H.

The annuities of those who die, to be equally divided among the survivors, until four-fifths shall be dead, when the principle of survivorship shall cease, and each annuitant thenceforth enjoy his dividend as a several annunity during the life, upon which it shall depend.  
These annuities are calculated upon the best life in each class, and at a rate of interest of four per cent. with some deductions in favor of the public. To the advantages which these circumstances present, the cessation of the right of survivorship on the death of four-fifths of the annuitants, will be no inconsiderable addition.  
The inducements to individuals are, a competent interest for their money from the outset, secured for life, and the prospect of continual encrease, and even of large profit to those, whose fortune it is, to survive their associates.  
It will have appeared, that in all the proposed loans, the Secretary has contemplated the putting the interest upon the same footing with the principal: That on the debt of the United States, he would have computed to the last of the present year: That on the debt of the particular states, to the last of the year 1791; the reason for which distinction will be seen hereafter.  
In order to keep up a due circulation of money, it will be expedient, that the interest of the debt should be paid quarter-yearly. This regulation will, at the same time, conduce to the advantage of the public creditors, giving them, in fact, by the anticipation of payment, a higher rate of interest; which may, with propriety, be taken into the estimate of the compensation to be made to them. Six per cent. per annum, paid in this mode, will truly be worth six dollars, and one hundred and thirty-five thousandth parts of a dollar, computing the market interest at the same rate.  
The Secretary thinks it advisable, to hold out various propositions, all of them compatible with the public interest, because it is, in his opinion, of the greatest consequence, that the debt should, with the consent of the creditors, be remoulded into such a shape, as will bring the expenditure of the nation to a level with its income. ’Till this shall be accomplished, the finances of the United States will never wear a proper countenance. Arrears of interest, continually accruing, will be as continual a monument, either of inability, or of ill faith; and will not cease to have an evil influence on public credit. In nothing are appearances of greater moment, than in whatever regards credit. Opinion is the soul of it, and this is affected by appearances, as well as realities. By offering an option to the creditors, between a number of plans, the change meditated will be more likely to be accomplished. Different tempers will be governed by different views of the subject.  
But while the Secretary would endeavour to effect a change in the form of the debt, by new loans, in order to render it more susceptible of an adequate provision; he would not think it proper to aim at procuring the concurrence of the creditors by operating upon their necessities.  
Hence whatever surplus of revenue might remain, after satisfying the interest of the new loans, and the demand for the current service, ought to be divided among those creditors, if any, who may not think fit to subscribe to them. But for this purpose, under the circumstance of depending propositions, a temporary appropriation will be most adviseable, and the sum must be limited to four per cent. as the revenues will only be calculated to produce, in that proportion, to the entire debt.  
The Secretary confides for the success of the propositions, to be made, on the goodness of the reasons upon which they rest; on the fairness of the equivalent to be offered in each case; on the discernment of the creditors of their true interest; and on their disposition to facilitate the arrangements of the government, and to render them satisfactory to the community.  
The remaining part of the task to be performed is, to take a view of the means of providing for the debt, according to the modification of it, which is proposed.  
On this point the Secretary premises, that, in his opinion, the funds to be established, ought, for the present, to be confined to the existing debt of the United States; as well, because a progressive augmentation of the revenue will be most convenient, as because the consent of the state creditors is necessary, to the assumption contemplated; and though the obtaining of that consent may be inferred with great assurance, from their obvious interest to give it; yet ’till it shall be obtained, an actual provision for the debt, would be premature. Taxes could not, with propriety, be laid for an object, which depended on such a contingency.  
All that ought now to be done, respecting it, is, to put the matter in an effectual train for a future provision. For which purpose, the Secretary will, in the course of this report, submit such propositions, as appear to him adviseable.  
The Secretary now proceeds to a consideration of the necessary funds.  
It has been stated that the debt of the United States consists of  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Dollars.  
Cents.  
  
  
The foreign debt, amounting, with arrears of interest, to  
11,710,378  
62  
  
  
And the domestic debt amounting, with like arrears, computed to the end of the year 1790, to  
42,414,085  
94  
  
  
Making together, Dollars  
54,124,464  
56  
  
  
The interest on the domestic debt is computed to the end of this year, because the details of carrying any plan into execution, will exhaust the year.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Dollars.  
Cents.  
  
  
The annual interest of the foreign debt has been stated at  
542,599  
66  
  
  
And the interest on the domestic debt at four percent. would amount to  
1,696,563  
43  
  
  
Making together, dollars,  
2,239,163  
09  
  
  
Thus to pay the interest of the foreign debt, and to pay four per cent on the whole of the domestic debt, principal and interest, forming a new capital,  
  
  
will require a yearly income of  
2,239,163 dollars, 9 cents.  
  
  
The sum which, in the opinion of the Secretary, ought now to be provided in addition to what the current service will require.  
For, though the rate of interest, proposed by the third plan, exceeds four per cent. on the whole debt, and the annuities on the tontine will also exceed four per cent. on the sums which may be subscribed; yet, as the actual provision for a part is, in the former case, suspended; as measures for reducing the debt, by purchases, may be advantageously pursued, and as the payment of the deferred annuities will of course be postponed, four per cent. on the whole, will be a sufficient provision.  
With regard to the instalments of the foreign debt, these, in the opinion of the Secretary, ought to be paid by new loans abroad. Could funds be conveniently spared, from other exigencies, for paying them, the United States could ill bear the drain of cash, at the present juncture, which the measure would be likely to occasion.  
But to the sum which has been stated for payment of the interest, must be added a provision for the current service. This the Secretary estimates at six hundred thousand dollars;  
  
See Schedule I.  
  
making, with the amount of the interest, two millions, eight hundred and thirty-nine thousand, one hundred and sixty-three dollars, and nine cents.  
This sum may, in the opinion of the Secretary, be obtained from the present duties on imports and tonnage, with the additions, which, without any possible disadvantage either to trade, or agriculture, may be made on wines, spirits, including those distilled within the United States, teas and coffee.  
The Secretary conceives, that it will be sound policy, to carry the duties upon articles of this kind, as high as will be consistent with the practicability of a safe collection. This will lessen the necessity, both of having recourse to direct taxation, and of accumulating duties where they would be more inconvenient to trade, and upon objects, which are more to be regarded as necessaries of life.  
That the articles which have been enumerated, will, better than most others, bear high duties, can hardly be a question. They are all of them, in reality—luxuries—the greatest part of them foreign luxuries; some of them, in the excess in which they are used, pernicious luxuries. And there is, perhaps, none of them, which is not consumed in so great abundance, as may, justly, denominate it, a source of national extravagance and impoverishment. The consumption of ardent spirits particularly, no doubt very much on account of their cheapness, is carried to an extreme, which is truly to be regretted, as well in regard to the health and the morals, as to the œconomy of the community.  
  
Should the increase of duties tend to a decrease of the consumption of those articles, the effect would be, in every respect desirable. The saving which it would occasion, would leave individuals more at their ease, and promote a more favourable balance of trade. As far as this decrease might be applicable to distilled spirits, it would encourage the substitution of cyder and malt liquors, benefit agriculture, and open a new and productive source of revenue.  
It is not however, probable, that this decrease would be in a degree, which would frustrate the expected benefit to the revenue from raising the duties. Experience has shewn, that luxuries of every kind, lay the strongest hold on the attachments of mankind, which, especially when confirmed by habit, are not easily alienated from them.  
The same fact affords a security to the merchant, that he is not likely to be prejudiced by considerable duties on such articles. They will usually command a proportional price. The chief things in this view to be attended to, are, that the terms of payment be so regulated, as not to require inconvenient advances, and that the mode of collection be secure.  
To other reasons, which plead for carrying the duties upon the articles which have been mentioned, to as great an extent as they will bear, may be added these; that they are of a nature, from their extensive consumption, to be very productive, and are amongst the most difficult objects of illicit introduction.  
Invited by so many motives to make the best use of the resource, which these articles afford, the essential enquiry is—in what mode can the duties upon them be most effectually collected?  
With regard to such of them, as will be brought from abroad, a duty on importation recommends itself by two leading considerations; one is, that meeting the object at its first entrance into the country, the collection is drawn to a point, and so far simplified; the other is, that it avoids the possibility of interference between the regulations of the United States, and those of the particular states.  
But a duty, the precautions for the collection of which should terminate with the landing of the goods, as is essentially the case in the existing system, could not, with safety, be carried to the extent, which is contemplated.  
  
In that system, the evasion of the duties, depends as it were, on a single risk. To land the goods in defiance of the vigilance of the officers of the customs, is almost, the sole difficulty. No future pursuit, is materially, to be apprehended. And where the inducement is equivalent to the risk, there will be found too many, who are willing to run it. Consequently there will be extensive frauds of the revenue, against which the utmost rigor of the penal laws, has proved, as often as it has been tried, an ineffectual guard.  
The only expedient which has been discovered, for conciliating high duties with a safe collection, is, the establishment of a second, or interior scrutiny.  
By pursuing the article, from its importation, into the hands of the dealers in it, the risk of detection is so greatly inhanced, that few, in comparison, will venture to incur it. Indeed every dealer, who is not himself the fraudulent importer, then becomes, in some sort, a centinel upon him.  
The introduction of a system, founded on this principle, in some shape or other, is, in the opinion of the Secretary, essential to the efficacy of every attempt, to render the revenues of the United States equal to their exigencies, their safety, their prosperity, their honor.  
Nor is it less essential to the interest of the honest and fair trader. It might even be added, that every individual citizen, besides his share in the general weal, has a particular interest in it. The practice of smuggling never fails to have one of two effects, and sometimes unites them both. Either the smuggler undersells the fair trader, as, by saving the duty, he can afford to do, and makes it a charge upon him; or he sells at the increased price occasioned by the duty, and defrauds every man, who buys of him, of his share of what the public ought to receive. For it is evident, that the loss falls ultimately upon the citizens, who must be charged with other taxes to make good the deficiency, and supply the wants of the state.  
The Secretary will not presume, that the plan, which he shall submit to the consideration of the house, is the best that could be devised. But it is the one, which has appeared to him freest from objections of any, that has occurred of equal efficacy. He acknowledges too, that it is susceptible of improvement, by other precautions in favor of the revenue, which he did not think it expedient to add. The chief outlines of the plan are not original, but it is no ill recommendation of it, that it has been tried with success.  
The Secretary accordingly proposes,  
That the duties heretofore laid upon wines, distilled spirits, teas and coffee, should, after the last day of May next, cease, and that instead of them, the following duties be laid.  
Upon every gallon of Madeira Wine, of the quality of London particular, thirty-five cents.  
Upon every gallon of other Madeira Wine, thirty cents.  
Upon every gallon of Sherry, twenty-five cents.  
Upon every gallon of other Wine, twenty cents.  
Upon every gallon of distilled Spirits, more than ten per cent. below proof, according to Dicas’s hydrometer, twenty cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits under five, and not more than ten per cent. below proof, according to the same hydrometer, twenty-one cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits of proof, and not more than five per cent. below proof, according to the same hydrometer, twenty-two cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits above proof, but not exceeding twenty per cent. according to the same hydrometer, twenty-five cents.  
Upon every gallon of those spirits more than twenty, and not more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the same hydrometer, thirty cents.  
Upon every gallon of those spirits more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the same hydrometer, forty cents.  
Upon every pound of Hyson Tea, forty cents.  
Upon every pound of other Green Tea, twenty-four cents.  
Upon every pound of Souchong and other black Teas, except Bohea, twenty cents.  
Upon every pound of Bohea Tea, twelve cents.  
Upon every pound of Coffee, five cents.  
  
That upon Spirits distilled within the United States, from Molasses, Sugar, or other foreign materials, there be paid—  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits, more than ten per cent below proof, according to Dicas’s hydrometer, eleven cents.  
Upon every gallon of those spirits under five, and not more than ten per cent. below proof, according to the same hydrometer, twelve cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits of proof, and not more than five per cent. below proof, according to the same hydrometer, thirteen cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits, above proof, but not exceeding twenty per cent. according to the same hydrometer, fifteen cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits, more than twenty, and not more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the same hydrometer, twenty cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the same hydrometer, thirty cents.  
That upon Spirits distilled within the United States, in any city, town or village, from materials of the growth or production of the United States, there be paid—  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits more than ten per cent. below proof, according to Dicas’s hydrometer, nine cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits under five, and not more than ten per cent. below proof, according to the same hydrometer, ten cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits of proof, and not more than five per cent. below proof, according to the same hydrometer, eleven cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits above proof, but not exceeding twenty per cent. according to the same hydrometer, thirteen cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits more than twenty, and not more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the same hydrometer, seventeen cents.  
Upon every gallon of those Spirits, more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the same hydrometer, twenty-five cents.  
That upon all Stills employed in distilling Spirits from materials of the growth or production of the United States, in any other place, than a city, town or village, there be paid the yearly sum of sixty cents, for every gallon, English wine measure, of the capacity of each Still, including its head.  
The Secretary does not distribute the duties on Teas into different classes, as has been done in the impost act of the last session; because this distribution depends on considerations of commercial policy, not of revenue. It is sufficient, therefore, for him to remark, that the rates, above specified, are proposed with reference to the lowest class.  
The Secretary conceiving, that he could not convey an accurate idea of the plan contemplated by him, for the collection of these duties, in any mode so effectual as by the draft of a bill for the purpose, begs leave respectfully to refer the House to that, which will be found annexed to this report, relatively to the article of distilled spirits; and which, for the better explanation of some of its parts, is accompanied with marginal remarks.  
It would be the intention of the Secretary, that the duty on wines should be collected upon precisely the same plan with that on imported spirits.  
But with regard to teas and coffee, the Secretary is inclined to think, that it will be expedient, till experience shall evince the propriety of going further, to exclude the ordinary right of the officers to visit and inspect the places in which those articles may be kept. The other precautions, without this, will afford, though not complete, considerable security.  
It will not escape the observation of the House, that the Secretary, in the plan submitted, has taken the most scrupulous care, that those citizens upon whom it is immediately to operate, be secured from every species of injury by the misconduct of the officers to be employed. There are not only strong guards against their being guilty of abuses of authority; they are not only punishable, criminally, for any they may commit, and made answerable in damages, to individuals, for whatever prejudice these may sustain by their acts or neglects: But even where seizures are made with probable cause, if there be an acquittal of the article seized, a compensation to the proprietors for the injury their property may suffer, and even for its detention, is to be made out of the public treasury.  
  
So solicitous indeed has the Secretary been, to obviate every appearance of hardship, that he has even included a compensation to the dealers, for their agency in aid of the revenue.  
With all these precautions to manifest a spirit of moderation and justice on the part of government: And when it is considered, that the object of the proposed system is the firm establishment of public credit; that on this depends the character, security and prosperity of the nation; that advantages in every light important, may be expected to result from it; that the immediate operation of it will be upon an enlightened class of citizens, zealously devoted to good government, and to a liberal and enlarged policy, and that it is peculiarly the interest of the virtuous part of them to co-operate in whatever will restrain the spirit of illicit traffic; there will be perceived to exist, the justest ground of confidence, that the plan, if eligible in itself, will experience the chearful and prompt acquiescence of the community.  
The Secretary computes the nett product of the duties proposed in this report at about one million seven hundred and three thousand four hundred dollars, according to the estimate in schedule K, which if near the truth, will, together with the probable product of the duties on imports and tonnage, complete the sum required. But it will readily occur, that in so unexplored a field there must be a considerable degree of uncertainty in the data. And that, on this account, it will be prudent to have an auxiliary resource for the first year, in which the interest will become payable, that there may be no possibility of disappointment to the public creditors, ere there may be an opportunity of providing for any deficiency, which the experiment may discover. This will accordingly be attended to.  
The proper appropriation of the funds provided, and to be provided, seems next to offer itself to consideration.  
On this head, the Secretary would propose, that the duties on distilled spirits, should be applied in the first instance, to the payment of the interest of the foreign debt.  
That reserving out of the residue of those duties an annual sum of six hundred thousand dollars, for the current service of the United States; the surplus, together with the product of the other duties, be applied to the payment of the interest on the new loan, by an appropriation, co-extensive with the duration of the debt.  
And that if any part of the debt should remain unsubscribed, the excess of the revenue be divided among the creditors of the unsubscribed part, by a temporary disposition; with a limitation, however, to four per cent.  
It will hardly have been unnoticed, that the Secretary had been thus far silent on the subject of the post-office. The reason is, that he has had in view the application of the revenue arising from that source, to the purposes of a sinking fund. The post-master-general gives it as his opinion, that the immediate product of it, upon a proper arrangement, would probably be, not less than one hundred thousand dollars. And from its nature, with good management, it must be a growing, and will be likely to become a considerable fund. The post-master-general is now engaged in preparing a plan,  
  
This plan, since the framing of this report, has been received, and will be, shortly, submitted.  
  
which will be the foundation of a proposition for a new arrangement of the establishment. This, and some other points relative to the subject referred to the Secretary, he begs leave to reserve for a future report.  
Persuaded as the Secretary is, that the proper funding of the present debt, will render it a national blessing: Yet he is so far from acceding to the position, in the latitude in which it is sometimes laid down, that “public debts are public benefits,” a position inviting to prodigality, and liable to dangerous abuse,—that he ardently wishes to see it incorporated, as a fundamental maxim, in the system of public credit of the United States, that the creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of extinguishment. This he regards as the true secret for rendering public credit immortal. And he presumes, that it is difficult to conceive a situation, in which there may not be an adherence to the maxim. At least he feels an unfeigned solicitude, that this may be attempted by the United States, and that they may commence their measures for the establishment of credit, with the observance of it.  
Under this impression, the Secretary proposes, that the nett product of the post-office, to a sum not exceeding one million of dollars, be vested in commissioners, to consist of the Vice-President of the United States or President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice, Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney-General of the United States, for the time being, in trust, to be applied, by them, or any three of them, to the discharge of the existing public debt, either by purchases of stock in the market, or by payments on account of the principal, as shall appear to them most adviseable, in conformity to the public engagements; to continue so vested, until the whole of the debt shall be discharged.  
As an additional expedient for effecting a reduction of the debt, and for other purposes which will be mentioned, the Secretary would further propose that the same commissioners be authorised, with the approbation of the President of the United States, to borrow, on their credit, a sum, not exceeding twelve millions of dollars, to be applied,  
First. To the payment of the interest and instalments of the foreign debt, to the end of the present year, which will require 3,491,923 dollars, and 46 cents.  
Secondly. To the payment of any deficiency which may happen in the product of the funds provided for paying the interest of the domestic debt.  
Thirdly. To the effecting a change in the form of such part of the foreign debt, as bears an interest of five per cent. It is conceived, that, for this purpose, a new loan, at a lower interest, may be combined with other expedients. The remainder of this part of the debt, after paying the instalments, which will accrue in the course of 1790, will be 3,888,888 dollars, and 81 cents.  
Fourthly. To the purchase of the public debt at the price it shall bear in the market, while it continues below its true value. This measure, which would be, in the opinion of the Secretary, highly dishonorable to the government, if it were to precede a provision for funding the debt, would become altogether unexceptionable, after that had been made. Its effect would be in favor of the public creditors, as it would tend to raise the value of stock. And all the difference, between its true value, and the actual price, would be so much clear gain to the public. The payment of foreign interest on the capital to be borrowed for this purpose, should that be a necessary consequence, would not, in the judgment of the Secretary, be a good objection to the measure. The saving by the operation would be itself, a sufficient indemnity; and the employment of that capital, in a country situated like this, would much more than compensate for it. Besides, if the government does not undertake this operation, the same inconvenience, which the objection in question supposes, would happen in another way, with a circumstance of aggravation. As long, at least, as the debt shall continue below its proper value, it will be an object of speculation to foreigners, who will not only receive the interest, upon what they purchase, and remit it abroad, as in the case of the loan, but will reap the additional profit of the difference in value. By the government’s entering into competition with them, it will not only reap a part of this profit itself, but will contract the extent, and lessen the extra profit of foreign purchases. That competition will accelerate the rise of stock; and whatever greater rate this obliges foreigners to pay, for what they purchase, is so much clear saving to the nation. In the opinion of the Secretary, and contrary to an idea which is not without patrons, it ought to be the policy of the government, to raise the value of stock to its true standard as fast as possible. When it arrives to that point, foreign speculations (which, till then, must be deemed pernicious, further than as they serve to bring it to that point) will become beneficial. Their money laid out in this country, upon our agriculture, commerce and manufactures, will produce much more to us, than the income they will receive from it.  
The Secretary contemplates the application of this money, through the medium of a national bank, for which, with the permission of the House, he will submit a plan in the course of the session.  
The Secretary now proceeds, in the last place, to offer to the consideration of the House, his ideas, of the steps, which ought at the present session, to be taken, towards the assumption of the state debts.  
These are briefly, that concurrent resolutions of the two Houses, with the approbation of the President, be entered into, declaring in substance,  
That the United States do assume, and will at the first session in the year 1791, provide, on the same terms with the present debt of the United States, for all such part of the debts of the respective states, or any of them, as shall, prior to the first day of January in the said year 1791, be subscribed towards a loan to the United States, upon the principles of either of the plans, which shall have been adopted by them, for obtaining a re-loan of their present debt.  
Provided that the provision to be made as aforesaid, shall be suspended, with respect to the debt, of any state, which may have exchanged the securities of the United States for others issued by itself, until the whole of the said securities shall, either be re-ex-changed, or surrendered to the United States.  
And provided also, that the interest upon the debt assumed, be computed to the end of the year 1791; and that the interest to be paid by the United States, commence on the first day of January, 1792.  
That the amount of the debt of each state so assumed and provided for, be charged to such state in account with the United States, upon the same principles, upon which it shall be lent to the United States.  
That subscriptions be opened for receiving loans of the said debts at the same times and places, and under the like regulations, as shall have been prescribed in relation to the debt of the United States.  
The Secretary has now completed the objects, which he proposed to himself, to comprise in the present report. He has, for the most part, omitted details, as well to avoid fatiguing the attention of the House, as because more time would have been desirable even to digest the general principles of the plan. If these should be found right, the particular modifications will readily suggest themselves in the progress of the work.  
The Secretary, in the views which have directed his pursuit of the subject, has been influenced, in the first place, by the consideration, that his duty from the very terms of the resolution of the House, obliged him to propose what appeared to him an adequate provision for the support of the public credit, adapted at the same time to the real circumstances of the United States; and in the next, by the reflection, that measures which will not bear the test of future unbiassed examination, can neither be productive of individual reputation, nor (which is of much greater consequence) public honor, or advantage.  
Deeply impressed, as the Secretary is, with a full and deliberate conviction, that the establishment of public credit, upon the basis of a satisfactory provision, for the public debt, is, under the present circumstances of this country, the true desideratum towards relief from individual and national embarrassments; that without it, these embarrassments will be likely to press still more severely upon the community—He cannot but indulge an anxious wish, that an effectual plan for that purpose may, during the present session, be the result of the united wisdom of the legislature.  
He is fully convinced, that it is of the greatest importance, that no further delay should attend the making of the requisite provision; not only, because it will give a better impression of the good faith of the country, and will bring earlier relief to the creditors; both which circumstances are of great moment to public credit: but, because the advantages to the community, from raising stock, as speedily as possible, to its natural value, will be incomparably greater, than any that can result from its continuance below that standard. No profit, which could be derived from purchases in the market, on account of the government, to any practicable extent, would be an equivalent for the loss, which would be sustained by the purchases of foreigners, at a low value. Not to repeat, that governmental purchases, to be honorable, ought to be preceded by a provision. Delay, by disseminating doubt, would sink the price of stock; and as the temptation to foreign speculations, from the lowness of the price, would be too great to be neglected, millions would probably be lost to the United States.  
All which is humbly submitted.  
Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury

©f the S E C TF. T A R Y of the TR E AS UR Y to the  
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES.  
  
Treasury Department, Jan. 9,1790.  
rT,HE Secretary ot the in obedience to the resolution  
c &#x27;he House of Representatives, of the twenty-firft day of  
. ept. lait, has, during the recess of Congress, applied himfelt to the  
eonfidcration of a proper plan for the fuppoit of the Public Cre­  
dit, with all the attention which was due to the authority of the  
House, and to the magnitude of the object.  
In the discharge of this duly, he has lelt, in no small degree, the  
anxieties which naturally flow from a just estimate of the difficulty  
of the talk, iroin a well-founded diffidence of his own qualifica­  
tions for executing it witli success, and from a deep and solemn  
conviction of the momentous nature of the truth contained in the  
resolution under which his investigations have been conducted,  
&quot; That an adequate provision for the support of the Public Credit,  
is a matter ot high importance to the honor and profperitv of the  
United States.&quot; &#x27;  
  
With an ardent dcfirc that his well-meant endeavors may be  
conducive to the real advantage of the nation, and with the utmost  
deference to the superior judgment of the House, he now refpefl­  
fully submits the refultof his enquiries and rcfleftions, to their in­  
dulgent conftru&amp;ion.  
  
In the opinion of ;he Secretary, the wisdom of the House, in  
giving their explicit fanftion to the proposition which has been  
stated, cannot but be applauded by all, who will.seriously consi­  
der, and trace through their obvious confequencej, these plain and  
undeniable truths.  
That exigencies are to be expected to occur, in the affairs of na­  
tions, in which there will be a nectflity for borrowing.  
That loans in times of public danger, efpccially from foreign  
war, are found an indispensable relource, even to the wealthiest of  
them.*—  
  
And that in a country, which, like this, is poflefled of little ac­  
tive wealth, or in other words, little m nied capital, the neceflity  
for that resource, mull, in such emergencies, be proportionably ur­  
gent.  
  
And as on the one hand, the neceflity for borrowing in particu­  
lar emergencies cannot be doubted, so on the other, it is equall)  
evident, that to be able to borrow upon good terms, it is eflentia  
that the credit of a nation ihould be well ellablifhed.  
  
For whert the credit of a country is in any degree questionable,  
it never fails to give an extravagant premium, in one (hape or ano­  
ther, upon all the loans it has occasion to make. Nor does the  
«vil end here ; the fame disadvantage mutt be futtained upon  
whatever is to be bought on terms of future payment.  
From this constant nectflily of borrowing and buying dear, it is  
tafy to conceive how immensely the expences of a nation, in a  
courfeof time, will be augmented by an unsound state of the pub­  
lic credit.  
  
To attempt to enumerate the complicated variety of mifchiefs  
in the whole system of the social economy, which proceed from a  
neglect of the maxims that uphold public credit, andjuftify the  
solicitude manifefted by the Houfc on this point, would be an im­  
proper intrusion on their time and patience.  
In so strong a light nevertheless do they appear to the Secretary,  
that on their due observance at the present critical juncture, mater­  
ially cfepends, in his judgment, the individual and aggregate pros­  
perity of the citizens of the United States j their relief from the  
embarraflments theynow experience ; their chara&amp;cr as a People ;  
the cause of good government.  
If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly so impor­  
tant, the next enquiry which suggests itfelf is, by what means it is  
to beefftfted ? The ready answer to which question is, by­  
good faith, by a punctual performance of contrails. States, like  
individuals, who observe their engagements, are refpeded and  
trusted ; while the reverse is the fate of those, who purlue an op­  
posite conduct.  
  
Every breach of the public engagements, whether from choice  
or neceflity, is in different degrees hurtful to public credit. When  
such a neceflity does truly exist, the evils of it arc poly to be pal­  
liated by a scrupulous attention, on the part of the government to  
carry the violation no farther thdn the neceflity absolutely requires,  
and to manifeftjif the nature of the cafe admits of it, a lincere dis­  
position tomake reparation, whenever circumstances lhall permit.  
But with every poflible mitigation, credit mutt fuffer, and numer­  
ous mifchiefs ensue. It is therefore highly important, when an  
appearance of neceflity fecms to press upon che public councils  
that they (hould examine well its reality, and be perfectly adurcd,  
that there is no method of efcapingfrom it, before they yidd to its  
fuggeflions. For though it cannot fjfely be affirmed, that occa­  
sions have never exiftcd, or may nut exist, in which violations of  
the.public faith, in this refpeff, are inevitable ; yet there is great  
reason to believe, that they exist far less frequently than precedents  
indicate ; and are olteneil either pretended through levity, or want  
offirmnefs, or supposed through wantof knowledge. Expedients  
might often have been devised to eifeft, confidently with good  
faith, what has been done in contravention of it. Those who are  
most commonly creditors of a nation, are, generally speaking, en­  
lightened men ; and theieare signal examples to warrant a conclu­  
lion, that when a candid and fair appeal is made to them, they  
■will understand their true interett too well to rcfule their concur­  
rence in such modifications of their claims, as any real neceflity  
maydemjnd.  
  
While the observance of that good faith, which is the basis of  
public credit, is recommended by the ftrongefl inducements of  
political expediency, it is enforced by conliderations of still great­  
er authority. There are arguments tor it, which reft on the im­  
mutable principles ot moral obligation. And in proportion as  
the mijid is diipofed to contemplate, in the order of Providence,  
an intimate connexion between public virtue and public happi­  
ness, will be its repugnancy to a violation of those principles.  
This rtflecli&#x27;in derives additional strength from the nature of  
the deVt of the United States. It was the price of liberty. The  
faith of America lias been repeatedly pledged for it, and with so­  
lemnities, .that give peculiar force to the obligation. There is in­  
deed reason to regret that it has not hitherto been kept; that the  
neeefiities of the war, conspiring with inexperience in the fubiefts  
of finance, produced dircft inftoftions ; and that the fubfequcnt  
period has been a continued scene of negative violation, or non­  
compliance. But 4 diminution of this regret arises from the re­  
flection, that the 1..fl seven } ears have exhibited an eai nest and uni­  
form effort, on the part of the government oftheunion, to retrieve  
the national credit, by doing jnftice to the creditors of the nation ;  
and thai the embarrassments of a defective constitution, which de­  
feated this laudable effort, have ceased.  
  
From this evidence of a favorable disposition, given by the for­  
mer government, the inflitution of a new one, cloathed with pow­  
ers competent to calliDg forththe resources of the community, has  
excited correspondent cxpeaations. A general belief, accord  
ingly, prevails, that the credit of the United States will quic&#x27;klv be  
eftabiifhed on the firm ioundation of an effe&amp;ual provision for the  
cxifting debt. The influence, which this has had at home, is wit­  
neflcd by the rapid increase, that has taken place in the market  
value of the public fecuritics. From January to November thev  
rofc thirty-three and a third per cent, and from that period to  
t.nstime they ha\e risen fifty per cent. more. And the intelli­  
gence from abroad announces effects proportiouablv favorabJe to  
our national credit and confcquence.  
It cannot but merit particular attention, that among ourfeives  
the molt enlightened friends of good government are thofc, whose  
expc&amp;ations are the highest.  
To juftify and preserve their confidence ; to promote the encrea­  
jing refpc&amp;ability of the American name ; to answer the calls of  
justice ; to restore landed property to its due value; to furnilh new  
refo irscs both to agriculture and commerce ; to cemcnt more  
  
REPORT  
  
closely the union of the States ; to add to their security againfl fo­  
reign attack ; to establish public order on the basis of an upright  
and liberal policy. Thele are the great and invaluable ends to be  
secured, by a proper and adequate provision, attheprcfent period,  
for the lupport of public credit.  
To this provision we are invited, not only by the general confe­  
derations, which have been noticed, but by others of a more par­  
ticular nature. It will procure to every class of the community  
lome important advantages, and remove some no less important  
disadvantages.  
  
1 he advantage to the public creditors from the increased value  
of that part of their property v&gt; hich constitutes the public debt,  
needs no explanation.  
But there is a confcquence of this, less obvious, though not 1 ess  
true, in which every other citizen isinterefted. It is a well known  
fa6l, that in countries in which the national debt is properly fund­  
ed, and an object of ellablifhed confidence, it answers molt of the  
purposes ot money. Transfers of stock or public debt are there  
equivalent to payments in specie; or in other words, stock in the  
principal tranfattions of bnfinefs, paiifes current as specie. The  
ame thing would in all probability happen here, under the like  
circumstances.  
  
The benefits of this are various and obvious.   
First. Trade is extended by it; be «. fe there is a larger capi­  
tal to carry it on, and the merchant can at the fame time, afford  
to trade for {mailer profits ; as his stock, which, when unemploy­  
ed, brings him in an interest from the government, serves him al­  
io as money, when he has a call for it in his commercial operations.  
Secondly. Agriculture andmanufaftures arealfo promoted by  
it : For the like reason, that more capital can be commanded to  
be employed in both ; and because the merchant, whose enter­  
prize in foreign trade, gives to them activity and extension, has  
greater means for encerprize.  
, Thirdly. The interest of money will be lowered by it ■ for  
&#x27; 1,,&#x27;i5,1? rwar 3 ,ratio&#x27; to &#x27;he quantity of money, and to the  
11 1 Circulation. This cireumftance will enable both the  
public a_nd individuals to borrow on easier and cheaper terms.  
And from the combination of these effects, additional aids will  
be turnilhed to labor, to industry, and to arts of every kind.  
But these good cffefls of a public debt are only to be looked

uttered to as it is, a pernicious drain of our ca(h from  
the channels of productive industry.  
The effefl, which the funding of the public debt on rirrht  
principles, would have upon landed property, is one of the clr  
cumflances attending such an arrangement, which has been least  
ad\ertcd to, though it deserves the mot particular attention The

of stock tons natural level, and ,o attach to it that fixed confi  
dence, which is necessary to its quality as money. Yet the late  
rapid rife ofthe public fecunties encourages an expefiauon that the  
progress of stock to the defireable point, will be much mnr.  
peditious than could have been forefeen. And as in the mrs&quot;  
time it will be encreafing in value, there is room !- TT  
that it will, from the outset, answer many of the ouroof« E&#x27;

it does not follow, that this was the cafe with all of them. It  
may well be supposed, that some of them did it either through  
want of confidence in an eventual provision, or from the allure­  
ments ot some profitable (peculation. How shall these different  
clafles be discriminated from each other ? How (hall it be ascer­  
tained, in any cafe, that the money, which the original holder  
obtained for his security, was not more beneficial to him, than if  
he had held it to the present time, to avail himfelf ot the provision  
which lhall be made? How shall it be known, whether it the  
purchaser had employed his money in some other way, he would  
not be in a better situation, than by having applied it in the pur­  
chase of fecuritics,though hefliould now receive their full amount ?  
And if neither of these things can be known, how lhall it be de­  
termined whether a discrimination, independent of the breach of  
ccntraft, would not do a real injury to purchasers ; and il it in­  
cluded a compensation to the primitive proprietors, would not  
give them an advantage,to which they had no equitable prctenfion.  
It may well be imagined, »lfo, that there are not wanting in­  
stances, in v.&#x27;I,ich individuals, urged by ajrefent neceflity, parted  
with the securities received by them from the public, and shortly  
after replaced them with others, as an indemnity for their firft  
loss. Shall they be deprived of the indemnity which they have  
endeavored to secure by so provident an arrangement ?   
Questions of this fort, on a close infpeftion, multiply them­  
selves without end, and demonstrate the iujufticeof adifcrimina­  
tion, even on the most subtle calculations ot equity) abftra&amp;ed  
from the obligation of contract.  
The difficulties too of regulating the details of a plan for that  
purpose, which would have even the femblanceof equity, would  
be found immense. It may well be doubted whether they would  
not be insurmountable, and replete with such absurd, as well as  
inequitable consequences, as to disgust even the proposers of the  
measure. .  
As a fpecimrn of its capricious operation, it will be fufficicnt  
So notice the effect it would have upon two petfons, who may be  
supposed two years ago to have purchased, each, securities at three  
lhillings in the pDund, and one of them to retain those boughtby  
him, till the discrimination should take place ; the other to have  
parted with those boughtby him, within a month pift, at nine  
shillings. The former, who had had most confidence in the go­  
vernment, would in this cafe only receive at the rate of three shil­  
lings and the interest ; while the latter, who had had less confi­  
dence would receive for what cos him the fame money at the rate of  
nine (hillings, and his representative, Jtanding in his place, would  
be entitled to a like rate.  
The impolicy of a discrimination results from two confidera­  
lions ; one, that it proceeds upon a principle deftruftive of that  
dunlih of the public debt, or the (lock of the nation, which is  
essential to its capacity for answering the purposes of money—that  
is thefecurity of transfer ; the other, that as well on this account,  
as because it includes a breach of faith, it renders property in the  
funds less valuable ; consequently induces lenders to demand a  
higher premium for what they lend, and produces every other in­  
convenience of a bad state of public credit.  
It will be perceived at firft fight, that the transferable quality  
of stock is essential to its operation as money, and that this de­  
pends on the idea of complete fccurity to the transferree, and a  
firm persuasion, that no diftinftion can in any circumstances be  
made between him and the original proprietor.  
The precedent of an invasion of this fundamental principle,  
would of courfetend to deprive the community of an advantage,  
with which no temporary saving could bear the lead comparison.  
And it will as readily be perceived, that the fame cause would  
Operate a diminution of the value of (lock in the hands of the firft,  
as well as every other holder. The price, which any man, who  
should incline to purchase, would be willing to give for it, would  
be in a compound ratio to the immediate profit it afforded, and  
to the chance of the continuance of his profit. If there was sup­  
posed to be any hazaid of the latter, the risk would be taken into  
the calculation, and either there would be no purchase at all, or  
it would be at a proportionably less price.  
For this dimiuution of the value of stock, every person, who  
should be about to lend to the government, would demand a com­  
pensation ; and would add to the ailual difference, between the  
nominal and the market value, an equivalent for the chance of  
greater decrease ; which, in a precarious state of public credit, is  
always to betaken into the account.  
Every compcnfation of this fort, it is evident, would be an  
absolute loss to the government.  
In the preceding discussion of the impolicy of adifcrimination,  
the injurious ten dcncy of it to those, who continue to be the hold­  
ers of the securities, they received from the government, has  
been explained. Nothing need be added, on this head, except  
that this is an additional and interesting light, in which the injus­  
tice of the measure may be seen. It would not only divest pre­  
(ent proprietors by purchase, of the rights they had acquired un­  
der the fanftion of public faith, but it would depreciate the pro­  
perty of the remaining original holders.  
It is equally unneceflary to add any thing to what has been al­  
ready said to demonstrate the fatal influence, which the principle  
of discrimination would have on the public credit.  
But there is still a point in view in which it will appear per­  
haps even more exceptionable, than in either of the former. It  
would be repugnant to an express provision of the constitution of  
the United States. This provision is, that &quot; all debts contrasted  
and engagements entered into before the adoption of that Consti­  
tution shall be as valid against the United Statcsunder it, as under  
the Confederation,&quot; which amounts to a constitutional ratifica­  
tion of the contrasts refpe&amp;ing the debt, in the state in which  
they existed under the confederation. And resorting to that stand­  
ard, there can be no doubt, that the rights of assignees and origi­  
nal holders, must be considered as equal.  
In exploding thus fully the principle of discrimination, the  
Secretary is happy in reflecting, that he is only the advocate of  
what has been already fanftioned by the formal and express au­  
thority of the government of the Union, in these emphatic terms—  
&quot; The remaining class of creditors (fay Congress in their circular  
addrefsto the States, ofthe 26thof April,l7B3) is compofcd, partly  
of such of our fellow citizens as originally lent to the public the use  
of their funds, or partly of those, whose property has been either  
advanced or afTumcd for the public fcrvice. To iifcrimmate the  
merits of these several descriptions of creditors, would be a talk  
equally unnecessary and inviduous. If the voice of humanity  
plead more loudly in favor of some than of others, the voice of  
policy, no less than of justice, pleads in favorof all. A wise  
nation will never permit those who relieve the wants of their  
country, or who rely mojl on its faith, itsfrmnefs, and its rcfources,  
when either of them is distrusted, to fufferby the event.&quot;  
The Secretary, concluding that a discrimination, between the  
different clafles of creditors of the United States, cannot with  
propriety be made, proceeds to examine whether a difference  
ou&quot;ht to be permitted to remain between them, and another de­  
fciiptionof public creditors—Those of the States individually.  
The Secretarv, after mature reflection on this point, entertains a  
full convifiion, that an alfumption of the debts of the particular  
States by the Union, and a like provision for them, as for those  
of the Union, will be a measure of found policy and substantial  
justice.  
It would, in the opinion of the Secretary, contribute, in ane­  
minent degree, to an orderly, ftabk and fitisia&amp;oiy arrangement  
of tie national finances  
  
[—336—]  
Admitting,3s ought to be the cafe,that a provision must Ibe rtad;  
in some way or other for the entire debt ;it will foillo ,  
greater revenues will be required, whether tha pro  
made wholly by the United States, or partly by them, and par  
ly by the States separately.  
The principal question then must be, whether fnch a provision  
cannot be more conveniently and effcftually made by one genera  
plan issuing from one authority, than by different plans ortgina  
tine in different authorities. .  
In the firft place there can be no competition for resources ;  
the lad, there must be such a competition. The consequences o  
this, without the greatest caution on both fides, might be inter­  
fering regulations, and thence collision and confufion. ™tlcula  
branches of industry might also be oppressed by it. Ihe mol  
productive obiefts of revenue are not numerous. Either then  
must be wholly engrossed by one fide, which might leflen the et­  
ficacy of the provisions by the other : or both must have recourh  
to the fame obiefts in different modes, which might occahon ar  
accumulation upon them, beyond what they could properl)  
bear. If this (hould not happen, the caution requisite to avoidinj  
it, would prevent the revenue&#x27;s deriving the full beneht ot eac  
obieft. The danger of interference and of excess wou.d be apt t&lt;  
impole restraints very unfriendly to the complete comman o  
those resources, which are the most convenient: and to compel th  
having recourse to others, less eligible in themselves, and Icls a  
greeable to the community.  
The difficulty of an effefiual command of the public relouices  
in cafe of separate provisions for the debt, may be seen in anothe  
and perhaps more striking light. It would naturally happen tla  
different States, from local considerations, would in some lnitancc:  
have recourse to different objects, in others, to the fame object*, 11  
different degrees, for procuring the funds of which they stood n  
need. It is easy to conceive how this diversity would afreet tni  
aggregate revenue of the country. By the supposition, article  
which yielded a full supply in some states, would yield nothing  
or an inefficient product, in others. And hence the public re  
venue would not derive the full benefit of those articles, &#x27;r°,n &#x27;&#x27;at&lt;  
regulations. Neither could the deficiencies be made good by tholi  
of the union. It is a provision of the national constitution, tha  
&quot; all duties, imposts and excises, (hall be uniform throughout tlv  
U.iited States.&quot; And as the general government would be undc  
a neceflity from motives of policy, of paying regard to the duty  
which may have been previously imposed upon any artic.e, thnug!  
but in a single state, it would be constrained, either to refiati  
wholly from any further imposition, upon such article, where i  
had been already rated as hibh as was proper, or to confine ltfel  
to the difference between the existing rate, and what the articli  
would reasonably bear. Thus the pre-occupancy oi an article b)  
i Tingle state, would tend to arrest or abridge the impositions ol  
the union on that article. And as it isfuppoteablc, that a great va­  
riety of articles might be placed in this situation, by diflimilar ar­  
rangements of the particular states, it is evident, that the aggregate  
revenue of the country would be likely to be very materially con­  
rafted by the plan of separate provisions.  
If all the public creditors receive their dues from one source  
liftributed with an equal hand, their interest will be the fame  
\nd having the fame intercfts, they -will unite in the support ol  
he fifcal arrangements of the government : As these, too, can b(  
nade with more convenience, where there is no competition •  
These circumstances combined will insure to the revenue laws i  
nore ready and more fatisfattory execution.  
It on the contrary there arc aiftintt provisions, there will be  
lillintt interests, drawing different ways. That union and con­  
crt of views, among the creditors, which in every government i;  
&gt;f great imporr.ance to their security, and to that of public credit,  
vill not only not exist, but will be likely to give place to mutual  
jealoufs and oppohtion And from this cause, the operation 01  
he systems which may be adopted, both by the particular States  
nd by the Union, with relation to their relpedlive debts, will be  
n danger of being counteracted.  
There are several reafont, which render it probable, that the fi­  
liation of the state creditors would be worle, than that ot the ere­  
litors of the Union, if there be not a national alTumption of the  
It ate debts. Of these it will be fuflicient to mention two ; one,  
hat a principal branch of revenue is exclusively veiled in the Uni­  
m ; the otiier, that a state must always be checked in the impofi  
ion of taxes on articles of consumption, froin the want of power  
o extend the fame regulation to the other States, and from the ten­  
lency of partial duties to injure its industry and commerce. Should  
lie state creditors stand upon a less &lt; ligiblefooting than the others,  
t is unnatural to expett they would lee with pleasure a provifior  
or them. The influence which their diflatisfa&amp;ion might have  
ould not but operate injuriously, both for the creditors, and the  
redit, of the United States.  
Hcnce it is even the interest of the creditors of the Union, thai  
hose &lt;&gt;l the individual States should be comprehended in a general  
&gt;rovifion. Any attempt to secure to the former either exclusive  
&gt;r peculiar advantages, would materially hazard their intercfts.  
Neither would it be iuft, that one class of the public creditors  
hould be more favored than the other. The objects for which  
&gt;oth descriptions of the debt were contratted, are in the main the  
a me. Indeed a great part of the particular debts ot the States has  
risen from aflfumptions by them on account of the Union. And  
t is most equitable, that there Ihould be the fame measure of re­  
ribution for all.  
There is an obje£lion, however, to an alTumption of the state  
lebts, which deserves particular notice. It may be supposed, that  
t would increase the difficulty of an equitable settlement between  
hem and the United States.  
The principles of that settlement, whenever they shall be dif­  
:u{fcd, will require all the moderation and wisdom of the govern­  
nent. In the opinion of the Secretary, that difcuflion, till further  
ights are obtained, would be premature.  
All therefore which he would now think advifeable on the  
&gt;oint in question, would be, that the amount of the debts assumed  
nd provided for, Ihould be charged to the refpc&amp;ive states, to  
bide an eventual arrangement. This, the United States, as aflign­  
s to the creditors, would have an indisputable right to do.  
But as it might be a fatisfa&amp;ion to the House to have before them  
ume plan for the liquidation of accounts between the union and  
ts members, which, including the alTumption of the state debts,  
vould consist with equity : The Secretary will lubmit in this place  
uch thoughts on the fubjeft, as have occured to his own mind, or  
teen suggested to him, most compatible, in his judgment, with  
he end proposed.  
Let each state be charged with all the money advanced to it out  
&gt;f thetreafury of the United States, liquidated according to the  
pecic value, at the time of e ch advance, with interest at fix per  
ent.  
  
Let it also be charged with the amount, in specie value, of all its  
securities which Qiall be a (Turned, with the interest upon them to  
the time, when interest (hall become payable by the United States.  
Let it be credited for all monies paid and articles furnilhed to  
the United States, and for all other expenditures during the war,  
either towards general or particular defence, whether authorized,  
or unauthorized by the United States ; the whole liquidated to  
Ipecie value, and bearing an interest of fix per cent, from the sever­  
al times at which the several payments, advances and expenditures  
  
accrued.  
And let all sums of continental money now in the treasuries of  
the refpe&amp;ive states, which shall be paid into the treasury of the  
United States, be credited at specie value.  
Upon a statement of the accounts according to these principles,  
there can be little doubt, that balances would appear in favor of  
all the States, against the United States,  
To equalize the contributions of the states, let each be then char­  
ged with its proportion of the aggregate of those balances, accord­  
ing to some equitable ratio, to be devised for that purpose.  
If the contributions (hould be found difproportionatevtke result  
  
of this sdjmlmtnt would be, that fame states would be creditor},  
some debtors to the union.  
Should this be the cafe, as it will be attended with lets incon.  
venience for the United States, to have to pay balances to, than to  
receive them from the particular states, it may perhaps, beprafti­  
cable to effect the form r by a second process, in the nature of a  
transfer of the amount of the debts of debtor states, to the credit of  
creditor states, observing the ratio by which the firft apportion­  
ment (hall have been made. This, whilst it would destroy the  
balances due from the former, would incrcafe those due to th­  
latter. These to be provided for by the United States, at a rea­  
sonable interest, but not to be transferable.  
The expediency of this fecoud process must depend on aknow.  
ledge of the result of the firft. If the inequalities should be too  
(treat, the arrangement may be impracticable, without unduly m­  
creafing the debt of the United States. But it is not likely, that  
this would be the cafe. It is also to be remarked, that though  
this fccond process might not, upon the principle of apportion­  
ment, bring the thing to the print aimed at, yet it may approach  
so nearly to it, as to avoid essentially the .mbarraflment, of hav­  
ing considerable balances to collect from any of the states.  
, The whole of this arrangement to be under the fupenntcndence  
of commissioners, vetted with equitable discretion, and &#x27;final ai&gt;

TH E general principle of it seems to be equitable, for it ap­  
pears diilkult to conceive a good reason, whj the expenccs  
for the particular defence of a part in a common war, should not  
be a common charge, as well as those incurred proleffedly for the  
general defence. The defence of each part is that ot the whole ;  
and unlefc all the expenditures are brought into a common mass,  
the tendency roust be, to add, to the calamities fullered, by be­  
ing the mofi exposed to the ravages of war, an increase of bur­  
thens.  
  
This plan seems to be susceptible of no objcftion, which does  
not belong to every other, that proceeds on the idea of a final ad­  
justment of accounts. The difficulty of fettling a ratio, is com­  
mon to all. This mull, probably, either be fought for in the pro-!  
portions of the requilitions, during the war. or in the decision of  
commissioners appointed with plenary power. The rule pre­  
scribed in the Constitution, with regard to representation and di­  
rest taxes, would evidently not be applicable to the situation of  
parties, during the period in question.  
The existing debt of the United States is excluded from the  
computation, as it ought to be, because it will be provided for  
out of a general fund.  
The only difcuflion of a preliminary kind, which remains, re­  
lates to the diftinftions of the debt into principal and interest. It  
is well known, that the arrears of the latter bfcar a large proportion  
to the amount of the former. The immediate pa) ment of these  
arrears is evidently jmprafticable, and a quelhon arifet, what  
ought to be done with them ?  
There is good reason to conclude, that the impressions of many  
are more favorable to the claim of the principal than to that of  
the interest ; at least so far, as to produce an opinion, that an infe­  
rior provision might fuifice for the latter.  
But to the Secretary, this opinion does not appear to be well  
founded. His investigations of the fubjtft, have led him to a con­  
clusion, that the arrears of interest have pretentions, at least equal  
to the principal.  
The liquidated debt, traced to its origin, falls under two prin­  
cipal discriminations. One, relating to loans ; the other to ser­  
vices performed and articles supplied.  
The part arising from loans, was at firft made payable at fixed  
periods, which have long since elapsed, with an early option to  
lenders, either to receive back their money at the expiration of  
those periods, Or to continue it at interest, &#x27;till the whole amount  
of continental bills circulating (hould not exceed the sum in cir­  
culation at the time of each loan. This contingency, in the sense  
of the contra£l, never happened ; and the presumption is, that  
the creditors preferred continuing their money indefinitely at in­  
terest, to receiving it in a depreciated and depreciating state.  
The other parts of it were chiefly for objrfts, which ought to  
have been paid for at the time, that is, when the services were  
performed or the fupplics furnilhed ; and were not accompanied  
&quot;with any contract for interest.  
But by different acts of government and adminiflration, con­  
curred in by the creditors, these parts of the debt have been con­  
verted into a capital, bearing an interest of fix per cent, per an­  
num, but without any definite period of redemption. A portion  
of the loan-office debt has been exchanged for new securities of  
thai import. And the whole of it seems to have acquired that  
character, after the expiration of the periods prefixed for repay­  
ment.  
  
If this view of the fubjcfl be a just one, the capital of the debt  
of the United States, may be considered in the light of an annuity  
at the i ate of fix per cent, per annum, redeemable at the pleasure  
of the government, by payment of the principal. For it leems to  
be acltar position, that when a public contrasts a debt payable  
with interest, without an/ precise time being ftipulatcd or under­  
stood for payment of the capital, that time is a matter of pure dis­  
cretion with the government, which is at liberty to confnlt its  
own convenience refpefting it, taking care to pay the interest with  
pun&amp;uality.  
Wherefore, as long as the United States should pay the interest  
of their debt, as it accrued, their creditors would have no right to  
demand the principal.  
But with regard to the arrears of interest, the cafe is differ­  
ent. These are now due, and those to whom they are due, have  
a right to claim immediate payment. To fay, that it would be  
impraflicable to comply, would not Vary the nature of the right.  
Nor can this idea of impracticability be honorably carried further,  
than to juftify the proportion of a new contrast upon the balis ot  
a commutation of that right for an equivalent. This equivalent  
too ought to be a real and fair one. And what other fair equiva­  
lent cm be imagined for the detention of money, but a reafdrtable  
interest? Or what can be the standard of that interest, but the  
  
market rate, or the rate which the government pays in ordinaly  
cafcs ?  
From this View ot the matter, which appears to be the accurate  
and true one, it will follow, that the arrears of interest are entitled  
to an equal provision with the principal of the debt.  
The result of the foregoing difcuflion? is this—That there ought  
to be no discrimination between the original holders ot the debt,  
and present possessors by purchase—That it is expedient, there  
(houldbe an aflumption oftheftate debts by theUnion,and that the  
arrears of interest Ihould be provided for on an equal tooting with  
the principal.  
The next enquiry, in order, towards determining the nature of  
a proper provision, refpefts the quantum of the debt, and the pre­  
sent rates of interest.  
  
The debt of the union is diftingmfhable into  
foreign and domestic.  
The foreign debt as stated in the schedule B.  
amounts to principal  
bearing an interest of four, and partly an in­  
terest of five per cent.  
Arrears of intercll to the fact oT December,  
1789,  
  
Making together, dbllar# 11,710,378 62  
The domtflrc debt may be tub-divided in­  
to liquidated arid unliquidated ; principal and  
interest.  
  
The principal df the liquidated part, as dated  
in the schedule C, amounts to  
bearing an interefl of fix per cent.  
The arrears of jntereft as stated in tiie schedule  
D. to the end of 1 amount to  
  
Making together, dollars 40,414,085 94  
This includes all that has been paid in indents (except what has  
come into the treasury oFthe United States) which, in the opinion  
of the Secretary, can be considered in no other light, than as inter­  
cft due.  
  
The unliquidated part of the domestic debt, which consists  
chiefly of the continental bills of credit, is not afcertaincd, but  
may he estimated at 2,000,000 dollars.  
  
These several sums conllitute the whole of the debt of the Uni­  
ted States, amounting together to 54,124,464 dollars, and 56  
cents.  
  
That of the individual dates is not equally well afcertaincd.  
Thefchedule E. shews the extent to which it has been ascertained  
by returns pursuant to the order of the House of the 2 ill Septem­  
ber last ; but this not comprehending all the Hates, the rcfidue  
must be cftimatcd from less authentic information. The Secre­  
  
tary, however, presumes, that the total amount may be faiely ftatco  
at 25 millions of dollars, principal and interest. The preient rate  
of intcreft of the state debts is in general, the fame with that of the  
domestic debt of the union.  
On the supposition, that the arrears of interest ought to be pro­  
vided for, on the fame terms with the principal, the annual amount  
of the interest, which, at the existing rates, would be payable on  
the entire mafsof the public debt, would be,

TH E intercfting problem now occurs. Is it in the power of  
the United States, confidently with those prudential consi­  
derations, which ought not to be overlooked, to make a provision  
equal to the purpose of funding the whole debt, at the rates of  
interest which it now bears, in addition to the sum which will be  
neceflary for the current service of the government ?  
The Secretary will not fay that such a provision would exceed  
the abilities of the country ; but he is clearly of opinion, that  
to make it, would require the extension of taxation to a degree,  
and to objc&amp;s, which the true interest of the public creditors for­  
bids. It is therefore to be hoped, and even to be expe&amp;ed, that  
they will chearfully concur in such modifications of their claims,  
on fair and equitable principles, as will facilitate to the govern­  
ment an arrangement substantial, durable and fatisfaflory to the  
community. The importance of the lafl chara&amp;eriftic will  
strike every discerning mind. No plan, however flattering in  
appearance, to which it did belong, could be truly entitled to  
confidence.  
  
It will not be forgotten, that exigencies may, ere long, arise,  
which would call for resources greatly beyond what is now deem­  
ed fufficient for the current service ; and that, fliould the faculties  
of the country be cxhaufted or evenJlrained to provide for the pub­  
lic debt, there could be less reliance on the facrednefs of the pro­  
vision.  
  
But while the Secretary yields to the force of these considera­  
tions, he does not lose fight of those fundamental principles of  
good faith, which di&amp;ates, that every pratticable exertion ought to  
be made, scrupulously to fulfil the engagements of the govern­  
ment ; that no change in the rights of its creditois ought to be  
attempted without their voluntary consent; and that this consent  
ought to be voluntary in fact as well as in name. Consequently,  
that every proposal of a change ought to be in the rtiape of an ap­  
peal to their rcafon and to their interest ; not to their necessities.  
To this end it is requisite, that a fair equivalent should be afforded  
for what may be asked to be given up, and unquestionable security  
for the remainder. Without this, an alteration, confidently with  
the credit and honor of the nation, would be impracticable.  
It remains to fee, what can be proposed in conformity to these  
  
views.  
  
It has been remarked, that the capital of the debt of the union  
is to be viewed in the light of an annuity at the rate of fix per cent,  
per annum, redeemable at the pleasure of the government, by  
payment of the principal. And it will not be required, that the  
arrears of interest (houKl be considered in a more favorable light.  
The fame chara&amp;er, in general, may be applied to the debts of  
the individual States.  
  
This view of the fubjett admits, that the United States would  
have it in their power to avail themselves of any fall in the market  
rate of interest, for reducing that of the debt.  
This property of the debt is favorable to the public ; unfavor­  
able to the creditor. And may facilitate an arrangement for the  
reduttion of interest, upon the bafisof a fair equivalent.  
Probabilities are always a rational ground of contrast. The  
Secretary conceives, that there is good reason to believe, if effettu­  
al measures are taken to cftablifh public credit, that the govern­  
ment rate of interest in the United States, will, in a very (hort  
time, fall at least as low as five per cent, and that in a period not  
exceeding twenty years, it will fink still lower, probably to four.  
There are two principal caufcs which will be likely to produce  
this effect ; one, the low rate of interest in Europe ; the other,  
the increase of the monied capital of the nation, by the funding of  
the public debt.  
From three to four per cent, is deemed good interest in fcvcral  
parts of Europe. Even less is deemed so, in some places. And  
it is on the decline ; the increasing plenty of money continually  
tending to lower it. It is presumable, that no country will be  
able to borrow of foreigners upon better terms, than the United  
States, because none can, perhaps, afford so good security. Our  
situation exposes us less, than that of any other nation, to those  
casualties, which are the chief causes of expcnce ; our incumber­  
ances, in proportion to our real means, are less, though these can­  
not immediately be brought so readilv into a&amp;ion and our pro­  
gress in resources from the early state of the country, and the im­  
mense tracts ot unsettled territory, must neceffanly exceed that of  
any other. The advantages of this fituat on have already engaged  
the attention of the European money-lenders, particularly among  
the Dutch. And as they become better understood, they will  
have the greater influence. Hence as large a proportion of the  
cafli of Europe as maybe wanted, will be, in a certain sense, in  
our market, for the use of governm. nt. And this will naturally  
have the effett of a reduction of the rate of interest, not indeed to  
the level of the places, which fend their money to market, but to  
fomt&#x27;hing much nearer to it, than our present rate.  
The influence, which the funding of the debt is calculated to  
have, in lowering interest, has been already remarked and ex­  
plained. It is hardly poflible, that it should not be materially  
affe&amp;ed by such an increase of the monied capital of the nation, as  
would result from the proper funding of seventy millions of dol­  
lars. But the probability of a decieafe in the rate of interest, ac­  
quires confirmation from fa£b, which existed prior to the revo­  
lution. It is well known, that in some of the states, money might  
with facility be borrowed, on good security, at five per cent, and,  
not unfrequently, even at less.  
The most enlightened of the public creditors will be most sen­  
sible of the justness of this view of thefubjeft, and of the proprie­  
ty of the use which will be made of it.  
  
The Secretary, in pursuance of it, will assume, as a probability,  
iufficiently great to be a giound of calculation, both on the part  
of the government and of its creditors—That the interest of mo­  
ney in the United States will, in five years, fall to five per cent,  
and, in twenty, to four. The probability, in the mind of the Se­  
cretary, is rather that the fall may be more rapid and more con­  
siderable ; but he prefers a mean, as most likely to engage the as­  
sent of the creditors, and more equitable in itlelf; because it is  
predicated on probabilities, which may err on one fide, as well as  
on the other.  
  
Premising these things, the Sencretary submits to the House, the  
expediency of promifmg a loan to the full amount of the debt,  
as well of the particular states, as of the union, upon* the follow­  
ing terms.  
First— That for every hundred dollars fubferibed, payable in  
the debt (as well interest as principal) the fubferiber be entitled, at  
his option, either  
To have two thirds funded at an annuity, or yearly interest  
of fix percent, redeemable at the plealure of the government, by  
payment of the principal ; and to receive the other third in lands  
in the Western Territory, at the rate of twenty cents per acre.  
Or,  
  
To have the whole sum funded at an annuity or yearly interest  
of four per cent, irredeemable by any payment exceeding five  
dollars per annum on account both of principal and interest ; and  
to receive, as a compensation for the reduction of interest, fifteen  
dollars and eighty cents, payable in lands, as in the preceding  
cafe. Or  
  
To have sixty-six dollars and two thirds of a dollar funded im­  
mediately at an annuityor yearly interest of fix percent, irredeem­  
able by any payment exceeding four dollars and two thirds of a  
dollar per annum, on account both of principal and interest •  
and to have, at the end of ten years, twenty-fix dollars and eighty­  
eight cents, funded at the like interest and rate of redemption  
Or  
  
To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the con­  
tingency of living to a given age, not lefsdiftant than ten years,  
computing intcreft at four per cent. Or  
To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the con­  
tingency of the furvivorfhipot the youngest of two persons, com­  
puting interest, in this cafe also, at foui per cent.

©f the SECRETARY of the TR E AS U R Y to the  
  
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES.  
  
Treasury Department, Jan. 9, 1790.  
[continuation.]  
IN addition to the foregoing loan* payable wholly in the  
debt, the Secretary -would propose, that one should be opened  
ior ten millions of dollars, on the following plan.  
That for every hundred dollars fubferibed, payable one half in  
specie, and the other half in debt (as well principal as interest) the  
fubferiber be entitled to an annuity or yearly interest of live per  
cent, irredeemable by any payment exceeding fix dollars per an­  
num, on account both of principal and interest.  
The principles and operation of theie different plans may now  
require explanation.  
  
The hilt is simply a proposition for paying one third of the  
debt in land, and funding the other two thirds, at the existing rate  
of interest, and upon the fame terms of redemption, to which it is  
at present fubjett.  
Here is no conje&amp;ure, no calculation of probabilities. The  
creditor is offered the advantage of making his interest principal,  
and he is asked to facilitate to the government an etfeftual provi­  
sion for his demands, by accepting a third part of them in land,  
at a fair valuation.  
  
Ihe general price, at which the woftern lands have been, here­  
tofore, fold, has been a dollar per acre in public securities; but  
at the time the principal purchafcs were made, these securities  
were worth, in the market, lefa than three (hillings in the pound.  
The nominal price, therefore, would not be the proper standard,  
under present circumstances, nor would the precise specie value  
then given, be a just rule. Bccaufe, as the payments were to be  
made by instalments, and the securities were, at the times of the  
purchases, extremely low, the probability of a moderate rife must  
be presumed to have been taken into the account. Twenty cents,  
therefore, seem to bear an equitable proportion to the two con­  
siderations of value at the time, and likelihood of incrcafe.  
  
It will be understood, that upon this plan, the public retains  
the advantage of availing irfelf oi any fall in the market rate of in­  
terest, f r reducing that upon the debt, which is perfe&amp;ly just, as  
no present facrifice, either in the quantum of the principal, or in  
the rate of interest, is required from the creditor.  
The inducement to the measure is, the payment of one third of  
the debt in land.  
  
The second plan is grounded upon the supposition, that interest,  
in five years, will fall to five per cent, in fifteen more, to four:  
As the capital remains entire, but bearing an interest of four per  
cent, only, compensation is to be made to the creditor, for the in­  
terest of two per cent, per annum for five years, and of one per  
cent, per annum, for fifteen years, to commence at the distance of  
five years. The present value of these two sums or annuities, com­  
puted according to the terms of the supposition, is, by ftrift calcu­  
lation, fifteen dollars and seven hundred and ninety-two thou­  
sandth parts of a dollar ; a fradlion less than the sum proposed.  
The inducement to the measure here is, the redufclion of interest  
to a rate, more within the compass of a convenient provision ; and  
the payment of the compensation in lands.  
The inducements to the individual are—the accommodation af­  
forded to the public—the high probability of acomplcteequivalent ;  
the chance even of gain, should the rate of interest fall, either more  
speedily or in a greater degree, than the calculation luppofes.  
Should it fall to five per cent, sooner than five years; Ihoulu it fall  
lower than five before the additional fifteen were expired ; or  
should it tall below four, previous to the payment of the debt,  
there would be, in each cafe, an absolute profit to the creditor.  
As his capital will remain entire, the value of it will increase, with  
every dccreafe of the rate of interest.  
The third plan proceeds upon the like fuppofiiion of a fuccef­  
fivefall in the rate of interest. And upon that supposition offers  
an equivalent to thecreditor. One hundred dollars, bearing an  
interest of fix per cent, for five years; of five per cent, for fifteen  
years, and thenceforth of four per cent, (these being the succes­  
sive rates of interest in the market) is  
equal to a capital of - - 122 dollars, 510725 parts,  
&#x27;earing an interest of four per cent, which, converted into a  
capital, bearing a fixed rate of interest of fix per cent, is equal  
vo 81 dollars, 6738166 parts.  
  
The difference between (ixty-fix dollars and two thirds of a  
dollar (the sum to be funded immediately) and this last sum  
  
is - - 15 dollars, 0172 parts,  
which at fix per cent, per annum, amounts at the end of ten  
  
years, to 26 dollars, 8755 parts,  
the sum to be funded at the expiration of that period.  
  
It ought, however, to be acknowledged, that this calculation  
does not make allowance for the principle of redemption, which  
the plan itlelf includes ; upon which principle the equivalent in  
a capital of fix per cent, would be by ftri&amp; calculation,  
  
But there arc two considerations which induce the Secretray to  
think, that the one proposed would operate more equitably than  
this : One is, that it may not be very early in the power of the  
United States to avail themselves of the right of redemption re­  
lerved in the plan : The other is, that with regard to the part to  
be funded at the end of ten years, the principle of redemption is  
suspended during that time, andthefull interest at fix per cent,  
goes 011 improving at the Jamc rate ; which for the UJI Jive years will  
exceed the market rate of interest, according to the supposition.  
The equivalent is regulated in this plan, by the circumstance of  
fixing the rate of interest higher, than it is supposed it will con­  
tinue to be in the market; permitting only a gradual discharge of  
the debt, in an eftablilhed proportion, and consequently pievent­  
ing advantage being taken of any decrease of interest below the  
stipulated rate.  
  
Thus the true value of eighty-one dollars and sixty-seven cents,  
the capital proposed, considered as a perpetuity, and&#x27;bearing fix  
per cent, interest, when the market rate of interest was five percent,  
would be a small fraction more than ninety-eight dollars, when  
it was four per cent, would be one hundred and twenty-two dol­  
lars and fifty-one cents. But the proposed capital being fubjett to  
gradual redemption, it is evident, that its value, in each cafe, would  
be fomewhnt less. Yet from this may be perceived, the manner  
in which a less capital at a fixed rate of interest, becomes an equiv­  
alent for a greater capital, at a rate liable to variation and dimi-  
  
nution,  
  
It is prcfumable, that those creditors, who do not entertain a  
favorable opinion of property in western lands, will give a pre­  
ference to tins iaft mode of modelling the debt. The Secretary  
:s sincere in affirming, that, in his opinion, it will be likely to  
prove, to the full as beneficial to the creditors, as a provision for  
his debt upon its present terms.  
  
It is not intended, in either cafe to oblige the government to  
redeem, in the proportion fpecified, but to secure to it, the right of  
doing so, to avoid the inconvenience of a perpetuity.  
The fourth and fifth plans abandon the fuppofitioa which is the  
bafisof the two preceding ones, and offer only four per cent,  
throughout.  
  
The reaion of this is, that the payment being deferred, there  
will be an accumulation of compound intereft,in the intermediate  
period against the public, which, -without a very provident ad­  
ininiltratHjn, would turn to its detriment. And the suspension of  
the burthen would be too apt to beget a relaxation of efforts in the  
meantime. The measure therefore, its objett being temporary  
ccomrnodation, could only be advifeable on a moderata rate of  
  
interest.  
  
With regard to individuals, the inducement will be fufficicnt at  
four per cent. There is no disposition of money, in private loans,  
making allowance lor the usual delays and carualties, wh e!\ would  
be equally beneficial as a future proviiion.

The fame sum advanced upon the chance of the furvivoilhip of  
the youngtft of two lives, one of the persons being twenty-five,  
the other, thirty years old, would produce, if the youngest of the  
two, should survive, an annuity for the remainder of lite of  
23 dollars, 556 parts.  
  
From these instances may readily bed.fcerncd, the advantages,  
which these deterred annuities atford, for securing a comfortable  
providon for the evening of life, or for wives, who survive their  
hulbands.  
  
The sixth plan also relinquishes the supposition, which is the  
foundation of the second, and third, and offers a higher rate of  
interest upon similar terms of redemption, for the coniideration of  
the payment of one half of the loan in specie. This is a plan  
highly advantageous to the creditors, who may be able to make  
that payment; while the specie itfelf could be applied in pur­  
chases of the debt, upon terms, which would fully indemnify the  
public tor the increased interest. 4  
  
It is not improbable, that foreign holders of the domtflic debt,  
may embrace this as a desirable arrangement.  
As an auxiliary expedient, and by W3y of experiment, the Se­  
cretary would pro pole a loan upon the principles ot a tontine.  
To consist of fix claffcs, composed refpe&amp;ively of persons of the  
following ages :  
  
First class, of those of 2© years and under.  
Second class, of those above 20, and not exceeding 30.  
Third class, of those above 30, and not exceeding 40.  
Fourth class, of those above 40, and not exceeding 50.  
Fifth class, of those above 50, and not exceeding 60.  
  
Sixth class, of ihofe above 60.  
  
Each (hare to be two hundred dollars. The number of shares  
in each class, to be indefin&#x27;te. Persons to be at liberty to fub­  
icribe on their own lives, or on those of others, nominated by  
them. Dollars. Cents.  
  
The annuity upon a (hare in the firft class to be  
upon a (hare in the fctond  
upon a ihar. in the third  
upon a share in the fourth  
upon a share in the fifth

The annuities of those who die, to be equally divided   
survivors, until four-fifths shall be dead, when the principle of  
furvivotlhip (hall cease, and each annuitant thenceforth enjoy his  
dividend as a fcvcral annuity di» the life, upon which it shall  
depend.  
Thcfe annuities are calculated on the best life in each class, and  
at a rate of intereil of four per cent, with fomc dedu&amp;ions in fa­  
vor of the public. To the advantages which thcfe cncumftances  
present, the celTation of the right of survivorship on the death of  
iour-fifths of the annuitants, will be no inconsiderable addition.  
  
The inducements to individuals are, a competent interefl for  
their money from the outset, secured for life, and the profpeft of  
continual encreafc, and even of large profit to those, whose fortune  
it is, to survive their associates.  
  
It will have appeared, that in all the proposed loans, the Se­  
cretary has contemplated the putting the intercft upon the fame  
footing with the principal : 7hut on the debt ot the United States,  
he would have computed to the last of the pre Cent year : That on  
the debt of the particular States, to the last of the year 1791 ; the  
reason for whicn diftinttion will be leen hereafter.  
  
In order to keep up a due circulation of money, it will be ex­  
pedient, that the intercftof the dabt Ihould be paid quarter-year­  
ly. This regulation will, at the fame time, conduce to the advan­  
tage of the public creditors, giving them, in fatt, by the antici­  
pation of payment, a higher rate of intcreft; which may, with  
propriety, be taken into the estimate of the compcnfation to be  
made to them. Six per cent, per annum, paid in this mode, will  
truly be worth fix dollars, and one hundred and thirty-five thou­  
sandth parts of a dollar, computing the market interell at the fame  
rate.

TH E Secretary thinks it advifeable, to hold out various pro­  
portions, all of them compatible with the public interell,  
because it is, in his opinion, of the greatest consequence, that the  
debt should, with the consent of the creditors, be remoulded into  
fnch a shape, as will bring the expenditure of the nation to a le­  
vel with its income. Till this ihall be accomplished, the finances  
of the United States will never wear a proper countenance. Ar­  
rears of interest, continually accruing, will be as a continual mo­  
nument, either of inability, or of ill faith ; and will not cease to  
have an evil influence on public credit. In nothing are appear­  
ances of greater moment, than in whatever regards credit. Opin­  
ion is the foul of it, and this is affected by appearances, as well  
as realities. By offering an option to the creditors,bet ween a num­  
ber of plans, the change meditated will be more likely to be ac­  
complished. Different tempers will be governed by different  
views of the fubjeft.  
But while the Secretary would endeavor to effett a change in  
the form of the debt, by new loans, in order to render it more  
susceptible of an adequate provision ; he would not think it pro­  
per to aim at procuring the concurrence of the creditors by ope­  
rating upon their neceflities.  
Hence whatever surplus of revenue might remain, after fatiafy­  
ing the intereft&#x27;of the new loans, and the demand for the current  
service, ought to be divided among those creditors, if any, who  
nav not think fit to fubferibe to them. But for this purpose,  
under the circumstance of depending proportions, a temporary  
appropriation will be mofl advifeable, and the sum mufl be limit­  
ed to four per cent, as the revenues will only be calculated to pro­  
duce, in that proportion, to the entire debt.  
The Secretary confides for the success of the proportions, to be  
made, on the goodness of the reasons upon which they reft ; on  
the fairnefs of the equivalent to be offered in each cafe ; on the  
discernment of the creditors of their true interest ; and on their  
disposition to facilitate the arrangements of the government, and  
to render them fatisfa£lory to the community.  
The remaining part of the talk to be performed is, to take a  
view of the means of providing foe the debt, according to the mo­  
dification of it, which is proposed.  
On this point the Secretary premises, that, in his opinion, the  
funds to be cftabliftied, ought, for the present, to be coufincd to  
the cxifting debt of the United States ; as well, because a progref­  
live augmentation of the revenue will be moll convenient, as be­  
cause the consent of the State creditors is necessary, to the assump­  
tion contemplated ; and though the obtaining of that consent may  
be inferred with great alTurance, from their obvious interest to  
give it ; yet till it shall be obtained, an atkual provision for the  
debt, would be premature. Taxes could not, with propriety, be  
laid for an object, which depended on such a contingency. ,  
All that ought now to be done, refpe&amp;ing it, is, to put the mat­  
ter in an effectual train for a future provision. For which pur­  
pose, the Secretary will, in the course of this report, submit such  
propositions, as appear to him advifeable.  
The Secretary now proceeds to a consideration of the necclTary  
funds.  
  
It has been Hated that the debt of the United States consists of  
Dollars. Cents.  
  
The foreign debt, amounting, with ar­  
rears of interest, to - 11,710.378 62  
Ana the domestic debt amounting, with  
Jike arrears, computing to the end of  
the year 1790, to  
  
Making together, Dollars 54,124.464 56  
The interefl on the domestic debt is computed to the end of  
fhis year, because the details of carrying any plan into execution,  
will exhaust the year. &#x27; Dollar J. dents.  
The annual interest of the foreign debt has  
been Stated at  
  
And the interefl on the domcftic debt at four  
per cent, would amount to  
  
Making together, dollars, 2,239,163 09  
Thus to pay the interest of the foreign debt, and to pay four  
per cent, on the whole of the domcftic debt, principal and inter­  
est, forming a new capital,  
will require a yearly income of 2,239,163 dollars, 9 cents.  
The sum which, in the opinion of the Secretary, ought now to  
be provided in addition to what the current service will require.  
For, though the rate of interest, proposed by the third plan, ex­  
ceeds four per cent, on the whole debt, and the annuities on the  
tontine will a]fo excecd four per cent, on the sums which may be  
fubferibed ; yet, as the a£lual provision for a part is, in the for­  
mer caff, suspended ; as mcafures for reducing the debt, by pur­  
chases, may be advantageoiifly purfucd, and as the payment of the  
deferred annuities will of courie be postponed, four per cent, on  
the whole, will be a fufficicnt provision.  
  
With regard to the nftalments of the foreign debt, these, iu the  
©pinion of the Secretary, ought to be paid by new loans abroad.  
Could funds be conveniently spared, from other exigencies, for  
paying them, the United States could ill bear the drain of cash,  
at the present jun&amp;ure, which the mcafure would be likely to oc­  
casion.  
  
But to the sum which has been dated for payment of the intcreft,  
must be added a provision for the current iervwee. This the Se­  
cretary eltimates at fix hundred thousand dollars ; making, with  
the amount of the intcreft, two millions, eight hundred and thir­  
ty-nine thousand, one hundred and sixty-three dollars, and nine  
  
cents.  
  
This sum may, in the opinion of the Secretary, he obtained from  
the pre fen t duties on imports and tonnage, with the additions,  
which, without any ptfflible difodvantage either to trade,oj agricul­  
ture, may be made on wines, spirits. including those diftillcd  
within the United States, teas and coffee.  
  
The Secretary conceives, that it will be found policy, to earrv  
the duties upon articles of this kind, as high as will be confident  
with the pra&amp;icability of a fafe collection. This will lessen the  
nrceflity, both of having rccourfe to dircft taxation, and of ac­  
cumulating duties where they would be more inconvenient to  
trade, and upon objc&amp;s, which are more to be regarded as ne­  
cellaries of life.  
  
That the articles which have been enumerated, will, better than  
mod others, bear high duties, can hardly be a question. They  
are all of them, in reality—luxuries—the greatest part of them fo­  
reign luxuries ; some of them, in the excess in which they are  
used, pernicious luxuries. And there is, perhaps, none of them,  
which is not consumed in so great abundance, as may, justly, de­  
nominate it, afource of national extravagance and impoveriflimenr  
The consumption of ardent spirits particularly, no doubt very  
much on account of their cheapness, is carried to an extreme,  
which is truly to be regretted, as well in regard to the health and  
the morals, as to the economy of the community.  
Should the increafeof duties tend to a decrease of the consump­  
tion of those articles, the effect would be, in every refpeft desirable.  
The saving which it would occasion, would leave individuals more  
at their ease, and promote a more favorable balance of trade. As  
frr as this decrease might be applicableto distilled spirits, it would  
encourage the substitution of cyder and malt liquors, benefit agri­  
culture, and open a new and productive source o! revenue.  
  
It is not however, probable, that this decrease would be in a  
degree, which would fruflrate the expected benefit to the revenue  
from raising the duties. Experience has shewn, that luxuries of  
every kind, lay the strongest hold on the attachments of mankind,  
which, especially when confirmed by habit, are not easily alienat­  
ed from them.

[continuation FROM N&#x27;O. 89.]  
THE fame fail affords a fertility to the merchant, that he is  
not likely to be prejudiced by rontiderable duties oil such ar­  
ticles. They will usually command a proportional price. The  
chief things in this view to be attended to, aie, that the terms of  
pavmeiu be so regulated, as not to require inconvenient advances,  
and that the mode of colletHon&#x27;be secure.  
  
Toother reasons, which plead for carrying the duties upon the  
articles which have been mentioned, to as great an extent as they  
will bear, may be added these ; that they are of a nature, from  
their txtenfive consumption, to be very produ&amp;ive, and arc a­  
mongst the mod difficult objects, of illicit introdu6lion.  
Invited by so many motives to make the belt use of the re­  
fourcc, which these articles afford, the tflVntial enquiry is—in  
what mode can the duties upon them be mod efte£fcually collid­  
ed ?  
  
With regard to such of them, as will be brought from abroad, a  
duty on importation recommends itfclf by two leading considera­  
tions ; one is, that meeting the object at its entrance into the  
country, the colle&amp;ion is drawn to a pomt, and so tar Amplified ;  
the other is, that it avoids the poflibilitv of interference between  
the regulations of-lhc United States, and thofeofthe particular slates.  
But a duty, the precautions for the collection of which tliould  
terminate with the landing of the goods, as is essentially the cafe  
in the existing system, couid not, with falefy, be carried to the ex­  
tent, which is contemplated.  
In that fvftcm, the evasion of the duties, depends as it were, on  
a Tingle risk. To land the goods in defiance of the vigilance of  
the officers of the customs, is almofl, the lole difficulty. No future  
puiiuit, is materially, to be apprehended. And where the induc­  
mcnt is equivalent to the risk. there will be found too many, who  
arc willing to run it! Consequently there will be extensive frauds  
ot the revenue, againtl which the utmoil rigor of penal laws, has  
proved, as often as it has been tried, an ineffectual guard.  
The only expedient which has been discovered, for conciliating  
high duties with a fafe collection, is, the eltablilhment of a Jc­  
cond or interior scrutiny.  
By purfuingthe article, from its importation, into the hands of  
the dealers in it, the risk. of dete&amp; ion is so greatly inhanced,  
that few, in comparison, will venture to incur it. Indeed every  
dealer, who is not himtelf the fraudulent importer, then be­  
comes, in fomc fort, a cerjtincl upon him.  
The introduction of a system, founded on this principle, in  
some shape or other, is, in the opinion of the Secretary, eirential  
to the efficacy of every attempt, to render the revenues ot the Uni­  
ted States equal tD their exigencies, their fafety, their prosperity,  
their honor.  
  
Nor is it less &lt; Hernial to the interell of the hoheft and fair tra­  
der. It might even be added, that every individual citizen, be­  
sides his snare in the general weal, has a particular interell in it.  
The practice of-faniggliug never fails to have one or two effects, and  
fonictimes unites them both. Either the smuggler underfelh the  
frfir trader, as, by saving the he can afford to do* and makes  
:t a charge upon him ; or he fells at the intreafed price occafloned  
by the duty, and defiauds every man, who buys of him, of what  
the public ought to receive. For it is evident, that the loss falls  
ultimately upon the citizens, who mud be charged with other tax­  
es to make good the deficiency, and supply the wants of the ftaie.  
The Secretary will not preiume, that the plan* which he fhal 1  
fubmitto the confidcration of the House, is the bed that could be  
devised. But it is the one, which has appeared to him freed from  
objc£Hons of any, that has occurred ot equal efficacy. He ac­  
knowledges too, that it is susceptible of improvement, by other  
precautions in favor of the revenue, which he did not think it ex­  
pedient to add. The chief outlines ot the plan arc not original,  
but it is no ill recommendation of it, that it has been tried With  
success.  
  
The Secretary accordingly proposes,  
That the duties heretofore laid upon wines, dillilled fpirit6,  
teas and coffee, should, after the last day of May next, ctafe, and  
that instead of them, the following duties be laid.—  
Upon every gallon of Madeira Wine, oi the quality of London  
particular, thirty-five cents.  
Upon every gallon of other Madeira Wine, thirty cents.  
Upon every gallon ot Sherry, twenty-five cents.

Upon every gallon of those. Spirits, more than forty per cent,  
above proof, according to the fame hydrometer, twenty-five  
  
ccnts.  
That upon all Stills employed in distilling Spirits from mate­  
rials of the growth or produfction of the United States, in any other  
place, than a city, town or village, there be paid the yearly sum of  
lixty cents, for ever) gallon, Englilh wine mcafure, of the capadi­  
tv of each Still, including its head.  
The Secretary does not distribute the duties on Teas into dif­  
ferent classes, as has been done in the import ast of the last feflion ;  
because this distribution depends on conliderations of commercial  
policy, not ot revenue. It is fufficicnt, therefore, for nim to re-;  
mark, that the rates, above fpccified, are proposed with refer­  
ence to the lowcft class.

report  
el the SECRETARY of the TREASURY to the  
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES.  
Treasury Department, Jan. 9, J790.  
[continuation.]  
T H E Secretary conceiving, that he could not convey an ac­  
-1 curate idea of the plan contemplated by him, for the-collec­  
tion of these duties in any mode so effectual as by the draft of a  
bill for the puipote, begs leave rcfpeatu.ly to refer the Houf  
that, which will be found annexed to this report, relatively to the  
article of distilled spirits ; and which, for the better explanation  
of some of its parts, is accompanied with marginal remaiks.  
It would be the intention of the Secretary, that the duty on  
wines Ihould be collected upon precisely the fame plan with that  
on imported spirits. . . ,  
But with regard to teas and coffee, the Secretary is inclined to  
think, that it will be expedient, till experience (hall evince the  
propriety of goirtg further, to exclude the ordinary right of the of­  
ficers tovifit and mfpeft the places in which those articles maybe  
kept. The other precautions, without this, will afford, though  
not complete, considerable security. c  
It will notefcape the observation of the House, that the Secre­  
tary, in the plan submitted, has taken the most scrupulous care,  
that those citizens upon whom it is immediately to operate, be  
fecurcd from every species of injury by the mifcomduaof the of­  
ficers to be employed. There are not only (Uong guaids aga.nlt  
their being guilty of abuses of authority ; they are not only pun­  
ilhable, criminally, for any they may commit, and made anlwer­  
able in damages, to individuals, for whatever prejudice they may  
fullain by their acts or neglects : But even where fe.zures are  
made with probable cause, if there be an acquittal of the article  
seized, a compensation to the-proprietors for the injury their pro­  
perty may fuller, and even for its detention, is to be made out 01  
the public treasury. .  
So solicitous indeed has the Secretary been, to obviate every ap­  
pearance of hardship, that he has even included a compensation to  
the dealers, for their agency in aid of the revenue.  
- With all these precautions to mamfefta spirit of moderation and  
justice on the part of the government : And when it is considered,  
that the objefl of the proposed system is the firm eltablifhment ot  
public credit ; that oil this depends the charatler, iecurity and  
prosperity of the nation ; that advantages in every light important,  
may be expected to result from it tltat the immediate operation  
of it will be upon an enlightened class of citizens, zealouuy devo­  
ted to good government, and to a liberal and enlarged policy,  
and that it is peculiarly theintereft of the virtuous pari of them to  
co-operate in whatever will restrain the spirit of illicit traffic ; there  
will be perceived to exist, the jufteft ground of confidence, that the  
plan, if eligible in itfelf, will experience the chearful and prompt  
acquiescence of the community.  
The Secretary computes the nett product of the duties propoted  
in this report at about one million seven hundred and three thou -  
land four hundred dollars, according to the estimate in the fched­  
dulc K, which it near the truth, will, together with the probable  
product of the duties on imports and tonnage, complete the sum  
required. But it will readily occur, that in so unexplored a held  
there mud be a considerable degree of uncertainty in the data.  
And that, on this account, it *rill be prudent to have an auxiliary  
resource for the firft year, in which the interest will become pay.  
able, that there may De no poflibility of disappointment to the  
public creditors, ere there may be an opportunity of providing for  
any deficiency, which the experiment may discover. This will  
accordingly be attended to.  
The proper appropriation of the funds provided, and to be pro­  
vided, seems next to offer itfelf to connderation.  
On this head, the Secretary would propose, that the duties on  
diflillcd spirits, should be applied in the firft instance, to the pay­  
ment of the interest of the foreign debt.  
That reserving out of the residue of those duties an annual sum  
of fix hundred thousand dollars, for the current feiviccof the Uni­  
ted States ; the surplus, together with the product ol the other du­  
ties, be applied to the payment of the interest on the new loan,  
by an appropriation, co-exlcnfive with the duration of the debt.  
And that it any part of the debt should remain unfubferibed,  
the excess of the revenue be divided among the creditors of the un­  
fubferibed part, by a temporary disposition : with a limitation,  
however, to four per cent.  
It will hardly have been unnoticed, that the Secretary has been  
thus far silent on the fubjeft of the poftrofftce. Tiie reason is, thati  
he has had in view thp application of the revenue arising from th?  
source, to the purpofesof a finking fund. The   
Tal gives it as his opinion, that the immediate product ot it, u   
a proper arrangement, would probably be, not less than one&#x27;  
red thousand dollars. And from its nature, with 800^)me a  
agemenf, it must be a growing, and will,be likely to b&quot;  
considerable fund. The post-master-general is now c® uion  
preparing a plan, which will be tbe foundation of a )me 0  
for a new arrangement of the eOablifhmpnt. Thjs, &quot; . ,  
ther points relative to the fubjeft referred to the See* ar)&#x27;  
leave to reserve for a future report. f , ,  
Persuaded as the Secretary is, that the pror* 1£ 1 _  
present debt, will render it a national blernm; c ,IC ls f°  
from acceding to the position, in the latitu&lt;*. ,m u   
times laid down, thaf&quot; public debts benefits, a po­  
sition inviting to prodigality, and liabl-° max-  
United States, the  
creation of debt should alwavs b&#x27;&quot;accoJT1Panitc %vll 1 ,  
extinguilhment. This he rega-&quot; &quot; &lt;he m,c  
public credit immortal. An.*6 prcf&quot;™&quot;. that it is difficult to  
conceive a situation, in whL&#x27;1 &#x27;here may not earll erc&quot;&#x27; . .  
the maxim. At lead he ecls an unlcigncd folipitude, that this  
may be attempted by t&quot; Un&quot;tfl Sl*&quot;&gt; em­  
inence their meafu.e for the eftabl.lhment of credit, with the ob­  
lervance of it. . , .  
Under this im/teflion, the Secretary proposes, that the nett pro­  
duct of the po*-office, to a sum not exceeding oik: million ot dol­  
lars be vefW in cominiffioncrs, to consist of the Vice-President  
of the United States or Prcfident of the Senate, the Speaker of the  
House of Jieprefentatives, the Chief Justice, Secretary of the I rea­  
fury andAttorney-Gcneralofthe United States,tor the time J)cing,in  
trust übe applied, by them,or any three of them,to thedifcharge of  
the rxifting public debt,either by pur chafes ot stock in the market,  
or by payments on account ot the principalis shall appear to thein  
most advifeable, in conformity to the public engagements ; to  
contirtuc so vested, until the whale ot the debt shall be discharged.  
As an additional expedient for cfFefting a reduction of the debt,  
and for other purposes which will be mentioned, the Secretary  
would further propose thai the fame commiflioners be authorised,  
With the approbation of the President ot the United States, to  
1 orrow, on their credit, a sum, not exceeding twelve millions of  
dollars, to be applied,  
First. To the payment of theintereft and inftalmen&#x27;s of the  
foreign debt, to the end of the present year, which will require  
,923 dollai s, and 46 cents.  
Secondly. To the payment of any deficiency which may hap­  
pen in the prodiift of the funds provided for paying the interest  
of I he domeflic debt.  
Thirdly. To the effeftinga change in the form of such part of  
the foreign debt, as bears an interest of five per cent. It is con­  
ceived, that, for this purpose, a new loan, at a lower interest, may  
be combined with other expedients. The remainder of this pirt of  
the debt, after paying the instalments, which will accrue in the  
course of 1790, will be j,8&amp;8;8#8 dollars, and 81 cents.  
Fourthly. To the purchase of the public debt at the price it  
(hall bear in the market, while it continues below its true value  
This measure, which would be, in the opinion of the Secretary,  
highly diihonorable to the govern men&#x27;, if it were to precede a  
  
provision for funding the deDt, wou.u  
ccptionablc, after that had been made. Its effect would.be ata  
vor of thepUbl,c creditors, as it would tend to raise the value of  
stock. And ,11 the d,fference, between its true value, and the  
actual price, would be so much clear gain to the public Th  
payment of foreign mtereft on the capital to be borrowed tor this  
pu. pole, (hould that be a necessary confluence, would not in  
the judgment of the Secretary, be a good object.on to th m ■  
furc. The saving by the operation would be ltfelf, a fuflkiem in­  
demnitv ; and the employment of that capital in a  
tuatcd like this,would much motethan compcnfate for it liefide.,  
if the government does not undertake this operation, the fame - ,  
&#x27;convenience, which the objection in question supposes, would  
happen in another way, with a ctrcumftance of aggravation As  
ilong, at lead, as the debt lhall continue below its proper value,  
.it will be an objea of speculation to foreigners, who will not on­  
lv receive the interest, upon what they purchase, and &#x27;em.t   
broad, as in the cafe of the loan, but will reap theaddif.onil pro­  
: fit of the difFcrence in value. By the government into a  
competition with them, it will not only reap a part of h s Pro .  
itfelf, but will contraathe extent, and lefltn the extra profit of  
foieign purchases. That competition will accelerate the rife  
stock; and whatever greater rate this obliges foreigners to pay,  
for what they purchase, is so much clear saving to the nation I  
the opinion of the Secretary, and contrary to an idea which is not  
! without patrons, it ought to be the pol.cy of the goven,mcm,to  
raise the value of stock to its true standard as tact as poflible Whe  
&#x27;it arrives to that point, foreign fpecuhtionsfwhichtllthen  
mud be deemed pernicious, further than as they serve to bring it  
to that point) will tecome beneficial. Their money  
this country, upon our agriculture commerce and   
will produce much more to us, than the income they will re­  
ceive from it. r ,  
The Secretary contemplates the application of this montf  
through the medium of a national bank, for which, withi the jt  
million of the House, he will submit a plan in thecoutfe o/  
The Secretary now proceeds, in the last place, to  
confide,at,on of the House, h,s ideas, of the ft.ps, «£»

I havc prefenbed iu relation to the debt of the United  
  
: StTh s /atary has now completed the object}, which he pro-  
I fJC &#x27;&#x27;lmfelf, to comprise in the present report. He has, for  
1 f™&#x27; part, omited details, as well to avoid fatiguing the at­  
j of the Houfj, as becaufemoTetime would have been defira­  
[ m&quot; &#x27;ep to digest the general principles of the p&#x27;an- &#x27; jC.  
&#x27; be found right, the particular modifications will readily  
1 f-cgeft thcmfelvesm the progress of the work.  
The Secretary, in the views which have direGed his purluit of  
the lubicft, has been influenced, in the firft place, by the considera­  
tion, that his duty from the very terms of the resolution of the  
House, obliged him to propose what appeared to him an adequate  
provision for the support of the public crcdit, adapted at the fame  
time to the real circumftancei of the United States; and in the  
next, by the reflection, that measures which will not bear the ten  
of future unbiased examination, can neither be produOivc of in­  
dividual reputation, nor (which is of much greater consequence) A  
public honor, or advantage  
Deeply imprefled, as the Secretary is, with a full and deliberate  
conviaion, that the eftablilhmcnt ot public credit, upon the basis  
of a fatisfaftory provision, for the public debt, is, undei the pre­  
sent circuroftances of this country, the true desideratum towards  
relief from individual and national cmbarraflments ; that without  
: it, these cmbarraflments will be likely to press flail more severely  
upon tli£ community—He cannot but indulge an anxious wirn,  
that an elFt&amp;ual plan for thai purpofc may, during the prclent fql­  
fion, be the result of the uuited wisdom of thf. lecifl-iture.  
He is fully convinced, that it is of the greatest importance, that  
no further delay should attend the making of the requisite provi­  
sion ; not only,&#x27; becaufc it will give a better imprelhon ot the good  
iaith of the country, and will bring earlier rebel to the creditors ;  
both which circumitances are of great moment to public credit::  
but, btcaufe the advantages to the community, from railing ltock,  
as speedily as poflible, to its natural\alue, will be incomparably  
greater, than any that can result from its cpntinuancc below that  
standard. No profit, which could be derived from Purc^fes ,n  
the market, on account of the government, to any practicable cx­  
! tent, would be an equivalent for the lols, which would be fuilain­  
ed bv the purchases of foreigners, at a low value. Not to repeat,  
that governmental purchases, to be honorable, ought to be preced­  
ed by a provision. Delay, by diflcminating doubt, would fink  
the price of stock ; and as the temptation to foreign speculations,  
from the lownefc of the price, would be too great to be neglected,  
mi lions would-probably be loft to the United States.  
All which is humbly submitted.

HE fecretary of che treafury, in obedience to the refoiution of the houfe of re-  
  
prefentatives, of the twenty-firft day of September laft, has, during the recels  
of congrefs, applied himfelf to the confideration #f a proper plan for the fupport of the  
public credit, with all the attention which was due to the authority of the houfe, and  
to che maguitade of the object.  
  
In the difcharge of this duty, he has felt, in no fmall degree, the anxieties which  
naturally flow from a juft eftimate of the difficulty of the tafk, from a well-founded  
ditlidence of his own qualifications for executing it withfuccefs, andfrom adeep and fo-  
Jemn conviction of the momentous nature of the truth contained in the refolution un-  
der which his inveltigations have been conducted, “ ‘That an adequate provifion for  
the fupport of the public credit, isa matter of high importance to the honour and  
proiperity of the united fates.”  
  
With an ardent delire that his well-meant endeavors may be conducive to the real  
advantage of the nation, and with the utmoft deference to the fuperior judgment of  
the houfe, he now refpeétfully fubmits the refult of his enquiries and reflections, to  
their indulgent conftruction.  
  
In the opinion of the fecretary, the wifdom of the houfe, in giving their explicit  
fanctivn to the propofition which has been ftated, cannot but be applauded by all,  
who will feriouily confider, and trace through their obvious confequences, thefe plain  
and undeniable truths.  
  
That exigencies are to be expected to occur, in the affairs of nations, in which there  
will be a neceflity for borrowing.—  
  
That loans in times of public danger, efpecially from foreign war, are found an ins  
difpenfable refource, even to the wealthiett of them.—  
  
And that in a country, which, like this, is poffeffed of little a@ive wealth, or in o-  
ther words, littie monied capital, the neceflity for that refource, muft, in fuch emers  
gencies, be proportionably urgent.  
  
And as on the one hand, the neceflity for borrowing in particular emergencies can-  
not be doubted, fo on the other, it is equally evident, that to be able to borrow upon  
geod terms, it is efleniial that the credit of a nation {hould be well eftablithed.  
  
For when the credit of a country is in any degree queftionable, it never fails to give  
an extravagant premium, in one fhape or another, upon all the loans it has occafion to  
make. Nor does the evil end here; the fame difadvantage muft be fuftained upoa  
whatever is to be bought on terms of future payment.  
  
From this conttant neceflity of borrowing and buying dear, it is eafy to conceive how  
immenfely the expences of a nation, in a courfe of time, will be augmented by an un-  
found ftate of the public credit.  
  
‘To attempt to cnumerate the complicated variety of mifchiefs in the whole fyftem  
of the focial economy, which proceed from a neglect of the maxims that uphold pub-  
lic credit, and jultify the folicitude manifefted by the houfe on this point, would be am  
um proper inwulion on their time and patience.  
  
  
  
  
  
Political Regifter. 131  
  
S  
  
  
  
In fo ftrong a light neverthelefs do they appear to the fecretary, that on their due  
abfervance at the prefent critical juncture, materially depends, in his judgment, the  
individual and aggregate profperity of the citizens of the united flates; their relief  
from the embarraflments they now experience ; their character asa people ; the caufe  
of good government.  
  
If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly fo important, the next enquiry  
which fuggefts itfelf is, by what means it is to be effected ? Phe ready anfwer to  
which queltion is, by good faith, by a punctual performance of contracts. States, like  
individuals, who obferve their engagements, are refpeted and trufted: while the re-  
verfe is the fate of thofe who pur{ue an oppofite conduct.  
  
Every breach of the public engagements, whether from choice or neceflity, is in dif-  
ferent degrees hurtful to public credit. When fuch a necefliry does truly exift, the e-  
vils of it are only to be palliated by a fcrupulous attention, on the part of the govern-  
ment, to carry the violation no farther than the necellity abfolutely requires, aad to  
manifeft, if the mature of the cafe admits of it, a fincere difpofition to make reparation,  
whenever circumftances thal] permit. But with every poflible mitigation, credit mut  
fuffer, and numerous mifchiefs enfue. It is therefore highly important, when an ap-  
pearance of neceflity feems to prefs upon the public councils, that they fhould exa.  
mine well its reality, and be perfeCly affured, that there is no method of efcaping  
from it, before they yield to its fuggeftions. For though it cannot fafely be affirmed,  
that occafions have never exifted, or may not exift, in which violations of the public  
faith, in this refpect, are inevitable; yet there is great reaion to believe, that they ex-  
it far lefs frequently than precedents indicate; and are ofteneft cither pretended  
through levity, or want of firmnefs, or fuppofed through want of knowledge, Ex-  
pedients might often have been deviled to effect, confiltently with good faith, what  
has been done in contravention of it. Thofe who are moft commonly creditors of a  
nation, are, generally fpeaking, enlightened men; and there are fignal examples to  
warrant aconclufiun, that when a candid and fair appeal is made to them, they will  
underftand their true intereft too well, to refufe their concurrence in fuch modifications  
of their claims, as any real neceflity may demand.  
  
While the obfervance of that good faith, which is the bafis of public credit, is re-  
commended by the ftrongeft inducements of political expediency, it is enforced by con-  
fiderations of ftill greater authority. There are arguments for it, which reit on the  
immutable principles of moral obligations. And in proportion as the mind is dif-  
pofed to contemplate, in the order of Providence, an intimate connection between pub-  
lic virtue and public happineds, will be its repugnancy to a violation of thofe principles.  
  
This reflection derives additional ftrength from the nature of the debt of the united  
fates. It was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledg-  
ed for it, and with folemnities that give peculiar force to the obligation. There is in-  
deed reafon to regret that it has not hitherto been kept; that the neceflities of the war,  
confpiring with inexperience in the fubjects of finance, produced dire&amp; infractions ;  
and that the fubfequent period has been a continued fcene of negative violation, or  
nen-compliance. But a diminution of this regret arifes from the reflection, that the  
laR feven years have exhibited an carneft and uniform effort, on the part of the go~  
vernment of the union, tu retrieve the national credit, by doing juftice to the creditors  
of the nation; and that the embarraflments of a defective conttitution, which defeat-  
ed this laudable effort;have ceafed.  
  
From this evidence of a favorable difpofition, given by the former government, the  
inftitution of a new one, cloathed with powers competent to calling forth the refources  
of the community, has excited corre{pondent expectations. A general belief, accord-  
ingly, prevails, that the credit of the united ftates will quickly be eftablifhed, on the  
firm foundation of an effe&amp;tual provifion for the exifling debt. The influence, which  
this had at home, is witneffed by the rapid increafe that has taken place in the mare  
ket value of the public fecurities. From January te November, they rofe thirty-three  
and a third per cent, and from that period to this time, they have rifen fifty per cent  
more. And the intelligence from abroad announces effects proportionably favourable  
tw our national credit and confequence.  
  
It cannot but merit particular atcrention, that among ourfelves, the moft enlightened  
friends of good government are thofe, whofe expectations are the highett.

its due value; to furnifh new refources both to agriculture and commerce ; to cement  
more clofely the union of the {lates ; to add to their fecurity aganft foreign attack ; tp  
eftablith public order on the bafis of an upright and liberal policy —Thefe are the  
great and invaluable ends to be ‘ecured, by a proper and adequate provifion, at the  
prefent period, for the fupport of public credit.  
  
To this provifioy we are invited, not only by the general confiderations, which  
have been noticed, but by others of a more particular nature, It will procure to eve.  
ry clafs of the community fome important advantages, and remove fome no lefs impor.  
tant difadvantages.  
  
‘The advantage to the public creditors, from the increafed value of that part of their  
property which conttitutes the public debt, needs no explanation.  
  
But there is a conicquence of this, lefs obvious, though not lefs true, in which every  
other citizen is interetted. It isa well known fact, that in countries in which the na-  
tional debt is properly funded, and an object of eftablifhed confidence, it anfwers mot  
of the purpofes ef money. ‘Transfers of flock or public debt are there equivalent to  
payments in fpecie; or, in other words, ftcck, in the principal tranfadtions of bufinefi,  
pailes current as fpecie.—The fame thing would, in all probability, happen here un-  
der the like circumttances.  
  
‘The benefits of thisare various and obvious-———  
  
Firft. Trade is extended by it; becaufe there isa larger capital to carry it on, and  
the merchant can at the fame time, afford to trade for fmaller profits; as his ftock,  
which, whea unemployed, brings him in an interefit frem the government, ferves him  
alfu as moucy, when he has a call for it in his commercial operations.  
  
Secondly. Agriculture and manufactures are allo promoted by it : For the like  
reafon, that more capital can be commanded to be employed in both ; and becaufe the  
merchant, whole enterprize in forcign trade, gives to them activity and cxtenfion, has  
greater means for enterprize.  
  
Thirdly. The intereft of money will be lowered by it; for this is always in a ratio,  
the quantity of money, and to the quicknefs of circulation. ‘This circumftance will  
cvable both the public and individuals to borrow on eafier and cheaper terms.  
  
And from the combination of thefe effets, additional aids will be furnifhed to la-  
bour, to induftry, and to arts of every kind.  
  
Bur thefe good cffects of a public debt are only to be looked for, when, by being  
well funded, it has acquired an adegwate and fable value. ‘Tillthen, it has rather a  
contrary tendency. The flu@tuation and infecurity incident to it in an unfonded  
ftate, render it a mere commodity, and a precarious one. As fuch, being ouly an objet  
of eccafional and particular fpeculation, all the money applied to it is fo much divert-  
ed from the more uleful channels of circulation, for which the thing itfelf affords no  
fubftitute : So that, in fa&amp;, one ferious inconvenience of an unfunded debt is, that it  
contributes to the fcarcity of money.  
  
‘This diltinction, which has been little if at all attended to, is. of the greateft mo-  
ment. It involves a quefiion immediately interefting to every part of the communi-  
ty; which is no other than this—Whether the public debt, by a provifion for it on  
true principles, fhall be rendered a /wbfitute for money ; or whether, by being left as  
it is, or by being provided for in fuch a manner as wil] wound thofe principles, and de-  
itr»y confidence, it fhail be fufiered to continue, as it is, a pernicious drain of our cath  
from the channels of productive indultry.  
  
‘Lhe eftect which the funding of the public debt, on right principles, would have  
upon landed property, is one of the circumftances attending fuch an arrangement,  
which has been lealt adverted to, though it deferves the moft particular attention.  
The prefent depreciated ftate of that {pecies of property is a ferious calamity. The  
value of cultivated lands in moft of the Rates, has fallen fince the revolution, from 25  
to soper cent. In thofe farthett fouth, the decreafe is {till more confiderable. Indeed,  
if the reprefentations, continually received from that quarter, may be credited, lands  
there will command no price, which may not be deemed an almoft total facrifice.  
  
‘Lhis decreafe, in the value of lands, ought, ia a great meafure, to be attributed to  
the icarcity of money.—Confequently, whatever produces an augmentation of the mo-  
nied copital of the country, muit have a proportional effee in raifing that value. ‘The  
beneficial tendency of a funded debt, in this refpect, has been manifested by the mok  
decilive expericnce in Great-Britain,  
  
  
  
  
  
Political Revifter. 133  
  
  
  
The proprietors of lands would not only feel the benefit of this increafe in the va-  
lue of their property, and of a more prompt and better fale, when they had occafion  
to fell; but the neceflity of felling would be, itfelf, greatly diminifhed. As the fame  
caufe would contribute to the facility of loans, there is reafon to believe, that fuch of  
them as are indebted, would be able, through that refource, to fatisfy their more ur-  
gent creditors.  
  
It ought not however to be expected, that the advantages, defcribed as likely to re-  
fult from funding the public debt, would be inftuntancous. [t might require fome  
time to bring the value of ftock to its natural level, and to attach to it that fixed con-  
fidence, which is neccflary to its quality as money. Yet the late rapid rife ofthe pub-  
lic fecurities encourages an expectation, that the progrefs of ftock to the defireable  
point, will be much more expeditious than could have been forefeen. And as in the  
mean time it will be increafing in value, there is room to conclude, that it will from  
the outfet, anfwer many of the purpofes in contemplation. Particularly it feems to be  
  
robable, that from creditors, who are not themfelves necefflitous, it will early meet  
with a ready reception in payment of debts, at its current price.  
  
Having now taken a concife view of the inducements to a proper provifion for the  
public debt, the next enquiry which prefents itfelf is, what ought to be the nature of  
fuch a provifion ? This requires fome preliminary difcuflions.  
  
It is agreed on all hands, that that part of the debt which has been contracted a-  
broad, and is denominated the forcign debt, ought to bé’provided for, according to  
the precife terms of the contracts relating to it. ‘The difcuffions, which can arife,  
therefore , will have reference effentially to the demeftic part of it, or to that which  
has been contracted at home. It is to’ be regretted, that there is not the fame unani-  
mity of fentiment On this part, as on the other.  
  
The Secretary has too much deference forthe opinions of every part of the com-  
munity, not to have obferved onc, which has, more than once, made its appearance in  
the public prints, and which is eccafionally to be met with in converfation. It involves  
this queftion, whether a diferimination ought not to be made betweer: original hold-  
ers of the public fecurities, and prefent pe fleffors, by purchafe. ‘Thofe who advocate  
a difcrimination are for making a ful! provifion fur the fecurit&#x27;es of the former, at  
their nominal value; but contend, that the latter ought to receive no more than the  
coft to them, and the intereft : And the idea is fometimes fuggefted of making good  
the difference to the primitive poffeffor.  
  
In favour of this fcheme, it is alledged, that it would be unreafonable to pay twenty  
fhillings in the pound, to one who had not given more for it than three or four. And  
it is added, that it would be hard to aggravate the misfortune of the firft ewner, who,  
probably through neceflity, parted with his property at fo great a lofs, by obliging  
him to contribute to the profit of the perfon, who had fpeculated on his diftreffes.  
  
The Secretary, after the moft mature reflection on the force of this argument, is in-  
duced to reje&amp; the do@rine it contains, as equally unjuft and impolitic, as highly inju-  
rious to the original holders of public fecurities ;—as ruinous to public credit.  
  
It is inconfiRtent with juftice, becaufe in the firit place, it is a breach of contrac ; in  
violation of the rights of a fair purchafer.  
  
The nature of the contract in its origin, fs, that the public wil! pay the fum expreff-  
ed in the fecurity, to the firft holder, or his afignee. ‘The intent, in making the fecuri-  
ty affignable, is, that the proprietor may be able to make ule of his property, by fell-  
ing it for as much as it may be worth in the market, and that the buyer may be /2f in  
the purchafe.  
  
Every buyer therefore ftands exactly in the place of the feller—has the fame right  
with him to the identical fum expreffed in the fecurity, and having acquired that

government, his claim cannot be difputed, without mianifelt injuftice.  
  
That he is to be confidered as a fair purchafer,refults from this : Whatever neceflity  
the feller may have been under, was occafioned by the government, in not making a  
proper provifion for its debts. ‘lhe buyer had no zgency in it, and therefore ought  
not to fuffer. He isnot even chargeable with having taken an undue advantage.  
He paid what the commodity was worth in the market, and took the rifks of rcim-  
burfement upon himfelf. He of courfe gave a fais equivalent, and ought to reap the  
benefit of his hazard; a hazard which was far from inconti erable, and whici

134 Political Regifter.  
  
That the cafe of thofe, who parted with their fecurities from neceflity, is a hard one,  
eannet be denied. But whatever complaint of injury, or claim of redrefs, they may  
have, reipects the government folely. They have not only nothing to object to the  
perfons who relieved their neceffities, by giving them the current price of their pro-  
perty, but they are even under an implied condition to contribute to the reimburfe-  
ment of thofe perfons. They knew, that by the terms of the contract with themfelves,  
the public were bound to pay to thofe, to whom they fhould cenvey their title, the  
fums ftipulated to be paid to them; and, that as citizens of the united ftates, they  
were to bear their proportion ef the contribution for that purpofe. This, by the a@  
of aflignment, they tacitly engaged to do; and if they had an option, they could not,  
with integrity or good faith, refufe to do it, without the confent of thofe to whom they  
fold.  
  
But though many of the original holders fold from neceflity, it does nat follow,  
that this was the cafe with all of them. It may well be fuppofed, that fome of them  
did it, either through want of confidence in an eventual provifion, or frum the alliure-  
ments of fome profitable fpeculation. How fhall thefe different claffes be difcrimi-  
nated from each other? How fhall it be afcertained, im any cafe, that the money  
which the original holder obtained for his fecurity, was not more beneficial to him,  
than if he had held it to the prefent time, to avail himfeli of the provilion which hall  
be made ? How fhall it be known, whether if the purchaler had employed his money  
in fome other way, he would not be ina better fituation than by having applied it in  
the purchafe of fecurities, though he fhould now receive their fullamount? And if  
neither of thefe things can be known, how fhail it be determined whether a difcri-  
mination, independent of the breach of contract, would not do a real injury to pur-  
chafers ; and if it included a compenfation to the primitive proprietors, would not  
give them an advantage, to which they had no equitable pretenfion.  
  
It may well he imagined, alfo, that there are not wanting initances, in which in-  
dividuals, urged by a prefent neceflity, parted with the fecurities received by them  
from the public, and fhortly after replaced them with others, as an indemnity for  
their firft lofs. Shall they be deprived of the indemnity which they have endeavour-  
ed to fecure by fo provident an arrangement ?  
  
Queftions of this fort, on a clofe infpection, multiply themfelves without ed, and  
demonttrate the injuftice of a difcrimination , even on the moft fubtile calculations of  
equity, abftracted from the obligation of contract.  
  
The difficulties too of regulating the details of a plan for that purpofe, which would  
have even the femblance of equity, would be found immenfe.——It may well be  
doubted whether they would not be infurmountable, and replete with fuch abfurd, as  
well as inequitable confequences, as to difguit even the propofers of the meafure.  
  
Asa fpecimen of its capricious operation, it will be fuflicient to notice the effed it  
would have upon two perfons, who may be fuppofed two years ago to have purchafed,  
each, fecurities at three fhillings in the pound, and one of them to retain thofe bought  
by him, till the difcrimination fhould take place ; the other to have parted with thofe  
dDought by him, within a month paft, at nine fhillings. The former, who had had  
mot confidence in the government, would in this cafe euly receive at the rate of three  
fhillings and the intereft ; while the latter, who had had lefs confidence, would re-  
ceive, for what cof bim the fame money, at the rate of nine fhillings, and his reprefenta-  
tives, fanding in bis place, would be entitled to a like rate  
  
The impolicy of a difcrimination refults from two confiderations ; one, that it pros  
ceeds upon a principle deftructive of that quality of the public debt, or the flock of  
the nation, which is effential to its capacity for anfwering the purpofes of money  
that is, the /ecurity of transfer; the other, that as well on this account, as becaufe it  
includes a breach of faith, it renders property in the funds lefs valuable; confequently  
induces lenders to demand a higher premium for what they lend, and produces every  
other inconvenience of a bad fatc of public credit.  
  
It will be perceived, at firft fight, that the tramsferable quality of flock is effential  
to its operation as money, and that this depends on the idea of complete fecurity to  
the transferree, and a firm perfuafion that no diftinction can in any circumfances be  
made between him and the original proprietor.  
  
The precedent of an invafion of this fundamental principle, would of courfe tend  
to deprive the community of an advantege, with which ao temporary faving could  
bear the leat comparifer.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Political Regifter. 135  
  
And it will as readily be perceived, that the fame caufe would operate a diminution  
ef the value of flock in the hands of the fir, as well as of every other holder. The  
price which any man, who fhould incline to purchafe, would be willing to give for  
jt, would be in a compound ratio to the immediate profit it afforded, and to the chance  
of the continuance of his profit. If there was fuppofed to be any hazard of the lat-  
ter, the rif would be taken into the calculation, and either there would be no pur-  
chafe at all, or it would be at a proportionably lefs price.  
  
For this diminution of the value of ftock, every perfon, who thould be about to  
lend to the government, would demand a compenfation ; and would add to the aStual  
difference, between the nominal and the market valuc, an equivalent for the chance  
of greater decreafe ; which, in a precarious ftate of public credit, is always to be  
taken into the account,  
  
Every compenfation of this fort, it is evident, would be an abfolute lofs to the go-  
vernment.  
  
In the preceding difcuflion of the impolicy of a difcrimination, the injurious ten-  
dency of it to thofe, who continue to be the holders of the fecurites they received  
from the government, has been explained. Nothing need be added, om this head,  
except that this is an additional and interefting light, in which the injuftice of the  
meaiure may be fecn. It would not only diveft prefent proprictors by purchafe, of  
the rights they had acquired under the fanétion of pnblic faith, but it would depre-  
ciate the property of the remaining original holders.  
  
It is equally unneceflary to add any thing to what has been already faid to demon-  
ftrate the fatal influence, which the principle of difcrimination would have on the  
public credit.  
  
But there is ftill a point in view, in which it will appear perhaps even more excep-  
tionable, than in either of the former. It would be repugnant te an exprefs provifion  
of the conftitution of the united ftates. This provifion is, that “ all debts contracted  
and engagements entered into before the adoption of the conftitution, fhall be as va~  
lid againft the united ftates under it, as under the confederation,” which amounts to  
a conftitutional ratification of the contracts refpeCling the debt, in the ftate in which  
they exifted under the confederation. And reforting to that ftandard, there can be  
no doubt, that the rights of aflignees, and original holders, muft be confidered as equal.  
  
In exploding thus fully the principle of difcrimination, the fecretary is happy in re-  
flecting, that he is only the advocate of what has been already fanctioned by the for-  
mal and exprefs authority of the government of the union, in thefe emphatic terms  
—— The remaining clafs of creditors (fay congrefs in their circular addrefs to the  
ftates, of the aéth.of April, 1783) is compofed, partly of fuch of our fellow-citizens  
as originally lent to the public the ufe of their funds, or have fince manifefted the mof  
confidence in their country, by receiving transfers from the lenders; and partly of thofe,  
whofe property has been either advanced or affumed for the public fervice. To dif-  
eriminate the merits of thefe feveral deferiptions of creditors, would be a tafk equally  
unneceflary and invidious. If the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favour of  
fome than of others, the voice of policy, no lefs than of juftice, pleads in favour of  
all. A wise nation will never permit thofe who relieve the wants of their coun-  
try, or who rely moff on its faith, its fArmnefi and its refources, when cither of them is  
diftruhted, to fuffer by the event.”  
  
The feeretary concluding, that a difcrimination between the different clafles of  
creditors of the united ftaces, cannot with propriety be made, proceeds to examine  
whether a difference ought to be permitted to remain between them, and another de-  
{cription of public creditors—Thofe of the ttates individually.  
  
The fecretary, after mature reficction on this point, entertains a full conviction, that  
an aflumption of the debts of the particular ftates by the union, and a like provilion  
for them, as for thofe of the union, will be a meafure of found policy and fubftantial  
ju tice.  
  
It would, in the opinion of the fecretary, contribute, in an eminent degree, to as  
orderly, ftable, and fatisfaory arrangement of the national finances.  
  
Admitting, as ought to be the cafe, that a provifion muft be made in fome way or  
other for the entire debt, it will follow, that no greater revenues will be required,  
whether that provifion be made wholly by the united Rates, or partly by them, aad  
partly by the ttates feparacely.

136 . Political Regifter.  
  
The principal queftion then mutt be, whether fuch a provifion cannot be more con.  
veniently and effectually made, by one general plan iffuing from one authority, than  
by different plans originating in different authorities.  
  
In the fir cafe, there can be no competition for refources ; in the laft, there mut  
be fuch a competition. ‘he confequences of this, without the yreateft caution on  
both fides, might be interfering regulations, and thence collifion and confufion. Par.  
ticular branches of induftry might alfo be oppreffed by it. The moft productive ob.  
jects of revenue are not numerous. Either thefe muft be wholly engroffed by one  
fide, which might leffen the efficacy of the provifions by the other; or both mut  
have recourfe to the fame objets in different modes, which might occafion an accu.  
mulation upon them, beyond what they could properly hear. If this fhould not hap.  
pen, the caution requifite to avoiding it, would prevent the revenue’s deriving the  
full benefit of each object. The danger of interference and of excefs would be apt to  
impofe reftraints very unfriendly to the complete command of thofe refources, which  
are the moft convenient ; and to compel the having recourfe to others, lefs eligible  
in themfelves, and lefs agreeable to the community.  
  
The difficulty of an effetual command of the public refources, in cafe of feparate  
provifion for the debt, may be feen in another, and perhaps more ftriking light. tt  
would naturally happen that different ftates, from local confiderations, would in fome  
inftances have recourfe to different objets, in others, to the fame objects, in different  
degrees, for procuring the funds ef which they ftood in need. It is eafy to conceive  
how this diverfity would affe&amp;t the aggregate revenue of the country. By the fuppo-  
fition, articles which yielded a full fupply in fome flates, would yield nothimz, or an  
infufficient produét, in others. And hence the public revenue would not derive the  
full benefit of thofe articles, from ftate regulations. Neither could the deficiencies be  
made good by thofe of the union. It is a provifion of the national conftitution, that  
“ all duties, impofts, and excifes, fhall be uniform throughout the united ftates.”” And  
as the general government would be under anecefliry, frem motives of policy, of pay-  
ing regard to the duty, which may have been previoufly impofed upon any article,  
though but in a fingle fate, it would be conftrained, cither to refrain wholly from  
any further impofition, upon fuch article, where it had been already rated as high as  
was proper, or to confine itfelf to the difference between the exifting rate, and what  
the article would reafonably bear. Thus the pre-ocewpancy of an article by a fingle  
ftate, would tend to arreft or abridge the impefitions of the union on that article.  
And as it is fuppofeable, that a great varicty of articles might be placed in this fitua-  
tion, by diflimilar arrangements of the particular ftates, it is evident, that the aggre-  
gate revenue of the country would be likely to be very materially contracted by the  
plan of feparate provifions.  
  
if all the public creditors receive their dues from one fource, diftributed with an  
equal hand, their intereft will be the fame. And having the fame interefts, they  
will unite in the fupport of the fifcal arrangements of the governmant: As thefe,  
too, can be made with more convenience, where there is no competition : Thefe cir-  
cumftances combined will infure to the revenue laws a more ready and more fatisfac-  
tory execution.  
  
If, on the contrary, there are diftin&amp; proyifions, there will be diftin@ interefts,  
drawing different ways. That union and concert of views, among the creditors,  
which in every government is of great importance to their fecurity, and to that of  
=. credit, will not only not cxift, but will be likely to give place to mutual jea-  
  
oufy and oppofition. And from this caufe, the operation of the fyftems which may  
be adopted, both by the particular ftates, and by the union, with relation to their re-  
fpective debts, will be in danger of being counteracted.  
  
There are feveral reafons which render it probable, that the fituation of the ftate  
creditors would be worfe than that of creditors of the union, if there be not a national  
affumption of the flate debts. Of thefe, it will be futlicient to mention two; one,  
that a principal branch of revenue is exclufively vetted in the union; the other, that a  
ftate mult always be checked in the impofition of taxes on articles of confumption,  
from the want of power to extend the fame regulations to the other ftates, and from  
the tendency of partial duties to injure its induftry and commerce. Should the  
ftate creditors ftand upon a lefs eligible footing than the others, it is unnatural to ex-  
pect they would fee with pleafure a provifion for them. ‘Ibe influence which theis  
diffatisfaQion might have, could not but operate injurioufly, both for the creditors and  
the credit of the united fates. (To be continued.)

} ENCE it is even the intereft of the creditors of the union, that thole of the in.  
dividual ftates fhould be comprehended in a general provilion. Any attempt to  
fecure to the former either exclufive or peculiar advantages, would materially hazard  
their interefts.  
  
Neither would it be juft, that one clafs of the public creditors fhould be more fj.  
voured thanthe other. ‘The objects for which both defcriptions of the debt were  
contracted, are in the main the fame. Indeed a great part of the particular debts of  
the flates has arifen from aflumptions by them on account ef the union. And itis  
  
moft equitable , that there fhould be the tame meafure of retribution for all.  
  
There is an objection, however, to an ailumption of the ttate debts, which deferves  
  
articular notice. It may be fuppofed, that it would increafe the difhiculty of ane.  
quitable fertlement between them and the united fates.  
  
The principles of that fettlement, whenever they thall be difcuffed, will require all  
the moderation and wifdom of the government. Ip the opinionyof the fecretary,  
that difcuflion, till further lights are obtained, would be premature.  
  
All therefore which he would think advifable on the point in queftion, would be,  
that the amount of the debts allumed and provided for, fhould be charged to the n-  
ipective tates, to abide an eventual arrangement. ‘This, the united ftates, as aflignets  
tothe crediters, would have an indifputable right to do.  
  
But as it might be a fatisfadtion to the houfe to have before them fome plan for the  
liquidation of accounts between the union and its members, which, including the af-  
fumption of the ftate debts, would confl{t with equity : The feeretary will fabsnit in  
this place fuch thoughts on the fubject, as have occurred to his own mind, or been  
juggeited to him, moft compatible, in his judgment, with the end propoied,  
  
Let each ftate be charged with all the money advanced to it out of the treafury a  
the united ftates, liquidated according to the fpecie value at the time of each advance,  
with intereit at fix per cent.  
  
Let it aif be charged with the amount, in fpecie, of all its fecurities which fhall  
be afflumed, with the intereft upon them to the time when intereft thall become pay-  
able by the united fates.  
  
Let it be credited for all mories paid and articles furnithed to the united ftates, and  
for all other expenditures during the war, either towards general or particular de  
fence, whether authorifed or unauthorifed by the united ftates; the whole liquidated  
to {pecie value, and bearing an interelt of fix&#x27;per cent. from the feveral times at which  
the feveral payments, advances, and expenditures accrued.  
  
And letall fums of continental money now in the treafuries of the refpetive ftates,  
whieh fhall be paid into the treafury of che united ftates, be credited at {pecie value.  
  
Upon a {tatement of the accounts according to thefe principles, there can be litle  
doubt, that balances would appear in favour of all the fates, againft the united  
ftates.  
  
To equalize the contributions of the hood let each be then charged with its pro-  
portion of the aggregate of thofe balances, accerding to fome equitable ratio, to bk  
devifed for that purpole.  
  
&#x27; Ifthe contributions fhould be found difproportionate, the refult of this adjuftment  
would be, that fome fates would be creditors, fome debtors to the union.  
  
Should this be the cafe, at it will be attended with lefs inconvenience for the unit-  
ed ftates, to have to pay balances to, than to receive them from, the particular ftates, it  
may perhaps, be practicable to effect the former by a fecond procefs, im the nature of  
a tratisfer of the amount of the debts of debtor ftates, to the credit of creditor fates,  
obferying the ratio by which the firi apportionment fhall have becn made. This,

whilt it would deftroy the balances due from the former, would increafe thofe due to  
the latter. Thefe to be provided for by the united ftates, at a reafonaWle intereft, but  
not to be transferrable.  
  
‘The expediency of this fecond procefs mult depend on a knowledge of the refult of  
the firit. If the inequalities fhould be too great, the arrangement may be impractica-  
ble, without unduly increafing the debt of the united ftates. But it is not likely, that  
this would be the cafe. t isalfo to be remarked, that though this fecond procefs might  
not, upon the principle of apportionment, bring the thing to the point aimed at, yet  
it may approach fo nearly to it, as‘to avoid eflentially the embarraffmenc of having  
confiderable balances to collet from any of the ftatcs.  
  
The whole of thisarrangement may be under the {uperintendence of commiffion-  
ers, velted with eqaitable difcretion, and final authority.  
  
‘The general principle of the plan feems to be equitable, for it appears difficult to  
conceive a good reafon, why the expences for the particular defence of a part in a  
common war fhould not be a common charge, as well as thofe incurred profefledly  
for the general defence. ‘The defence of each part is that of the whole ; and unlefs all  
the expenditures are brought into a common mafs, the tendency mutt be, to add to  
the calamities fullered, by being the molt expofed tu the ravages of war, an increafe  
of burthens.  
  
This plan feems to he fufceptible of no objeAion, which does not belong to every  
other, that proceeds on the idea of a final adjument of accounts. The dithculty of  
fettling a ratio, is common to all, This mutt, probably, either be fought for in pro-  
portions of the requifitions, during the war, or ia the decilion of commifhoners ap-  
pointed with plenary power. ‘The rule preferibed in the conilitution, with regard  
to reprefentation and direct taxes, would evidently not be applicable to the fituation  
of parties, during the period in queftion.  
  
he exifting debt of the united Mates is excluded from the computation, as it ought  
to be, becaufe it will be providedfor out of a general fund.  
  
The only difcuffion of a preliminary kind, which remains, relates to the diftinc-  
tions of the debt into principal and intereft. It is well known, that the arrears of the  
latter bear a large proportion to the amount of the former. ‘The immediate payment  
of thefe arrears is evidently impracticable, and a queftion arifes, what ought to be  
dove with thenr?  
  
There is good reafon to conclude, that the impreflions of many are more favourable  
tw the claim of the principal than to thatof the iatereft; at lealt fo far as to pro-  
duce an opinion, that an inferior provifion might fuffice for the latter.  
  
But to the fecretary, this opinion does not appear well founded. His inveftigations  
of the fubject have led him to a conclufion, that the arrears of intereft have preten-  
fions, at leaft equal to the principal.  
  
The liquidated debt, traced to its origin, falls under two principal difcriminations.  
One, relating to loans; the other, to fervices performed and articles fupplied.  
  
The part arifing from hoans, was at firit made payable at fixed periods, which have  
long fince clapfed, with an early option to lenders, either to rec¢ive back their money  
at the expiration of thofe periods, or to continue it at intereft, ‘till the whole amount  
of cuntinental bills circulating fhould not exceed the fum in circulation at the time of  
each loan. ‘This contingency, in the fenie of the contraéi, never happened; and the  
prefumption is, that the creditors preferred continuing their moacy indefinitely at in-  
tereft, to receiving it in a depreciated and depreciating flate.  
  
The other parts of it were chiefly for objects which ought te have been paid for at  
the time, that is, when the fervices were performed, or the fupplies furnifhed; and  
were not accompanied with any contract for interett.  
  
But by different aéts of government and adminiftration, concurred in by the credi-  
tors, thefe parts of the debt have been converted into a capital, bearing an intereft of  
fix per cent. per annum, but without any definite period of redemption. A portion  
of the lean-office debt has been exchanged for new fecurities of that import. And  
the whole of itfeems to have acquired that character, alter the expiration of the pe-  
rieds prefixed for re-payment.  
  
if this view of the fubject be a juft one, the capital of the debt of the united fates,  
may be confidered in the light of an annuity at the rate of fix per cent. per annum,  
redeemable at the pleafure of the government, by payment of the principal. For it  
ems to be a clear pofition, that when a public contracts a debt payable with interef,

without any preeife time being ftipulated orunderftood for payment of the capital, thas  
rime is a matter of pure diferetion with the government, which is at liberty to confule  
its own convenience refpeAing it, taking care to pay the intereft with pun@tuality,  
  
Wherefore, as long as the united Rates fhould pay the intereft of their debt, as it ac.  
crued, their creditors would have no right to demand the principal.  
  
But with regard to the arrears of intereft, the cafe is different. Thefe are now  
duc, and thofe to whom they are due, have a right to claim immediate payment. ‘To  
fay, that it would be impraticable to comply, would not vary the nature of the right.  
Nor can this idea of impracticability be honorably carried further than to juftify the  
propoiition of a new contract, upon the bafis of a commutation of that right for ane-  
quivalent. ‘his equivalent too ought to be a realand fair one. And what other  
fair equivalent can be imagined for the detention ef money, but a reafonable intereft?  
@r what can be the flandard of thar intereft, but the market rate, or the rate which  
the government pays in ordinary cafes ?  
  
From this view of the matter, which appears to be the accurate and true one, it  
will follow, that the arrears of intereft are entitled to an equal provifion with the  
princip il of the debt.  
  
The refult of the foregoing difcuffions is this—That there ought to be no difcrim-  
ination between the original holders of the debt, and prefent poifleffors by purchafe—  
‘hat it is expedient, there fhould be an affumption of the ftate debts by the union,  
and that the arrears of intereft fhould be provided for, on an equal footing with the  
principal.  
  
‘The next enquiry, in order, towards determining the nature of a proper provifion,  
refpeAsthe quantum of the debt, and the prefent rates of interett.  
  
The debt of the union is diftinguithable into foreign and domeftic. Dol. Cents.  
  
The foreign debt amounts to principal hearing an intereft of four,  
  
and partly an intereft of five percent, - - 10,070,307.  
  
Arrears of interelt to the lait of December, 1789, 1,640,071. 62  
  
Making together, dollars 11,710,378. 62  
The domeftic debt may be fub-divided into liquidated and unli-  
quidated ; principal and interett.  
  
The principal of the liquidated part, amounts to 27,383,919. 74  
bearing an intereft of fix per cent.  
  
The arrears of intereR to the end of 1790, amount to 13,030,168. 20  
  
Making together, dollars 40;414,085. 94  
  
This includes all that has been paid in indents (except what has come into the tre  
fury of the united ftates) which, in the opinion of the feeretary, can be confidered ia  
mo other light, than as intereft due.  
  
The unliquidated part of the domeftic debt, which confifts chiefly of the eontinen-  
tal bills of credit, is not afcertained, but may be eftimated at 2,000,000 dollars,  
  
Thefe feveral fums conftitute the whole of the debt of the united ftates, amounting  
together to 54,124,464 dollars, and 56 cents.  
  
That of the individual ftates is not equally well afcertained. ‘The fecretary, how-  
ever, prefumes, that the total amount may be fafely ftated at 25 millions of dollars,  
principal and intereft. The prefent rate of intereft of the ftate debts is, in general,  
the fame with that of the domeftic debt of the union.  
  
On the foppofition, that the arrears of intereft ought to be provided for, on the  
the fame terims with the principal, the annual amount of the intereft, which, at the  
exifting rates, would be payable on the entire mafs of the public debt, would be,  
  
On the foreign debt, computing the intereft on the principal, as Dol. Cents.  
it ftands, and allowing four per cent. on the arrears of intereft, 542,599 66  
  
On the domettic debt, including that of the fates, - 4,044,345. 15

Making together, dollars 4,587,444. 81  
  
The interefting problem now occurs. Is it in the power of the united ftates, coa-  
fiftently with thofe prudential confiderations, which ought not to be overlooked, t  
make a provifion equal to the purpofe of funding the whole debt, at the rates of it-  
  
tereft which it now bears, in addition to the fum which will be neceffary for the cu  
rent fervice of the government ?

The fecretary will not fay that fuch a provifion would exceed the abilities of the  
country ; but he is clearly of opinion, that to make it, would require the extenfion of  
taxation to a degree, and to objects, which the true intereft of the public creditors for-  
bids. It is therefore to be hoped, and even to be expected, that they will cheerfully  
concur in fuch modifications of their claims, on fair and equitable principles, as will  
facilitate to the government an arrangement fubftantial, durable, and fatisfactory to the  
community. The importance of the laft characteriftic will itrike every difcerning  
pind. No plan, however flattering in appearance, to which it did mot belong, could  
be truly entitled to confidence.  
  
it will not be forgotten, that exigencies may, ere long, arife, which would call for  
refources greatly beyond what are now deemed fufficient for the current fervice; and  
that, fhould the faculties of the country be exbaulted, or even rained, to provide for  
the public debt, there could be lefs reliance on the facrednefs of the provition.  
  
But while the fecretary yiekis tothe force of thefe confiderations, he does not lofe  
fight of thofe fundamental principles of good faith, which dictate, thar every pratti-  
cable exertion ought to be made, {crupuloufly to fulfil the engagements of yovernment;  
that no change in the rights of its creditors ought to be attempted without their volun-  
tary confent; and that this confent ought to he voluntary in fact, as well as in name.  
Confequently, that every propofal of a change ought to be in the fhape of an appeal  
to their reafon and to their intercft; not to their neceflities. ‘To thisend it is requi-  
fite, that a fair equivalent fhould be offered for what may be afked to be given up,  
and unquettionabls fecurity for the remainder. Without this, an alteration, coniil-  
tently with the credit and honor of the nation, would be impracticable.  
  
It remains to fee, what can be propofed in conformity to thefe views.  
  
In has been remarked, that the capital of the debt of the unioa is to be viewed ia  
the light of an annuity at the rate of fix per cent. per annum, redeemable at the plea-  
fure of the government, by payment of the principal. And it will not be required,  
that the arrears of intereft fhould be confidered in a more favourable light. The fame  
character, in general, may be applied to the debts of the individual fates.  
  
This view of the fubje&amp; admits, that the united {tates would have it in their power  
to avail themfelves of any fall in the market rate of intereft, for reducing that of the  
debt.  
  
This property of the debt is favourable to the public; unfavourable to the creditor;  
and may facilitate an arrangement for the reduction of intercit, upon the bafis of a  
fair equivalent.  
  
Probabilities are always a rational ground of contrat. ‘The feeretary conceives,  
that there is good reafon to believe, if effectual meafures are taken to eftablith public  
credit, that the government rate of intere/t in the united ftates, will,in a very fhore  
time, fall at leaft as low as five per cent.: and that in a period not exceeding twenty  
ycars, it will fink ftill lower, probably to four.  
  
There are two principal caufes which will be likely to produce this effe&amp;; one, the  
low rate of intereft in Europe ; the other, the increafe of the monied capital of the  
nation, by the funding of the public debt.  
  
From three to four per cent. is deemed good intere(t in feveral parts ef Europe.  
Even lefs is deemed fo, in fome places. And it is on the decline; the increafing  
plenty of money continually tending to lower it. It is prefumable, that no country  
will be able to borrow of foreigners upon better terms, than the united ftates, becaule  
none can, perhaps, afford fo good fecurity. Our fituation expoles us lefs than that of  
any other nation, te thofe cafualties whichare the chief caules of expence ; our incum-  
branees, in proportion to our real means, are lefs, though thele cannot immediately be  
brought fo readily into action, and our progrefs in refources from the early late of the  
country, and the immenfe tracts of unfettled territory, mult neceflarily exceed chat of  
any other. ‘The advantages of this fituation have already engaged the attention of  
the European money-lenders, particularly among the Dutch. And as they become  
better underftood, they will have the greater influence. Hence as large a propor-  
tion of the cath of Europe as may be wanted, will be, in a certain fenfe, im our mare  
  
ket, for the ufe of government. And this will naturally have the effe&amp; ef a reduc-  
  
a. &amp;  
  
és  
tion of the rate of intereft, not indeed to the level of the places which fend their me-  
ey to market, but to fomething much nearer to it than our prefent rate.  
  
The influence which the funding of the debt is calculated to have, in lowering in-  
tereft, has been already remarked and cxplaincd. Itis hardly poflible, that it thould

not be materially affe&amp;ed by fuch an increafe of the monied capital of the nation, as  
would reiult from the proper funding of feventy millions of dollars. But the proba.  
bility of a decreafe in the rate of intereft, acquires confirmation from facis, which  
exifted prior to the revolution. It is well known, that in fome of the flates, Money  
might with facility be borrowed, on good fecurity, at five per cent. and, not unfre.  
quently, even at lefs.  
  
The mot enlightened of the public creditors will be moft fenfible of the juftnefs of  
this view of the fubje@, and of the propricty of the ufe which will be made of it,  
  
Vhe fecretary, in purfuance of it, will aflume, as a probability, fuficiently great to  
be a ground of calculation, both on the part of government and of its creditors—T ha,  
the intereft of money in the united flates will, 1m five years, fall to five per cent. and,  
intwenty, to four, The probability, in the mind of the fecretary, is rather that the  
fall may be more rapid and more confiderable ; but he prefers a mean, as moft likely  
to engage the aflent of the creditors, and more equitable in itfelf ; becaufe it is pre-  
dicated on probabilities, which may err on one fide, as well as on the other.  
  
Premifing thefe things, the fecretary fubmits to the houfe, the expediency of pro.  
poling a loan to the full amount of the debt, as weil of the particular fates, as of the  
union, upon the following terms.  
  
Firh—That for every hundred dollars fubferibed, payable in the debt (as well in-  
tereit as principal) the tubferiber be entitled, at his option, either  
  
‘Vo have two thirds funded at an annuity, or yearly intereft of fix per cent, redeem.  
able at the plealure of the government, by payment of the principal ; and to re  
ceive the ether third in lands in the Weitern Territory, at the rate of twenty cents per  
acre. Or,  
  
To have the whole fum funded at an annuity or yearly intereft of four per cent. ir-  
redeemable by any payment exceeding five dollars per annum on account both of pris  
cipal and intereft ; and to receive, as a compenfation for the reduction of interett, fil  
teen dollars and eighty cents, payable in lands, as in the preceding cafe. Or,  
  
To have fixty-fix dollars and two thirds ef a dollar funded immediately at an an  
nuity or yearly intereft of fix per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding four  
dollars and two thirds of a dollar per annum, on account both of principal and inter  
eft; and to have, at the end of ten years, twenty-fix dollars and eighty-eighty cents,  
funded at the like intercft and rate of redemption. Or,  
  
To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the contingency of living tos  
given age, not lefs diflant than ten years, computing intereft at four percent. Or,  
  
To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the contingency of the fur  
vivorfhip of the youngeft of two perfons, computing interefk, in this cafe alfo, at four  
per cent.  
  
In addition to the foregoing loan, payable wholly in the debt, the fecretary would  
propofe, that one fhould be opened for ten millions of dollars, on the following plan.  
  
That for every hundred dollars fubfcribed, payable one half in fpecie, and the other  
half in debt (as well principal as intereft) the fubfcriber be entitled to an annuity of  
yearly intereft of five per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding fix dollars per  
annum, on account both of principal and intereft.  
  
‘The principles and operation of thede different plans may now require explanatioo  
  
The firft is fimply a propofition fer paying one third of the debt in land, and fund  
ing the other two thirds, at the exitling rate of intereft, and upon the fame termsel  
redemption to which it is at prefent fubje@.  
  
Here is no conjeGure, no calculation of probabilities The creditor is offered th  
advantage of making his intereft principal, and he is afked to facilitate to the gover-  
ment an effeCual provifion for his demands, by accepting a third part of them ia  
land, at a fair valuation.  
  
The general price, at which the weftern lands have been, heretofore, fold, has been  
a dollar per acre in public fecurities; but at the time the principal purchafes were  
made, thefe fecurities were worth, in market, lefs than three fhillings in the pound.  
The nominal price, therefore, would not be the proper ftandard, under prefent cit  
cumftances, nor would the precife fpecie value then given, be a juft rule. Becaufe,  
the payments were to be made by inftalments, and the fecurities were, at the times  
the purchafes, extremely low, the probability of a moderate rife muft be prefumed t  
have been taken into the account. Twenty cents, therefore, feem to bear an equitablé  
proportion to the two confiderations of value at the time, and likelihood of inereale.

It will be underftood, that upon this plan, the public retains the advantage of avail-  
ing itfelf of any fall in the market rate of intereft, for reducing that upon the debt,  
which is perfectly jut, as no prefent facrifice, either in the quantum of the principal,  
or in the rate of intereft, is required from the creditor.  
  
The inducement to the mealure is, the payment of one third of the debt in land.  
  
The fecond plan is grounded upon the fuppofition, that intereft, in five years, will  
fall to five per cent. 1 fifteen more, to four. As the capital remains entire, but bear-  
ing an intereft of four per cent. only, compenfation is to be made to the creditor, for  
the intereft of two per cent. per annum for five years, and of one per cent. per annum,  
for ifteen years, to commence at the diftance of five years. The prefent value of thefe  
two {ums or annuities, computed according to the terms of the fuppofition, is, by ftriét  
calculation, fifteen dollars and feven hundred and ninéty-two thoufandth parts of a  
dollar ; a fraction lefs than the fum propofed.  
  
The inducement tothe meafure here is, the reduction of intereft, to a rate more  
within the compafs of a convenient provifion ; and the payment of the compenfation  
in lands.  
  
The inducements tothe individual are—the accommodation afforded to the pub-  
lic—the high probability of a complete equivalent—the chance even of gain, thould  
the rate of intereft fall, either more {peedily or in a greater degree than the calcula-  
tion fuppofes: Should it fall to five per cent. fooner than five years; fhould it fall  
lower than five before the additional fifteen were expired ; or fhould it fall below  
four, previous te the payment of the debt, there would be, in each cafe, am abfolute  
profit to the creditor. As his capital will remain entire, the valwe of it will increafe,  
with every decreafe of the rate of intcrett.  
  
The third plan proceeds upon the like fuppofition of a fucceffive fall in the rate of  
intere. And upon that fuppofition offers an equivalent to the creditor. One hun-  
dred dollars, bearing an intereft of fix per cent. for five years; of five per cent. for  
fifteen years, and thenceforth of four per cent. (thefe being the fucceffive rates of is-  
tereit in the market) is equal to a capital of 122 dollars, 510725 parts,  
  
bearing an intercit of four per cent. which, converted into a ¢apital, bearing a fixed  
rate of intereft of fix per cent. is equal to 8x dollars, 6733166 parts.  
  
The difference between fixty-fix dollars and two thirds of a dollar (the fum to be  
funded immediately) and this laf fum is 15 dollars, Of72 parts,  
which, at fix percent. per annum,amounts at the end of ten yearsto 26 dol. 8755 parts,  
the fum to be funded at the expiration of that period  
  
It ought, however, to be acknowledged, that this calculation does not make allow-  
ance for the principle of redemption, which the plan itfelf includes; upon which prift-  
ciple the equivalent in a capital of fix per cent. would be by ftrict calculation,  
  
87 dollars, 50766 parts.  
  
But there are two confiderations which induce the fecretary to think, that the on.  
propofed would operate more equitably than this: One is, that it may not be very  
early in the power of the united ftates to avail themfelves of the right of redemption  
referved in the plan : The other is, that with regard to the part to be funded at the  
end of ten years, the principle of redemption is fufpended during that time, and the  
full intereft at fix per cent. goes on improving at the fame rate; which forthe Ju? Ave  
  
years will exceed the market rate of intereft, according to the fuppofition.  
  
The equivalent is regulated in this plan, by the circumflance of fixing the rate of  
intereft higher, than it is fuppofed it will continue to be in the market ; permirting  
only a gradual difcharge of the debt, in an eftablithed proportion, and confequently  
preventing advantage being taken of any decreafe of intere(t below the {tipulated rate.  
  
Thus the true value of eighty-one deilars and fixty-feven cents, the capital,propof-  
ed, confidered as a perpetuity, and bearing fix per cent. intereft, when the market rate  
of intereft was five per cent. would be a fail fraction more than nipety-cight dol-  
lars, when it was four per cent. would be one hundred and twenty-two dollars and  
fifty-one cents. But the propof€d capital being fubjedt to a gradual redemption, it is  
evident, that its value, in each cafe, would be fomewhat lefs. Yet from this may be  
perceived, the manner in which a Jefs capital, at a fixed rate of intereft, becomesan e-  
Snivalent for a greater capital, at a rate liable to variation and diminution.  
  
It is prefumable, that thofe creditors, who do not entertain a favourable opinion of  
property in weitern lands, will give a preference to this laft mode of modelling the  
debt. The fecretary is fincere in affirming, that, in his opinion, it will be likely te

prove, te ihe full as beneficial to the creditor, asa provifion for his debt upon its prefent  
terms,  
  
it is not intended, jn cither cafe,to oblige the government to redeem, in the propor-  
tion {pecified, but to fecure to it the right of doing fo, to avoid the inconvenience of a  
perpetuity.  
  
The fourth and fifth plans abandon the fuppofition which isthe bafis of the two pre.  
ceding ones, and offer only four per cent. throughout.  
  
‘The reafon of this is, that the payment being deferred, there will be an accumula.  
tion of compound intereft,in the intermediate period, againft the public, which, with.  
out a very provident adminiflration, would turn to its detriment, And the fufpen.  
fion of the burthen would be too apt to beget a relaxation of efforts in the mean time,  
‘The meafure therefore, its obje&amp; being temporary accommodation, could only be ad-  
vifable upon a moderate rate of interett.  
  
With regard to individuals, the inducement will be fufficient at four per cent,  
There isno difpefition of money, in private loans, making allowance for the ufual  
delays and cafualties, which would be equally beneficial as a future provifion.  
  
A hundred dollars advanced upon the life of a perfon of eleven years old, would  
produce an annuity, Dol. Paris,  
  
If commencing at twenty-one, of IO 346  
If commencing at thirty-one, of 18 80;  
If commencing at forty-one, of 25  
if commencing at fifty-one, of - - 78 580  
  
The fame fum advanced upen the chance of the furvivorfhip of the youngeit of two  
lives, one of the perfons heing twenty-five, the other thirty years old, would produce,  
if the youngeft of the two fhould furvive, an annuity for the remain-  
  
der of life of 25 dol. 556 parts.  
  
From thefe inflances may readily he difcerned, the advantages which thefe defer-  
red annuities afford, for fecuring a comfortable provifion for the evening of life, or for  
wives who furvive their hufbands.  
  
The fixth plan alfo relinquifhes the fuppofition, which is the foundation of the &amp;-  
cond and third, and offers a higher rate of intereft upon fimilar terms of redemption,  
for the confideration of the payment of one balf of the loan in fpecie. This isa plan  
highly advantageous to the creditors, who may be able to make that payment; whik  
the fpecie itfelf could be applied in purchafes of the debt, upon terms which would  
fully indemnily the public for the increafed intereft.  
  
It is not improbable, that foreign holders of the domeftic debt, may embrace this  
asa defirabic arrangement.  
  
As an auxiliary expedient, and by way of experiment, the fecretary would propolt  
a loan upon the principles of a tontine,  
  
‘To confilt of fix clafies, compofed refpectively of perfons of the following ages ;

which thefe circumftances prefent, the ceffation of the right of furvivorfhip on the  
death of four-fifths of the annuitants, will be no inconfiderable addition.  
  
The inducements to individuals are, a competent intereft for their money from the  
outfet, fecured for life, and the profpect of continual increafe, and even of large profit  
to thefe, whofe fortune it is to furvive their affociates.  
  
It will have appeared, that in all the propofed loans, the fecretary has contemplated  
the putting the intereit upon the fame footing with the principal : That on the debt  
of the united ftates, he would have computed to the latt of the prefent year : Téa? on  
the debt of the particular ftates, to the lait of the year 1791; the reafon for which dif-  
tinction will be feen hereafter.  
  
In order to keep up a due circulation of money, it will be expedient, that the intereft  
of the debt thould be paid quarter-ycarly. This regulation will, at the fame time,  
conduce to the advantage of the public creditors, giving them, in fad, by the antici-  
pation of payment, a higher rate of intereft ; which may, with propricty, be taken in-  
to the eftimate of the compenfation to be made to them. ix per cent. per annum,  
paid in this mode, will truly be worth fix dollars, and one handred and thirty-five  
thoufandth parts of a dollar, computing the market intere{t at the fame rate.  
  
The fecretary thinks it advifable, to hold out various propofitions, all of them com-  
patible with the public intereft, becaufeit is, in his opinion, of the greateft confequence  
thatthe debt fhould,with the confent of the creditors, be re-moulded into fuch a thape,  
as will bring the expenditure of the nation to a level with its income. &quot;Till this thall  
be accomplifhed, the finances of the united ftates will never wear a proper counte-  
nance, Arrears of intereft, continually accruing, will be as continual a monument,  
either of inability, or of ill faith ; and will not ceafe to have an evil influence on pub-  
lic credit. Innothing are appearances of greater moment, than in whatever regards  
credit Opinion isthe fou! of it, and this is affe¢ted by appearances, as well as realities.  
By offering an option to the creditors, between a number of plans, the change medi-  
tated will be more likely to be accomplifhed, Different tempers will be governed by  
different views of the fubject.  
  
But while the fecretary would endeavour to effe&amp; a change in the form of the debt,  
by new loans, in order to render it more fufceptible of an adequate provifion; he would  
not think it proper to aim at procuring the concurrence of the creditors by operating  
upon their neceffities.  
  
Hence whatever furplus of revenue might rema&#x27;n, after fatisfying the intereft of  
the new loans, and the demand for the current fervice, ought to be divided among  
thofe creditors, if any, who may not think fit to fubfcribe to them. But for this pur-  
pofe, under the circumftance of depending propolitions, a temporary appropriation  
will be moft advifable, and the fum mutt be limited to four per cent. as the revenues  
will only be calculated to produce, in that proportion to the entire debt.  
  
The fecretary confides for the fuccefs of the propofitions, to be made, on the good-  
nefs of the reafons upon which they ‘reft ; on the fairnefs of the equivalent to be offer-  
ed in each cafe; on the difcernment of the creditors of their true igtereft ; and on  
their difpofition tu facilitate the arrangements of the government, and to render them  
fatisfaory to the community.  
  
The remaining part of the tafk to be performed is, to take a view of the means of  
providing for the debt, according to the modification of it, which is propofed.  
  
On this point the fecretary premifes, chat in his opinion, the funds to be eflablifhed,  
ought, for the prefent, to be confined to the exilting debt of the united fates; as well,  
becaufe a progreffive augmentation of the revenue will be molt convenient, as becaufe  
the confent of the ftate creditors is neceffary to the affumptiow contemplated; and  
though the obtaining of that confent may he inferred with great affurance, from their  
obvious intereft to give it; yet ‘till it fhall be obtained, an aGual provifion for the  
debt would be premature. ‘Taxes could not, with propriety, be laid, for an object  
which depended on fuch a contingency.  
  
All that ought now to be done, refpecting it, is, to put the matter in an effectual  
train for a future provifion. For which purpofc, the fecretary will, in the courfe of  
this report, fubmit fuch propofitions, as appear to him advifable.  
  
The fecretary now proceeds to a confideration of the neceffary funds.  
  
It has been ftated that the debt of the united ftates confilts of  
  
Dollars. Cents,  
The foreign debt, amounting, with arrears of intereft, to 11,710,378. 62  
  
  
  
—  
  
  
  
204 Political Regifter.  
  
And the domeftic debt, amounting, with like arrears, comput-  
ed to the end of the year 1790, to 42,414.08 5.  
Making together, Dollars 54,124,464. &lt;6  
The intereft on the domeftic debt is computed to the end of this year, becaufe the  
details of carrying any plan into execution, will exhauft the year. Dol. Cents,  
The annual intereft of the foreign debt has been fated at 542,599+ 66  
And the iacercft on the domettic debt, at four per cent. would a-  
mount to 1,596,563.° 43  
  
~~  
  
Making together, Dullars, 2,239,163. og  
  
Thus to pay the intereft of the foreign debt, and to pay four per cent. on the whole  
of the demeftic debt, principal and intereft, forming a new ca-  
  
pital, will require a yearly income of 2,239,163 Dol. 9 Cent;,  
  
‘Lhe fum which, in the opinion of the fecretary, ought now to be provided in addi.  
- to what the current fervice will require,  
  
For, though the rate of intereft, propofed by the third plan, exceeds four per cent,  
on the whole debt, and the annuities on the tontine will alfo exceed four per cent. on  
the jums which may be fubfcribed ; yet, as the actual provifien for a part is, in the  
former cafe, fufpended; as meafures for reducing the debt, by purchafes, may be ad-  
vantageoully purfucd, and as the payment of the deferred annuities will of courle be  
pottponed, four per cent. on the whole will be a fufficient provilion.  
  
With regard to the inflalments of the foreign debt, thefe, inthe opinion of the fe  
cretary, ought to be paid by new loans abroad. Could funds be conveniently fpared,  
from oth er exigencies, for paying them, the united ftates could ill bear the drain of  
cafh, at the prefent juncture, which the meafure would be likely to occafion.  
  
But to the fum which has been ftated for payment of the intereft, mutt be added a  
provifion for the current fervice. This the fecretary etlimates at fix hundred thow-  
fand dollars; making with the amount of the intereft, two millions, eight hundred  
and thirty-nine thoufand, one hundred and fixty-three doliars, and nine cents.  
  
‘This fum may, in the opinion of the fecretary, be obtained from the prefent duties  
on imports and tonnage, with the additions, which, withoutany poflible difadvantage  
either to trade or agriculture, may be made on wines, fpirits, including thofe diltilled  
within the united ftates, teas, and coffee.  
  
The fecretary conceives, that it will be found policy, to carry the duties upon arti-  
cles of this kind, as high aswill be confifient with the practicability of a fafe collection,  
This will leffen the neceflity, both of having recourie to dire&amp; taxation, and of ac:  
cumulating duties where they would be more inconvenient to trade, and upon objeds  
which are more to be regarded as neceflaries of life.  
  
That the articles which have been enumerated, will, better than moft others, bear  
high duties, can hardly be a queftion. ‘They are all of them, in reality—luxuries—  
the greateft part of them forcign luxuries; fome of them, im the excefs in which they  
are ufed, pernicious luxuries. And there is, perhaps, none of them, which is not con-  
fumed in fo great abundance, as may jultly denominate it a fource of national ex-  
travegance and impoverifhment. ‘Ihe confumption of ardent {pirits particularly, no  
doubt very much on account of their cheapnefs, is carried to an extreme, which 6  
truly to be regretted, as well in regard to the heaith and the morals, as to the econo  
my of the community.  
  
Should the increafe of duties tend to a decreafe of the confumption of thofe articles,  
the effect would be, inevery refpe&amp; defirable. ‘The faving which it would occafion,  
would leave individuals more at their cafe, and promote a more favourable balance el  
trade. Asfar as this decreafe might be applicable to diftilled fpirits, it would encouw  
rage the fubflitution of cyder and malt liquors, benefit agriculture, and open anew and  
productive fource of revenue,  
  
It is not however, probable, that this decreafe would be in a degree, which would  
fruftrate the expecied benefit to the revenue from raifing the duties. Experience has  
fhewn, that luxurics of every kind lay the ftrongeft hold on the attachments of man-  
kind, which, efpecial!y when confirmed by habit, are not cafily alienated from them.  
  
The fame fac&amp; affords a fecurity to the merchant, that he is not likely to be preji-  
diced by confidcrable duties on fuch articles, They will ulually command a propo

tional price. The chief things im this view to be attended to, afe, that the terms of  
ayment be fo regulated, as not to require inconvenient advances, and that the mode  
of collection be fecure.  
  
To other reafons, which plead for carrying the duties upon the articles which have  
been mentioned, to as great an extent as they will bear, may be added thefe ; that  
they are of a nature, from their extenfive confumption, to be very produ@tive, and  
are amongft the moft difficult ojedts of illicit introduction.  
  
Invited by fo many motives to make the beft ufe of the refource, which thefe arti-  
cles afford, the effential enquiry is—in what mode can the duties upon them be moft  
effeually collected ?  
  
With regard to fuch of them as will be brought from abroad, a duty on importa-  
tion recommends itfelf by two leading confiderations; one is, that meeting the ob-  
jet at its firft entrance into the country, the collection is drawn toa point, and fo far  
fimplified ; the other is, that it avoids the poflibility of interference between the re-  
gulations of the united ttates, and thofe of the particular fates.  
  
But a duty, the precautions for the collection of which fhould terminate with the  
landing of the goods, as is effentially the cafe in the exifting fyftem, could not, with  
fafety, be carried to the extent which is contemplated.  
  
In that fyftem, the evafion of the duties, depends as it were, on a fingle rik. To  
land the goods in defiance of the vigidance of the officers of the cuftoms, is almoft  
the fole difficulty. No future purfuit is materially to be apprehended. And where the  
inducement is equivalent to the rifk, there will be found too many,who are willing to  
run it. Confequently there will be extenfive frauds of the revenue, againft which the  
utmoft rigor of penal laws has proved, as often as it has been tried, an ineffectual guard.  
  
The only expedient which has been difcovered, for conciliating high duties with a  
fafe collection, is, the eftablifhment of a fecond, or interior fcrutiny.  
  
By purfuing the article, from its importation, into the hands of the dealers in it,  
the rik of the detection is fo greatly enhanced, that few, in comparifon, will venture  
to incur it. Indeed every dealer, who is not himéelf the fraudulent importer, then  
becomes, in fome fort, a centinel upon him,  
  
The introduction of a fyftem, founded on this principle, in fome fhape or other, is,  
in the opinion of the fecretary, effential tothe efficacy of every attempt, to render  
the revenues of the united ftates equal to their exigencies, their fafety, their profperi-  
ty, their honour.  
  
Nor is it lefs effential to the intereft of the honcft and fair trader. It might even  
be added, that every individual citizen, befides his fhare in the general weal, has a  
particular intereft in it. The practice of fmuggling never fails to have one of two  
effects, and fometimes unites them both. Either the {mugyler underfeils the fair tra-  
der, as, by faving the duty, he can afford to do, and makes it a charge upon him; or  
he fells at the increafed price occafioned by the duty, and defrauds every man, who  
buys of him, of his thare of what the public ought toreceive. For it is evident, that  
the lofs falls ultimately upon the citizens, who mott be charged with other taxes to  
make good the deficiency, and fupply the wants of the fate.  
  
The fecretary will not prefume, that the plan which he thali fubmit to the confi-  
deration of the houfe, is the beft that could be devifed. But it is the one, which has  
appeared to him freeft from objedtions of any that has occurred of equal efficacy.  
He acknowledges too, that it is fuiceptible of improvement, by other precautions in  
favor of the revenue, which he did not think it expedient to add. The chief outlines  
of the plan are not origiaal, but it isno ill recommendation of it, that it has been  
tried with fuccefs.  
  
The fecretary accordingly propofes,  
  
That the duties heretofore laid upon wines, diftilled fpirits, teas, and coffee, fhould,  
a lat day of May next, ceafe, and that inftead of them, the following duties  
ie laid —  
  
( Here follows an enumeration of propofed duties on wines, diflilled /pirits, coffee, and teas ;  
end a reference to the draft of a bill for colledting the fame, which was annexed to the report.  
A detatl of this part of the report dees not now feem intercfling, and is therefore omitted. )  
  
It would be the intentivn of the fecretary, that the duty on wines fheuld be collect-  
ed upon precifely the fame plan with that on imported fpirits.  
  
But with regard to teas and coffee, the fecretary is inclined to think, that it will  
be expedient, till expesience fhall evince the propriety of going further, to exclude  
  
  
  
206 Political Regifter.  
  
the ordinary right of the officers to vifit and infpe&amp; the places in which thofe articles  
may be kept. The other precautions, without this, will afford, though not complete,  
confiderable fecurity.  
  
It will not efeape the obfervation of the houfe, that the fecretary, in the plan fub.  
mitted, has taken the moft [crupulous care, that thofe citizens upon whom it is imme.  
diately to operate, be fecured from every fpecies of injury by the mifcondué of the  
officers to be employed. There are not only ftrong guards again their being guilty  
of abufes of authority ; they are not only punifhable, criminally, for any they may  
commit, and made anfwerable in damages, to individuals, for whatever prejudice  
thefe may fullain by their acts or neyle&amp;s: But even where feizures are made with  
probable caufe, if there be an acquittal of the article feized, a compenfation to the  
proprictors for the injury their property may fuffer, and even for its detention, is to  
he made out of the public treafury.  
  
So folicitous indeed has the fecretary been, to obviate every appearance of hardthip,  
that he has even included a compenfation to the dealers, for their agency in aid of  
the revenue.  
  
With all thefe precautions to manifeft a fpirit of moderation and juftice on the part  
of the government : And when it is confidered, thatthe obje&amp; of the propofed fyf-  
tem isthe firm eftablifhment of public credit; that on this depends the character, fe-  
curity, and profperity of the nation; that advantages in every light important, may  
be expected to refult from it; that the immediate operation of it will be upon an en-  
lightened clafs of citizens, zealoufly devoted to good government, and to a liberal  
and enlarged policy, and that it is peculiarly the interelt of the virtuous part of them  
to co-operate in whatever will reftrain the fpirit of illicit traffic ; there will be per-  
ceived to exift the juitett ground of confidence, that the plan, if eligible in itfelf, will  
experience the cheerful and prompt acquiefcence of the community.  
  
The fecretary computes the nett product of the duties propoled in this report at a-  
bout one million feven hundred and three thoufand four hundred dollars, which, if  
near the truth, will, together with the probable produd of the duties on imports and  
tonnage, complete the fum required. But it will readily occur, that in fo unexplored  
a field there muft be a confiderable degree of uncertainty in the data. And that, oa  
this account, it will be prudent to have an auxiliary refource for the firft year, in  
which the intereft will become payable, that there may be no poflibility of difappoint-  
ment to the public creditors,ere there may be an opportunity of providing for any  
deficiency which the experiment may difcover. This will accordingly be attended  
to.  
  
The proper appropriation of the funds provided, and to be provided, feems next to  
offer itfelf to confideration.  
  
On this head, the fecretary would propofe, that the duties on diftilled fpirits, fhould  
be applied in the firft inflance, to the payment of the intereft of the foreign debt.  
  
‘That referving out of the refidue of thofe duties an annual fum of fix hundred thou  
fand dollars, for the current fervice of the united ftates; the furplus, together with  
the product of the other duties, be applied to the payment of the intereft on the new  
loan, by an appropriation, co-extenfive with the duration of the debt.  
  
And that if any part of the debt thould remain unfubferibed, the excefs of the re-  
venue be divided among the creditors of the unfubfcribed part, by a temporary dif  
pofition ; with a limitation, however, to four per cent.  
  
It will hardly have been unnoticed, that the fecretary has been thus far filent on  
the fubject of the poft-office. ‘he reafon is, that he has had in view the application  
of the revenue arifing from that fource, to the purpofes ef a finking fund. ‘The poll:  
mafter-general gives it as his opinion, that the immediate produ of it, upgn 4 pro  
per arrangement, would probably be, not lefs than one hundred thoufand dollars.  
And from its nature, with good management, it muft be a growing, and will be like-  
ly to become a confiderable fund. The poft-mafter-general is now engaged in pre  
paring a plan, which will be the foundation of a propofition for a new arrangement  
of the eftablifhment. This, and fome other points relative to the fubjeé referred 0  
the fecretary, he begs leave to referve for a future report.  
  
Perfuaded as the fecretary is, that the proper funding of the prefent debt, will ren-  
der it a national blefling : Yet he is fo far from acceding te the pofition, in the lat  
tude in which it is fometimes laid down, that “ public debts are public benefits,” 4  
poition inviting to prodigality, and liable to dangerous abufe,—that be ardently  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Political Regifter.  
  
withes to fee it incorporated, as a fundamental maxim, in the fyfiem of public credit  
  
207  
  
es of the united fates, that the creation of debt thould always be accompanied with the  
te, means of extinguifhment. ‘This he regards as the true fecret for rendering the public  
credit immortal, And he prefumes, that it is difficult to conceive a &amp;ituation, in  
ub. which there may not be an adherence tothe maxim. At lcatt he feels an unlcigned  
ne- folicitude, that this may be attempted by the united flates, and that they may come  
the mence their meafures for the eftablifhment of credit, with the oblerva ice of it.  
ilty Under this impreflion, the fecretary propoles, that the nett product of the poft-of-  
may fice, to afum not exceeding onc million of dollars, be vetted in commillioners, to con-  
dice fift of the vice-prefident of the united flates or prefident of the fenate, the fpeaker of  
vith the houfe of reprefentatives, the chief juftice, fecretary of the treafury, aud attorney-  
» the general of the united ftates, for the time being, in truft, to be applied, by them, or a-  
is to ny three of them, to the dilcharge of the exiting public debt, either by purchafes uf  
ftock in the market, or by payments on account of the principal, as thail appear to  
\fhip, them molt advifable, in conformity to the public engagements; to continue fo veit-  
id of ed until the whole of the debt fhall be difcharged.  
  
Asan additional expedient for effecting a reduction of the debt, and for other pur-  
¢ part pofes which will be mentioned, the fecretary would further propofe that the fame  
d fyf- commiflioners be authorifed, with the approbation of the prefident of the united itates,  
er, fe- to borrow, on their credit, a fum not exceeding twelve millions of dollars, to be ap-

vhich, if this part of the debt, after paying the inftalments which will accrue in the courfe of F  
orts and 1790, will be 3,888,888 dollars, and 81 cents  
explored Fourthly. ‘To the purchafe of the public debt at the price it fhall bear inthe mare  
that, oa ket, while it continues below its true value. ‘This meafure, which would be, in the  
year, opinion of the: fecretary, highly difhonorable to the government, if it were to pre-  
fappoint- cede a provifion for funding the debt, would become altogether unexceptionabie, after  
} for any that had been made. Its effect would be in favour of the public crediiors, as ic would  
attended tend to raife the value of ftock. And all the difference, between its true value and  
the actual price, would be fo much clear gain tothe public. ‘The payment of foreign  
18 next to intereft on the capital to be borrowed for this purpoie, fhould that be a necefl ary cone  
fequence, would not, in the judgment of the fecretary, be a good objection to the  
its, fhould meafure. The faving by the operation would be iticif a fuflicient indemnity ; and  
lebt. the employment of that capital, im a country fituated lke this, would much more  
ired thou- than compenfate for it. Befides, if the government does not undertake this operas  
ther with tion, the fame inconvenience which the objection in queition fuppofes, would h ppen  
n the new in another way, with a carcumitance of aggravation. As long, at jeait, as the debt  
thall continue below its proper value, it will be an object of {peculation to foreigners,  
of the if who will not only receive the intereft, upon what they purchafe, and remit it abroad,

208 Political Regifter.  
  
The fecretary now proceeds, in the laft place, to offer to the confideration of +},  
houfe, his ideas of the dteps, which ought, at the prefent feflion, to be taken, towards  
the aflumption of the ftate debts.  
  
Thefe are briefly, that concurrent refolutions of the two houfes, with the approba.  
tion of the prefident, be entered into, declaring in fubflance,  
  
‘That the united ftates do affume, and will at the firlt feflion in the year 1791, pro.  
vide, on the fame terms with the prefent debt of the united fates, for all fuch part of  
the debts ef the refpective ftates, or any of them, as fhall, prior to the firtt day of Ja-  
nuary, in the faid year 1791, be fubferibed towards a loan to the united fates, upon  
the principles of either of the plans, which fhail have been adopted by them, for ob.  
taining a re-loan of their prefent debt.  
  
Provided that the provifion to be made as aforefaid, fhall be fufpended, with refpeg  
to the debt of any ftate, which may have exchanged the fecurities of the united {lates  
for others iffued by itfelf, until the whole of the faid fecurities fhall, either be re-ey.  
changed, or furrendered to the united fates.  
  
Aud provided alfo, that the intereft upon the debt affumed be computed to the end  
of the year 1791; and that the intereft to be paid by the united fates, commence og  
the firit day of January, (792.  
  
‘That the amount of the debt of each ftate fo aflumed and provided for, be charged  
to fuch ftate in account with the united ftates, upon the fame principles upon  
which it fhall be lent to the united ilates.  
  
‘That fubicriptionsbe opened for receiving loans of the faid debts, at the fame time  
and places, and under the like regulations, as fhall have been prefcribed in relation »  
the debt of the united (lates.  
  
‘The fecretary has now completed the objects, which he propofed to himielf  
comprife in the prefent report. He has, for the molt part, omitted details, as well  
to avoid fatiguing the attention of the houfe, as becaufe more time would have been  
defirable even to digeft the general principles of the plan. If thefe thould be found  
right, the particular modifications will readily fuggeit themfelves in the pregrels of  
the work. |  
  
The feerctary, in the views which have directed his purfuit of the fubje&amp;, has been  
influenced, in the firft place, by the confideration, that his duty, from the very term  
of the refolution of the houfe, obliged him to propofe what appeared to him ap ai-  
equate provifion for the fupport of the public credit, adapted, at the fame time. to th  
real circamftances of the united fates; and in the next, by the refleétion, that me-  
fures which will not bear the teft of future unbiafled examination, can neither be pro-  
du&amp;ive of individual reputation, nor (which is of much greater conlequence ) public  
honour vr advantage.  
  
Deeply impreifed, as the fecretary is, with a full and deliberate conviGion, tha  
the ecitablifhment of public credit, upon the bafis of a fatisfaory provifion for th  
public debt, is, under the prefent circumftances of this country, the true defideratum  
towards retief from individual and national embarrailments ; that without it, thefe em-  
barraffments will be likely to prefs {till more feverely upon the community—He cae  
not but indulge an anxious with, that an effectual pian, for that purpofe, may, during  
the prefent fcflion, be the refult of the united wildom of the legiflature.  
  
He isfully convinced, that it is of the greateft importance, that no further delay  
fhould attend the making of the requifite provifion; not only, becaufe it wiil give 4 bet  
ter imprcflion of the good faith of the country, and will bring earlier relief to the at  
ditors; both which circumftances are of great moment to public credit : but, becaul  
the advantages to the community, from railing ftock, as {peedily as poflible, to its m  
tural value, will be incomparably greater than any that can refult from its continuance  
below that ttandard. No profit, which could be derived from purchaies in the market,  
on account of the government, to any practicable extent, would be an equivalent for  
the lofs which would be {eflained by the purchafes of foreigners, at a low vatue. Not  
to repeat, that governmental purchales, to be honorable, ought to be preceded by +  
provifion. Delay, by difleminating doubt, would fink the price of ftock ; and ast  
temptation to foreign fpeculations, from the lownefs of the price, would be too gre#  
to be neglected, millions would probably be lott to the united fates.  
  
All which is humbly fubmitted.

seems decisive on that question. At the close of the war  
  
that body addressed a circular to the States, where is the  
follow passage, which seems made for the occasion:  
The remaining class of creditors, say they, is compoe  
partly of our fellow citizens as originally lent to the  
public the use of their funds, or have since manifested most  
confidence in their country by receiving transfer for the  
lenders, and partly of those whose property has been

toms, or collected by direct taxation.  
  
The parallel that has been drawn  
between this measure and that of  
Hamilton in 1790 for assuming the  
debts of the States, is fallacious.  
Without stopping to consider how  
much, even if the parallel existed, the  
argument would prove, it is enough at  
present to show that it does not exist.  
  
The State debts then assumed had  
been incurred chiefly in the war of the  
Revolution, either in the general de-  
fence, or the defence of the particular  
State. Hamilton himself said, of both  
the State debts and the debts of the  
United States, “the objects for which  
both descriptions of the debt were con»  
tracted are in the main the same. In-  
deed, a_great part of the particular  
debts of the States has arisen from  
assumptions by them, on account of  
the Union. And it is most equitable  
that there should be the same measure  
of retribution to all.”  
  
There had been accounts of long  
standing between the Union and the  
States. These had yet to be settled  
on principles of equity, requiring great  
moderation. The debtsassumed were  
charged to the States in account with  
the Federal government, and even  
then it was supposed, that upon  
crediting them with all their expendi-  
tures during the war, there would  
appear balances in favor of all of them  
against the United States.

Senate and six in the House. This is the first  
instance on record of the practical operation of  
the doctrine of Instructions on Representatives in  
Congress, and it would have been fortunate for  
the Country if the effect produced by Instructions  
had always been as beneficial to the interests of  
the People as on this occasion. The doctrine,  
however, is a pornicious one, the evil conse.  
quences of which have been often felt; and, by  
those best competent to judge, it has been con­  
sidered contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.  
The amount of the debt of each State assumed  
and subscribed to the loan, was to be a charge  
against such State, in account with the United  
States. To complete a settlement of the accounts  
between the States and the United States, a board  
consisting of three Commissioners was established  
during this session, the decision of a majority of  
them to be final and conclusive. The balances  
found due to the States were to be funded on the  
same terms as the other parts of the Domestic  
debt; but were not to be transferable.  
A fund for sinking the national debt was estab.

The Secretary conceives that it will be sound policy to carry  
the duties upon articles of this kind, as high as will be con-  
sistent with the practicability of a safe collection. This  
will lessen the necessity both of having recourse to direct  
taxation, and of accumulating duties, when they would be  
more Inconvenient to trade, and upon objects which are  
more to be regarded as necessaries of life. That the articles  
which have been enumerated will, better than most others,  
bear high duties, can hardly bea question. ‘They are all of  
them in reality luxuries,—the greater part foreign luxuries.  
Some of them, in the excess in which they are used, are per-  
nicious luxuries, and there is perhaps none of them which is  
not consumed in so great abundance as may justly denomi-  
nate it a source of national extravagance and impoverish-  
ment.  
  
The consumption of ardent spirits particularly, no doubt,  
very much on account of the cheapness, is carried to an  
extreme which is truly to be regretted, as well in regard to  
health and morals, as to the economy of the community.&quot;

emanated from the distinguished Hamilton, to whom the country is so highly indebted  
for a complete system of finance and for his exertions to maintain state credit.  
  
To attempt to enumerate the complicated variety of mischiefs in the  
whole system of the social economy, which proceed from a neglect of the  
maxims that uphold public credit, and justify the solicitude manifested by  
the house on this point, would be an improper intrusion.  
  
If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly so important, the next  
inquiry which suggests itself is, By what means is it to be effected? The  
ready answer to which question is, by good faith ; by a punctual perfor-  
mance of contracts. States, like individuals, who observe their engage-  
ments, are respected and trusted; while the reverse is the fate of those who  
pursue an opposite conduct.

Every breach of the public engagements, whether from choice or neces-  
sity, is, in different degrees, hurtful to public credit. When such a neces-  
sity does truly exist, the evils of it are only to be palliated by a scrupulous  
attention, on the part of the government, to carry the violation no further  
than the necessity absolutely requires, and to manifest, if the nature of the  
case admit of it, a sincere disposition to make reparation whenever circum-  
stances shall permit. But, with every possible mitigation, credit must suf-  
fer, and numerous mischiefs ensue. It is, therefore, highly important,  
when an appearance of necessity seems to press upon the public councils,  
that they should examine well its reality, and be perfectly assured that there  
is no method of escaping from it, before they yield to ita suggestions. For,  
though it cannot safely be affirmed that occasions have never existed, or  
may not exist, in which violations of the public faith, in this respect, are in-  
evitable ; yet there is great reason to believe that they exist far less fre-  
quently than precedents indicate, and are oftenest either pretended, through  
levity or want of firmness ; or supposed, through want of knowledge. Ex-  
pedients often have been devised to effect, consistently with good faith,  
what has been done in contravention of it. Those who are most commonly  
creditors of a nation, are, generally speaking, enlightened men; and there  
are signal examples to warrant a conclusion, that, when a candid and fair  
appeal is made to them, they will understand their true interest too well to  
refuse their concurrence in such modifications of their claims as any real

known fact,” says he “ that in countsies where the national debt is properly fund-  
ed, it answers most of the purposes of meney. Transfers of stock or public debt  
are there equivalent to payments in specie; or in other words, stock in the princi-  
pal transactions of business passes current as specie. Trade is extended by it,  
because there is a larger capital to carry iton. Agriculture and manufactures are  
promoted by it foralike reason. The interest of money will be lowered by it, for  
this is always in ratio to the quantity of money, and to the quickness of circula-  
tion. From the combination of these effects, additional aids will be furnished to  
labor, to industry and to arts of every kind. But these good effects of a public  
debt are only to be looked for, when by being well funded, it has aequired an ad-  
equate and stable value.” These arguments viewed in connection with the obvi-

a National Debt as a national blessing, Though this inference might be drawn  
from his doctrine and policy, he yet, in express terms, declared himself against it.

352 Repudiation.  
  
To attempt to enumerate the complicated variety of mischiefs in the whole system  
of the social economy, which proceed from a neglect of the maxims that uphold  
public credit, and justify the solicitude manifested by the House on this point, would  
be an improper intrusion on their time and patience.  
  
In so strong a light, nevertheless, do they appear to the Secretary, that, on their  
due observance, at the present critical juncture, materially depends, in his judgment,  
the individual and aggregate prosperity of the citizens of the United States; their  
relief from the embarrassments they now. experience ; their character as a people ;  
the cause of good government.  
  
If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly so important, the next inquiry which  
suggests itself is, by what means is it to be effected? The ready answer to which ques-  
tion is, by good faith ; by a punctual performance of contracts. States, like individuals,  
who observe their engagements, are respected and trusted ; while the reverse is the fate of  
those who pursue an opposite conduct.  
  
Every breach of the public engagements, whether from choice or necessity, is, in  
different degrees, hurtful to public credit. When such a necessity does truly exist,  
the evils of it are only to be palliated by a scrupulous attention, on the part of the  
Government, to carry the violation no further than the necessity absolutely requires;  
and to manifest, if the nature of the case admit of it, a sincere disposition to make  
reparation whenever circumstances shall permit. But, with every possible mitiga-  
tion, credit must suffer, and numerous mischiefs ensue. It is, therefore, highly  
important, when an appearance of necessity seems to press upon the public councils,  
that they should examine well its reality, and be perfectly assured that there is no  
method of escaping from it, before they yield to its suggestions. For, though it  
cannot safely be affirmed that occasions have never existed, or may not exist, in  
which violations of the public faith, in this respect, are inevitable; yet there is great  
reason to believe that they exist far less frequently than precedents indicate, and are  
oftenest either pretended, through levity or want of firmness; or supposed, through  
want of knowledge. Expedients often have been devised to effect, consistently  
with good faith, what has been done in contravention of it. Those who are most  
commonly creditors of a nation, are, generally speaking, enlightened men ; and there  
are signal examples to warrant a conclusion, that, when a candid and fair appeal is  
made to them, they will understand their true interest too well to refuse their con-  
currence in such modifications of their claims as any real necessity may demand.  
  
While the observance of that good faith, which is the basis of public credit, is  
recommended by the strongest inducements of political expediency, it is enforced  
by considerations of still greater authority. There are arguments for it which rest  
on the immutable principles of moral obligation. And in proportion as the mind is  
disposed to contemplate, in the order of Providence, an intimate connection between  
public virtue and public happiness, will be its repugnancy to a violation of those  
principles.

by the legislators and financiers of this Union. The sentiments of that  
writer may well be adopted as a text or model for future statesmen,  
and should be especially engrafted upon the public policy of those  
States whose finances are dilapidated or verging on repudiation.  
  
The Secretary has too much deference for the opinions of every part of the com-  
munity, not to have observed one which has more than once made its appearance in  
the public prints, and which is occasionally to be met with in conversation. It  
involves this question: Whether a discrimination ought not to be made between  
original holders of the public securities and present possessors by purchase? Those  
who advocate a discrimination, are for making a full provision for the securities of  
the former at their nominal value; but contend that the latter ought to receive no  
more than the cost to them, and the interest. And the idea is sometimes suggested,  
of making good the difference to the primitive possessor.  
  
In favor of this scheme, it is alleged, that it would be unreasonable to pay twenty  
shillings in the pound to one who had not given more for it than three or four. And  
it is added, that it would be hard to aggravate the misfortune of the first owner, who,  
probably, through necessity, parted with his preperty at so great a loss, by obliging  
him to contribute to the profit of the person who had speculated on his distresses.  
  
The Secretary, after the most mature reflection on the force of this argument, is  
induced to reject the doctrine it contains, as equally unjust and impolitic; as highly  
injurious, even to the original holders of public securities ; as ruinous to public credit.  
  
It is inconsistent with justice, because, in the first place, it is a breach of con-  
tract—a violation of the rights of a fair purchaser.  
  
The nature of the contract, in its origin, is, that the public will pay the sum  
expressed in the security, to the first holder or his assignee. The intent in making  
the security assignable, is, that the proprietor may be able to make use of his pro-  
perty, by selling it for as much as it may be worth in the market, and that the buyer  
may be safe in the purchase.  
  
Every buyer, therefore, stands exactly in the place of the seller; has the same  
right with him to the identical sum expressed in the security ; and, having acquired  
that right by fair purchase, and in conformity to the original agreement and in-  
tention of the Government, his claim cannot be disputed without manifest injustice,

exigencles are expented to occur in the aff drs of  
nations, in which there will be a necessity for borrowing.  
that loans in imes of pubhe danger, eapecdaly from ioe  
war, are found an indispensable resource, even to  
the wealthicet of them, and that, in a country which, like  
this, is poaressed of little active wealth, or in other words,  
little moneyed capital, the necersity for that resource must  
in auch emergencies be proportionably urgont. And as  
on the other hand, ine necesaily for borrowing in parden  
emergencies cannot be doubted, so on the other it is  
equally evident that, to be able to borrow upon good terms  
it is ersential that the credit of a nation shoulo be well es  
tablished; for when the credit of a country is in any degree  
questionable, it rever fails to give an extravagant premium  
in one chape or another, upon all the loans it has occasion  
to make.  
Nor does the evil end here; the same dlsadvantage  
must be sustained upon whatever is to be bought on terms  
of future payment. From this constant neco sity of bor  
rowing and buying dear, it is easy to conceive how im  
menrely the expenres of a nation in course of time will be  
augmented by an unsound state of the public credit. To  
tiempt to ennmorate the complicated varlety of  
mis obiefs it the whole system of the social economy  
which proceed from the maxims that uphold public credit  
and justhy the solicitude manifested by tho Souse on this  
point, would be an improper intrusion on their time and  
patlence.  
In so streng a light, nevertheless, do they appear to the  
Secretary, that in their due observance, at the present  
critical juncture, materially depends in his judgment the  
individt al and aggregate prosperny of the citizens of the  
United States; their relief from the embarrassments they  
now experience; their character as a people; the cause of  
good government  
If the maintenance of public credit then be truly so im

are respected and trusted, while the reverse is ine  
fate of those who pursue an opposite conduct. Evory  
breach of the public engagements, whether from choice or  
necesaity, is, in different degrees, hurtfpl to public credit  
When such a necessity coos truly exist, the evil of it are  
only to be paliated by a crupulous attention on the part  
of the Government to carry the violation no farther than  
the necersity absolutely requires, and to macifest, if the  
nature of the case admit of it, a sincere disposition to make  
reparations wheneyer circumstances shall vermit. But  
with every possible minigation, credit muet suffer and  
numerous mirchiefs ensue. It is therefore highly im  
portant, when an apoozrance of secessity seems to  
press pen the public counci&#x27;s, that they shoold examine  
well its reality, and be perfectly assaroi that there is no

have been devised to effect, consistently with good faith,

speaking, enl ghtened men; and there are signal exampled  
to warrant a sonclation that when a canld and far wae

every other citizen is interested. It is a well-known fact, that in countries in  
which the national debt is properly funded, and an object of established confidence,  
it answers most of the purposes of money. Transfers of stock or public debt are there  
equivalent to payments in specie; or, in other words, stock, in the principal trans-

To attempt to enumerate the complicated variety of mischiefs in the whole sy:-  
tem of the social economy, which proceed from a neglect of the maxims that upholl  
public credit, and justify the solicitude manifested by the House on this point,  
would be an improper intrusion on their time and patience. In so strong a light,  
nevertheless, do they appear to the Secretary, that, on their due observance, at  
the present critical juncture, materially depends, in his judgment, the individual  
and aggregate prosperity of the citizens of the United States; their relief from the  
embarrassments they now experience; their character as a people; the cause of  
good government. If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly so important,  
the next inquiry which suggests itself is, By what means is it to be effected? The

ready answer to which question is, by good faith; by a punctual performance of  
contracts. States, like individuals, who observe their engagements, are respected  
and trusted; while the reverse is the fate of those who pursue an opposite conduct.  
  
Every breach of the public engagements, whether from choice or necessity, is, in  
different degrees, hurtful to public credit, When such a necessity does truly exist,  
the evils of it are only to be palliated by a scrupulous attention, on the part of the  
government, to carry the violation no further than the necessity absolutely re-  
quires ; and to manifest, if the nature of the case admit of it, a sincere disposition to  
make reparation whenever circumstances shall permit. But, with every possible  
nitigation, credit must suffer, and numerous mischiefs ensue, It is, therefore,  
highly important, when an appearance of necessity seems to press upon the public  
councils, that they should examine well its reality, and be perfectly assured that  
there is no method of escaping from it, before they yield to its suggestions. For,  
though it cannot safely be affirmed that occasions have never existed, or may not  
exist, in which violations of the public faith, in this respect, are inevitable; yet  
there is great reason to believe that they exist far less frequently than precedents  
indicate, and are oftenest either pretended, through levity or want of firmness; or  
supposed, through want of knowledge. Expedients often have been devised to  
effect, consistently with good faith, what has been done in contravention of it.  
Those who are most commonly creditors of a nation are, generally speaking, en-  
lightened men; and there are signal examples to warrant a conclusion, that, when a  
candid and fair appeal is made to them, they will understand their true interest too  
well to refuse their concurrence in such modifications of their claims as any real  
necessity may demand, :  
  
While the observance of that good faith, which is the basis of public credit, is  
  
recommended by the strongest inducements of political expediency, it is enforced  
by considerations of still greater authority. There are arguments for it which rest  
on the immutable principles of moral obligation, And in proportion as the mind is  
disposed to contemplate, in the order of Providence, an intimate connection between  
public virtue and public happiness, will be its repugnance to a violation of those  
rinciples.  
This reflection derives additional strength from the nature of the debt of the  
United States, It was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeat-  
edly pledged for it, and with solemnities that give peculiar force to the obligation,  
There is, indeed, reason to regret that it has not hitherto been kept; that the ne-  
cessities of the war, conspiring with inexperience in the subjects of finance, produced  
direct infractions ; and that the subsequent period has been a continued scene of  
negative violation, or non-compliance. But a diminution of this regret arises from  
the reflection, that the last seven years have exhibited an earnest and uniform effort,  
on the part of the government of the Union, to retrieve the national credit, by doing  
justice to the creditors of the nation; and that the embarrassments of a defective  
constitution, which defeated this laudable effort, have ceased.

the principle that no public debt should be created without measures for  
its extinguishment. He said :*  
  
“ Persuaded as the Secretary is, that the proper funding of the present debt will  
render it a national blessing, yet he is so far from acceding to the position, in the  
latitude in which it is sometimes laid down, that ‘ public debts are public benefits—  
a position inviting to prodigality, and liable to dangerous abuse—that he ardently  
wishes to see it incorporated, as a fundamental maxim, in the system of public  
credit of the United States, that the creation of debt should always be accompanied  
with the means of extinguishment. This he regards as the true secret for rendering  
public credit immortal. And he presumes that it is difficult to conceive a situation  
in which there may not be an adherence to the maxim. At least, he feels an  
unfeigned solicitude that this may be attempted by the United States, and that they  
a commence their measures for the establishment of credit with the observance  
of it.”

in relation to the Public Debt:  
&quot;It has been stated that the  
debt of the United States  
consists of the Foreign debt,  
amounting, with arrears of  
interest, to  $11,710,378.82

the individual States is not equally well as­  
certained. The Secretary, however, pre  
sumes that the total amount may be safely  
stated at twenty-five millions dollars, prin

problem now occurs. Is it in the power of  
tbe United S tales, consistently with those pru­  
dential considerations that ought not to be  
overlooked, to mako a provision equal to the  
purpose of funding the whole debt, at the  
ratys of interest which it now bears, in addi­  
tion to the sum which will bo necessary for

&quot; The Secretary will not say that such a  
provision will exceed the abilities of the  
country; but he is clearly of opinion that to  
make it would require tho extension of  
taxation to a degree which the true interest  
of the public creditors forbids. It is there­  
fore to be hoped, and even to be expected,  
that they will cheerfully concur in such  
modifications of their claims on fair and  
equitable principles os will facilitate to the  
government an arrangement, substantial,  
durable, and satisfactory to the community.  
Tbe importance of tbe last consideration

it did not belong,‘could be truly entitled to

sources greatly beyond what is now deemed  
sufficient for the current service ; and that

choice or necessity, is, in different degrees, hurtful to public credit. When such  
a necessity does truly exist, the evils of it are only to be palliated by scrupulous  
attention, on the part of the Government, to carry the violation no further than  
the necessity absolutely requires; and to manifest, if the nature of the case admit

While the observance of that good faith, which is the basis of  
public credit, is recommended by the strongest inducements of po-  
litical expediency, it is enforced by considerations of still greater  
authority. ‘There are arguments for it which rest on the immuta-  
ble principles of moral obligation. And in proportion as the mind  
is disposed to contemplate, in the order of Providence, an intimate  
connexion between public virtue and public happiness, will be its  
repugnancy to a violation of those principles.  
  
This reflection derives additional strength from the nature of the  
debt of the Unitep States. It was the price of liberty. The  
faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and with  
solemnities that give peculiar force to the obligation. There is, in-

It will not be forgotten that exigencies may, ere long, arise,  
which would call for resources greatly beyond what is now deemed  
sufficient for the current service; and that, should the faculties of  
the country be exhausted, or even strained, to provide for the  
public debt, there could be less reliance on the sacredness of the  
provision. But while the Secretary yields to the force of these  
considerations, he does not lose sight of those fundamental princi-  
ples of good faith, which dictate that every practicable exertion  
ought to be made, scrupulously to fulfill the engagements of the  
Government; that no change in the rights of its creditors ought  
to be attempted, without their voluntary consent; and that this  
consent ought to be voluntary in fact, as well as in name. Con-  
sequently, that every proposal of a change ought to be in the  
shape of an appeal to their reason and to their interest, not to  
their necessities. To this end, it is requisite that a fair equivalent  
should be offered for what may be asked to be given up, and  
unquestionable security for the remainder. Without this, an alter-  
ation consistently with the credit and honor of the nation would  
be impracticable.—//id.

Persuaded as the Secretary is that the proper funding of the  
present debt will render it a national blessing, yet he is so far  
from acceding to the position, in the latitude in which it is some-  
times laid down, that “public debts are public benefits”—a posi-  
tion inviting to prodigality, and liable to dangerous abuse—that  
he ardently wishes to see it incorporated, as a fundamental maxim,  
in the system of public credit of the Unirep Srares, that the  
creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of  
extinguishment. This he regards as the true secret for rendering.  
public credit immortal. And he presumes that it is difficult to  
conceive a situation in which there may not be an adherence to  
the maxim. At least, he feels an unfeigned solicitude that this  
may be attempted by the Unirep States, and that they may

Deeply impressed as the Secretary is with a full and deliberate  
conviction that the establishment of the public credit, upon the  
basis of a satisfactory provision for the public debt, is, under the  
present circumstances of this country, the true desideratum towards  
relief from individual and national embarrassments; that, without  
it, these embarrassments will be likely to press still more severely  
upon the community: he cannot but indulge an anxious wish that  
an effectual plan for that purpose may, during the present session,  
be the result of the united wisdom of the Legislature.  
  
He is fully convinced that it is of the greatest importance that  
no further delay should attend the making of the requisite pro-  
vision; not only because it will give a better impression of the  
good faith of the country, and will bring earlier relief to the cred-  
itors, (both of which circumstances are of great moment to public  
credit,) but because the advantages to the community, from raising  
stock as speedily as possible to its riatural value, will be incom-

“If all the public creditors receive their dues from one source,  
distributed with an equal hand, their interest will be the same.  
And having the same interests they will unite in the support of  
the fiscal arrangements of the government,—as these too can  
be made with more convenience where there is no competition.”  
  
“ If, on the contrary, there are distinct provisions, there will  
be distinct interests, drawing different ways. That union and  
concert of views, among the creditors, which in every govern-  
ment is of great importance to their security, and to that of  
public credit, will not only not exist, but will be likely to give  
place to mutual jealousy and opposition. And from this cause  
the operation of the systems which may be adopted, both by  
the particular States and by the Union, with relation to their  
respective debts, will be in danger of being counteracted.”  
Proof is then offered that the State creditors would be in a  
worse position than those of the Union, and the injurious  
effects of this pointed out. The debts of the States are shown  
to be of the same nature as those of the Union, and this por-  
tion of the Report concludes with a plan for assumption.*

est of four per cent., irredeemable by any payment exceeding five  
dollars per annum, on account both of principal and interest, and to  
receive, as a compensation for the reduction of interest, fifteen dol-  
lars and eighty cents, payable in lands, as in the preceding case; or,  
  
[3] To have sixty-six dollars and two-thirds of a dollar funded  
immediately at an annuity or yearly interest of six per cent., irre-  
deemable by any payment exceeding four dollars and two-thirds of a  
dollar per annum, on account both of principal and interest, and to  
have, at the end of ten years, twenty-six dollars and eighty-eight  
cents funded at the like interest and rate of redemption; or,  
  
[4] To have an annuity, for the remainder of life, upon the con-  
tingency of living to a given age, not less distant than ten years,  
computing interest at four per cent.; or,  
  
[5] To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the contin-

debt will render it a national blessing, yet he is so far  
from acceding to the position, in the latitude in which it  
is sometimes laid down, that public debts are public bene-  
fits, a position inviting to prodigality and liable to danger-

as a fundamental maxim, in the system of public credit  
of the United States, that the creation of debt should  
always be accompanied with the means of extinguish-  
ment.” This declaration, not standing alone, but repeated  
on other occasions,§ places his opinion as to national debts  
on consistent and easily defensible grounds. How far it
