You will observe from the Tenor of the Resolves that if any one or more of the States immediately pass a Law vesting in Congress the Powers requested, it cannot take Effect or operate to any Purpose until all the States that are not prevented by the Events of the War, shall have passed similar Laws. That is, at present, all the States except South Caro
