ng 28th Sepr 1779.  
In mine of the 30th ultimo, I had the honor of informing your Excellency of the victory obtained over the enemy on the 29th of August, I now do myself the honor to inform you of the progress of this army, and the most material occurrences, which have since taken place. The time taken up in destroying the corn in the neighbourhood of New-Town (employing the army near two days) and there appearing a probability, that the destruction of all the crops might take a much greater length of time, than was at first apprehended, and being likewise convinced by an accurate calculation, that it would not be possible, to effect the destruction of the Indian Country, with the provision on hand, which was all I had in store; and indeed all that I had pack-horses to transport from Tioga. In this situation I could think of but one expedient, to answer the end designed by the expedition; which was, to prevail (if possible) on the soldiers, to content themselves with half a pound of flour, and the same quantity of fresh beef per day, rather than leave the important business unfinished. I therefore drew up an address to the soldiers, a copy of which I have the honor to inclose you, which being read, was answered by three cheers from the whole army. Not one dissenting voice was heard from either officer or soldier. I had then on hand by the best calculation I could make 22 lb. of flour and sixteen pounds of beef pr man. The former liable to many deductions—from rains—crossing rivers—and defiles &amp;c. the latter much more so, from the almost unavoidable loss of cattle, when suffered to range the woods at night for their support. I was however encouraged in the belief, that I should be inabled, to effect the destruction and total ruin of the Indian territories by this truely noble and virtuous resolution of the army for which I know not, whether the public stand most indebted to the persuasive arguments, which the offi[c]ers began to use, or to the virtuous disposition of the Soldiers, whose immediate and cheerful compliance with the requisition, anticipated all their wishes, and rendered persuasion unnecessary.  
I sent back all my heavy artillery on the night of the 30th, retaining only four brass three pounders, and a small Howitzer—Loaded the necessary amunition on horseback, and marched early on the 31st for ⟨illegible⟩ Cathrine’s Town: On our way we destroyed a small settlement of eight houses, and a Town called Konnawaughhally of about 20 houses, situated on a peninsula at the conflux of the Cayuga and  
  
Tioga branches—we also destroyed several fields of corn. From this Col. Dayton was detached with his regiment, and the Rifle corps up the Tioga, about six miles, and destroyed several large fields of corn. The army ressumed their march, and incamped within 13½ Miles of Catharine’s town, where we arrived the next day, although, we had a road to open for our artillery, and had to pass through a swamp of nine miles in extent, and almost impervious. We arrived near Cathrine’s Town in the night, and moved on with hopes to surprise it, but found it foresaken. The next morning an old woman of the Cayuga nation was found in the woods, who informed that the night after the battle of New-Town the enemy had fled all night, and arrived there in great confusion early the next day. That she heard the warriors tell their women, that they were conquered, and must fly—that they had a great many killed and vast numbers wounded. She likewise heard the lamentations of many, for the loss of their connexions. In addition to this, she assured us, that some other warriors had met Butler at this place and desired him to return and fight again. But to this request they could obtain no satisfactory answer: for as they observed Butlers mouth was closed. The warriors who had been in the action were equally averse to the proposal, and would think of nothing but flight, and the removal of their families. That they kept runners on every mountain, to observe the motions of our army who reported (early in the day on which we arrived) that our advance was very rapid, upon which all those who had not been before sent off, fled with precipitation, leaving her without any possible means of escape. She said that Brandt had taken most of the wounded up the Tioga branch in Canoes. I was from many circumstances, fully convinced of the truth, and sincerity of her declaration and the more so, as we had on the day we left New-Town, discovered a great number of bloody packs, arms and accoutrements, thrown away in the road, and in the woods on each side of it. besides which we discovered a number of recent graves—Those circumstances when added to that of so many warriors being left dead on the field (a circumstance not common with Indians) were sufficient to corroborate this womans declaration, and to prove what I before conjectured, namely, that the loss of the enemy was much greater, than was at first apprehended. I have never been able to ascertain, with any degree of certainty, what number of the enemy were opposed to us at New-Town, but from the best accounts I have been able to collect, and from the opinion of General Poor and others, who had the best opportunity of viewing their numbers, as well as from the extent of their lines, I suppose their numbers to have been near 1500—tho’ the two persons whom I believe totally ignorant of the numbers at any post except their own, as well as of the  
  
enemy’s disposition, estimate them only at 800, while they allow that 5 companies of Rangers, all the warriors of Seneca, and six other nations were collected at this place. In order to determine their numbers with as much accuracy as was in my power, I examined their breast-work and find the extent of it more than half a mile; several bastions ran out in its front to flank it in every part; a small block house formerly occupied as a dwelling house, was also manned in front of the line. The breast work appeared to have been fully manned, tho’ I suppose only with one rank—Some part of the work being low, they were obliged to dig holes in the ground to cover themselves in part. This circumstance enabled me to judge the distance between their men in the works. A very thin scattering line, designed only as I suppose, for communicating signals, was continued from those works, to that part of the mountain which General Poor ascended, where they had a very large body—which was designed I imagine to fall on our flank. The distance from their breast work to this place was at least one mile and a half—from thence to the hill in rear of our right, was another scattering line, of about one mile, and on the hill a breast work with a strong party, destined, it is supposed, to fall on our rear. But general Clinton being ordered so far to the right, occasioned his flank to pass over this mountain, which obliged them, to abandon this post—From those circumstances, as well as from the opinion of others, I cannot conceive their numbers to have been less, than what I have before mentioned. The army spent one day at Catherine’s in destroying the corn, and fruit trees. We burnt the Town which consisted of about 30 houses, and the next day encamped near a small scattering settlement of about 8 houses; and in two days after reached Kandahee, which we also found deserted—Here one of the inhabitants of Wyoming, who was captured last year by the enemy, escaped from them, and joined us. He informed that the enemy had left the Town in the greatest confusion, three days before our arrival. He said he conversed with some of the tories, on their return from the action at Newto[w]n who assured him they had great numbers killed and wounded, and there was no safety but in flight. He heard Butler tell them, they must try to make a stand at Konadasagea—but they declared they would not throw away their lives in a vain attempt to oppose such an army. He also heard many of the Indian women lamenting the loss of their connexions, and added that Brandt had taken most of the wounded in water-craft (up the Tioga) which had been provided to answer that purpose in case of necessity. It was his opinion the King of Konadasagea was killed as he saw him go down, but not return; and gave a description of his person and dress, which exactly corresponded with one found on the field of  
  
action. This Town of Konadahee consisted of 20 houses, very neatly built and finished, which we reduced to ashes; and the army spent near a day in destroying the corn and fruit trees, of which there was great abundance; many of the trees appeared to be of great age. The next day we crossed the outlet of the Seneca Lake, and moved in three divisions, through the wood to encircle Konadasagea, but found it likewise abandoned. A white child of about three years old (doubtless the offspring of some unhappy captive) was found here, and carried on with the Army—A detachment of 400 Men was sent down the West side of Seneca lake to destroy Gothseunqueau and the plantations in that quarter. at the same time, a number of Volunteers under Colonel Harper went ten Miles towards Cayuga Lake and destroyed Schoyese, and the residue of the Army was employed in destroying the Corn at Kanasedagea, of which, there was a large quantity. This town consisted of 50 Houses and was very pleasantly situated, in it we found a great number of fruit trees, which were destroyed with the town. The Army then moved on, and in two days, arrived at Kanandaique, and were joined on the Road by the detachment sent on the West side of Seneca lake, it having been almost two days employed in destroying the Crops and settlements there—At Kanandaique we found 23 very elegant Houses, mostly framed, and in general very large. We also found very extensive feilds of Corn, which having destroyed we marched to Honyaye, a small town of ten Houses which we also destroyed (leaving a strong Garrison, our heavy stores and one feild peice) and proceeded to Chenessee, which the prisoners informed me was the grand Capital of the Indian Country: That Indians of all nations had been planting there this Spring, and that all the Rangers and some British had been employed in assisting them, that they might raise supplies sufficient to support them while destroying our frontiers. That they had themselves worked three Weeks for the Indians in planting. This determined me at all events to reach that settlement, tho’ the State of my provisions (much reduced by unavoidable accidents) almost forbad the attempt. My flour had been much reduced by the failure of pack Horses; passing Creeks and defiles, and 27 of the Cattle had been unavoidably lost. We however marched on for the Chenessee Town, and the second day reached a town of 25 Houses called Kanegsaus—Here we found some large Corn feilds which a part of the army destroyed, while another part was employed in building a Bridge over an unfordable Creek between that and Chenessee. I had the preceding evening ordered out an Officer with three or four Riflemen, one of our Guides and an Oneida Cheif, to reconnoitre the Chenessee town, that we might if possible surprise it. Lieut. Boyd of the Rifle Corps was the officer intrusted who took  
  
with him twenty three Men, who turned out as Volunteers from the Corps and a few from Colo. Butlers Regt making in the whole 26, a much larger number than I had thoughts of sending, and by no means so likely to answer the purpose as that which was at first directed. The guides, who were by no means acquainted with the Country, mistook the Road in the night, and at day break fell in with a Castle six Miles higher up the River than Chenessee, inhabited by a tribe called Squattchakaws—here they saw a few Indians and killed and scalped two—the rest fled—Two runners were immediately dispatched to me with the account and informed that the party was on its return. When the Bridge was almost compleated, some of them came in and informed that Lieut. Boyd and most of his party were surrounded by the enemy—that the Indians had been discove

g themselves before him for some miles—that his Men had killed two and were eagerly pursuing the rest, but soon found themselves almost surrounded by 3 or 400 Indians and Rangers—Those of Mr Boyds Men who were sent to secure his flanks fortunately made their escape, but he with fourteen of his Men and the Oneida Cheif being in the Centre, were compleatly incircled. All the light troops of the Army, and the flanking divisions were immediately detached to their releif, but arrived too late. The enemy had destroyed the party and escaped. It appeared that our Men had taken to a small Grove of trees, the ground around it being clear on every side for several Rods, and there fought till Mr Boyd was shot thro’ the Body, and every man killed but one, who with his wounded Commander were made prisoners. The firing was so close, before this brave party was destroyed, that the powder of the enemy’s Musquetts was driven into their flesh. In this conflict, the enemy must have suffered greatly, as they had no cover and our Men were possessed of a very advantagious one. This advantage of Ground—the obstinate bravery of the party—with some other circumstances induce me to beleive their loss must have been very considerable. They were so long employed in taking away and secreting their dead, that the advancing of General Hands party obliged them to leave one of them along side of the Rifle Men—and at least a Waggon load of packs—Blankets—Hats and provisions, which they had thrown off to enable them to act with more agility in the feild, most of them appeared to appertain to the Rangers. Another Reason which induces me to suppose they suffered much was the unparalled tortures which they inflicted upon the brave unfortunate Boyd, whose Body, with that of his unfortunate companion we found at Chenessee. It appeared that they had whipped them in the most cruel manner, pulled out the Nails of Mr Boyd, cut off his nose, plucked out one of his Eyes—cut out his tongue, stabbed him with spears in sundry places,  
  
and inflicted other tortures which decency will not permit me to mention—then cut off his head and left his Body on the Ground with that of his unfortunate Companion who appears to have experienced the same savage Barbarity. The party which Mr Boyd seems to have fallen in with, was commanded by Colonel Butler, and had been posted in an advantagious peice of Ground in order to fire upon our Army when advancing, but found their design frustrated by the appearance of this party in their Rear. The Army moved in that day to the Castle last mentioned and which consist⟨ed⟩ of 25 Houses, and had very extensive feilds of Corn, which being destroyed we moved on the next day to the Chenessee Town crossing in our Route a deep Creek and the little Seneca River and in marching six Miles we reached the Castle, which consisted of 128 Houses mostly very large and elegant. The town is beautifully situated—almost incircled with a clear flat, which extends for a number of Miles, on which were the most extensive feilds of Corn, and every kind of Vegetable, that can be conceived. The whole Army was immediately engaged in destroying the Crops—The Corn was gathered and burnt in Houses and in Kilns, that the Enemy might not reap the least advantage from it, which method we have pursued in every other place—Here a Woman came to us who had been captured at Wyoming. She informed us that the Enemy had evacuated the town two days before—that Butler at the same time went off with 300 or 400 Indians and Rangers, as he said, to get a shot at our Army. This was undoubtedly the party which cut off Lt Boyd. She mentioned that they kept Runners constantly out, and, when our Army was in motion, the intelligence was communicated by a Yell, immediately on which, the greatest terror and confusion apparently took place among them. She said that the Women were constantly begging the Warriors to sue for peace, and, that one of the Indians had attempted to shoot Colo. Johnson, for the falsehoods, by which he had deceived and ruined them—that she overheard Butler telling Johnston that it was impossible, to keep the Indians together, after the Battle of Newtown—that he thought they must soon be in a miserable situation, as all their Crops would be destroyed, and that Canada could not supply them with provisions at Niagara—that he would endeavour to collect the Warriors to assist in the defence of that Fort, which, he was of opinion, the Army would lay seige to, and the Women and Children he would send into Canada—After having destroyed this town beyond which I was informed there was no settlement, and destroyed all their Houses and Crops in that quarter—the Army having been advancing seventeen days with the supply of provisions before mentioned, and that much reduced on the march by accident—and the Cayuga Country being as yet unpenetrated, I thought it  
  
necessary to return as soon as possible in order to effect the destruction of the settlements in that quarter. The Army therefore began its march for Kanadasago the 18th day from its leaving Newtown. At Canadasago I was met by a sachem from Oneida and three Warriors, one of whom I had sent from Catharine’s with a letter, a Copy of which I have the honor to enclose Your Excellency. They delivered me a Message from the Warriors of that Nation, respecting the Cayugas—Copies of that and my Answer I likewise inclose—From this place I detached Colo. Smith with a party down the west side of Seneca Lake to dest[r]oy the Corn which had been cut down, and to destroy any thing further, which might be discovered there—I then detached Col. Gansevoort with 100 Men to albany to forward the baggage of the York regiments to the main army, &amp; to take with him such Soldiers as were at that place—I directed him to destroy the lower mohawk Castle in his route, and capture the Inhabitants, consisting only of Six or seven families who are constantly employed in giving intelligence to the enemy, and in supporting their scouting parties, when making incursions on our frontiers. When the Mohawks joined the Enemy, those few families were undoubtedly left, to answer those purposes; and to keep possession of their Lands. The upper Castle now inhabited by Orescoes, our Friends, he was directed not [to] disturb. With him, I sent Mr Dean, who bore my answer to the Oneidas. I then detached Col. Butler with 600 men to destroy the Cayuga Country, and with him, sent all the Indian Warriors, who said, if they could find the Cayugas, they would endeavour to persuade them to deliver themselves up as prisoners. The chief of them called Pigathlawance being a near relation to the Sachem. I then crossed the Seneca river, &amp; detached Col. Dearborne to the West side of the Cayuga Lake, to destroy all the settlements which might be found there and to intercept the Cayugas if they attempted to escape Colonel Butler, the residue of the army passing on between the Lakes towards Catherines. Col. Dearborne burnt in his route six Towns including one which had been before partly destroyed by a small party—destroying at the same time large quantity’s of Corn—He took an Indian lad and 3 Women prisoners—one of the Women being very antient and the lad a cripple, He left them and brought on the other two, and joined the army on the evening of the 26th Col. Cortland was then detached with 500 Men up the Tioga branch to seek for settlements in that quarter and in the space of two days destroyed several fields of corn &amp; burnt several houses—Col. Butler joined the army on the 28th whereby a compleat junction was formed at Canaughwallahalley on the 29th day after our leaving New Town, here we were met by a plenty of Provisions from Tioga which I had previously directed to be sent on—Col.  
  
Butler destroyed in the Cayuga Country five principal Towns and a number of scattering Towns, the whole making about 100 in number exceedingly large &amp; well built—He also destroyed 200 Acres of excellent corn with a number of orchards one of which had in it 1500 fruit Trees—another Indian settlement was discovered near new Town (by a party) consisting of 39 new houses which was also destroyed. The number of Towns destroyed by this army amounts to 40 besides scattering houses—the quantity of Corn destroyed at a moderate computation must amount to 160,000 Bushls with a vast quantity of vegetables of every kind—Every creek &amp; river has been traced and the whole Country explored in search of Indian settlements, &amp; I am persuaded except one Town situated near the allegany about 57 Miles from Chenessee—there is not a single Town left in the Country of the five nations—It is with pleasure I inform your Excellency that this army has not suffered the loss of 40 men in action or otherwise since my taking the command, tho’ perhaps few Troops have experienced a more fatigueing Campaign—Besides the difficulties which naturally attend marching through an Enemy’s Country abounding in Woods, Creeks, rivers mountains, Morasses and defiles, we found no small inconvenience from the want of proper Guides, and the maps of the Country are so exceedingly erroneous that they serve not to enlighten but to perplex. We had not a single person who was sufficiently acquainted with the Country to conduct a party out of the Indian path by day or scarcely in it by night though they were the best I could possibly procure—Their ignora[n]ce doubtless arose from the Indians ever having taken the best measures in their power to prevent their Countrys being explored—We had much labor in clearing out roads for the artillery notwithstanding which, the army moved from 12 to 16 miles every day, when not detained by rains, or employed in destroying settlements—I feel my self much indebted to the Officers of every rank for their unparalled exertions, and to the Soldiers for the unshaken firmness, with which they endured the toils and difficulties attending the expedition. Though I had it not in command, I should have ventured to have paid Niagara a visit, had I been supplied with fifteen days provision, in addition to what I had, which I am persuaded from the bravery &amp; ardor of our Troops, would have fallen into our hands. I forgot to mention that The Oneida Sachem requested me to grant them liberty to hunt in the Country of the five nations, as they would never think of setling again in a country, once subdued, and where, their settlements must ever be in our power. I in answer informed him, that I had no authority to grant such a licence, that I could not at present see reason to object to it, but advised them to make application to Congress, who I believed would in consideration of their  
  
friendly conduct grant them every advantage of this kind that would not interfere with our settlement of the Country, which I believed would soon take place. The oneidas say, that as no Indians were discovered by Col. Butler at Cayuga, they are of opinion they are gone to their Castle, and, that their chiefs will persuade them, to come in and surrender themselves on the terms I have proposed—The army began its march from Connawallahalley yesterday, arrived here last evening—will be at Tioga this night; after giving them time to refresh, I shall mov

TEAOGA, Sept. 30th, 1779,  
SIR, ,  
&#x27;IN mine of the zoth ult. to his Excellency  
General Wafthington, and by him trani­  
mitted to Congress, | gave an account of the  
viétory obtaifnied by thisarmy over the ene­  
my at Newton, on the 29th of Auguft,——  
I new do myfelf the hounor to intorm Con­  
greis of the progress of this aimy, and the  
wmolt material occurunces which have since  
- taken place. A &#x27;  
. The time tzken up in destroying the corn  
_in the neighbourhocd of riewtun employing  
the army near two days,and there appearing  
‘2 probability that the destruction ot all the  
crops might take a much greater length of  
time then was at firft apprehended and be­  
ing likewile convinced, by an accurate calcu­  
lation, that it wou d not be poflibie to effect  
‘the deftruttion of the Indian ccuntry, with  
the provision on hand; which was zill had  
in store,; and indeed all 1 had pack horses to  
transport from Teaoga ; in this fGtuation I  
could think of but one expsdient to aniwer  
tue purposes of the expedition, which was to  
prevail, if possible on the soldiers to content.  
themielves with half a-pound of ficur, and  
the fame quantity of freth beef per day,  
rather then leave the important business un­  
finithed., I therefore drew np an address to  
them, a copy of which I have the honour  
o inclofe you, which being read, was an-  
Ywered by three cheers from the whole army.  
&quot;~ Not one deflenting voice was heard from  
-either officer or foidier. I had then on hand,  
from the bett calculation ] could make, twen­  
ty-two p unds of flour and sixteen pounds of  
Beef per man ; the former liable to many  
dedyéticns byrains, crossing rivere and defiles&#x27;;  
the latter much mors o, Irom the alinoft un­  
avoidable loss of cattle,when fuffered torange  
the woods at night for their support. I was,  
however, encouraged in the belief, that 1  
tfhould be enabled to eﬁ&#x27;éit the diftruétion and  
total ruin of the Indian&quot;territories, by this  
truly noble virtuous resolution of the army,  
for whichl knew not wether the public stand =  
more indebied to the persuasive arguments  
which the oificers began to use, or to the vir­  
tuous disposition of the soldiers whose prudent  
sand cheariul compliance with the requisition  
anticipated all their wifhes,and rendered per­  
suasion unnecessary. Ifentbackallmy beavy  
artillery on the night of the 3oth, retaining  
only tour brais three pounders, and a small  
howiiger, loaded the neceflary ammunition  
on horse back,and marched carly on the3ift  
for Catharine’s town. On cur way we deit­  
goyed a imail fetrlement o 8 houses, and town  
called Knawaholee, of about 20 houses, situ­  
ated on 2 peninsula at the conflux of the Te­  
2oga and Cayuga branches. We also destroy­  
ed several field. of corn. From this Colonel  
Dayron wasdetached with his regiment and  
“the riflecorps up the Teanga about {ix miles, w  
wi destroyed several large fields ot corn.  
The army mefumed their march, and encam­  
ped within thirteen miles and 2n half of Ca­  
tharine’s town, where we arrived the next  
day, although we had a road to open for the  
artillery, through a swamp nine miles in ex­  
tent, and almost impervious. We arrived near  
Catharine’s town in the night, and moved on  
in hopes to furprize it, but found it forfaken.—  
*On the next morning an old womab of thes  
Cayuga nation was found in the woods, who  
informed, that on the night after the battle  
»t Newton, the enemy having fled the whole  
time, arrived there in great confufien early -  
the next day ; that she heard the warriors tell  
their women, they were conquered, and mult  
fly ; thatr they had a great many killed, and  
vast numbers wounded. She likewise heard  
the lamentations ot many at the loss of their .  
connexions. In zddition to this, she aflured  
us, that some other warriots had met Butler  
at this place, and desired bhim to return  
and fight again. But to thisrequeft they could  
oh&#x27;ain no fafi:fadtory answer, for, as they  
o served, ” Butler&#x27;s mouth was closed,” The­  
warriors who had been. in the adtion were  
equally averse to the propozl, and weuld  
¢hink of nothing but flight and removal of  
¢heir families 3 that they kept rpaners on  
“every mountain Vto-obfer‘_ve the meotion of our  
  
army, who reported ezrly in the day on which  
we arrived, that our advance was very rapid,  
upon which zll those that had been berore  
lent off fled with precepitation, leaving her  
without any pofiible means of escape. bShe  
said that Braidt had taken mast of the woun­  
ded up the T&#x27;eoaga in cances. I was from ma­  
ny circumances fully convinced of the truth  
and sincerity of her declaration, and the  
more {o, as we had, the day we ‘left New­  
ton,difcovered agreat nuimber ot bloodypacks  
arms and accoutrements, thrown away in the  
road, and in the woods on each fide of it,—  
Besides which we ditcovered a number of re~  
cent graves, one of which has been since o­  
pened 3 containing the bodies o 1 twe persons  
*who had dted by wounds. These circum­  
flances, when added to that ot {5 many war­  
riors being left dead on the field, a circum­  
stance not common with Indians, were {uffi­  
cient to cßrroborate the womans declarae  
tion, and to prove what I before conjettured,  
that the loss of the enemy was much greater  
than was at firft apprebended. 1 Bave never  
been able to ascertain, with any degree of  
certainty, what force the enemy coppofed to  
us at Newion, but trom the beti accounts, I  
have been able to colleét, and from the o­  
pinion of General Poor and otbers, whe had  
the best opportunity of viewing their num­  
bers, as well from che extent of theirlines. I  
suppose them to have been 1500, thougfl the  
two pritoners, whom I believe totally igno­  
rant of the number at any post but their own,  
as well of the enemy,s ditpofition, eflima‘e  
them only atSoo while they allow that 5 com  
panies ot rangers, 2{i the warriors of beneea,  
and fix ciher nations we-e collefted at this  
place. lnoiderto deterrr_nine their force with  
as much accwracy 3s in my power, [ exami­  
ped their reatt works, and tound its extent  
more then half a mile, Severzl baitions ran .  
‘out ‘nits front to flank the lines, In every  
part.——A traall block houte fomerly 2  
dwetliing, alio manned in the front. i  
The breast-work appeared to have been ful­  
. ly manned, though I fuppoie with only one  
rank. Some part of their works being low,  
they were cbliged to dig holes in the ground  
to cover themielvesin part. This circum- «  
flance enabled me to judge the distance be­  
tween their men in the works. A very thin  
{cattering line, designed, as 1 suppose, tor  
communicating signals, was continued fiom  
those works to that part of the mountain  
which Géneral Poor ascended, where they  
had a very large body, which was designed °  
i imagine to tall on our flank. The distance  
from the breast- work toghis,was at least one  
mile and an half, From thence tothe hiilj  
in the rear of our right, was another scatter­  
ing line of about one mile, 2nd on the hill 2  
breast- work with z flrong pariy, deftired, as  
it is fupryted, to fall in our rear. But Ge­  
nera! Ciinton being ordered so far to the  
“right, occasioned hic flank to pass the moun­  
tain, which obliged them to abanden their  
post. From thoie circumstances, as weil as  
from theopinion of others,l cannot conceive  
their numbes to be less then what I have be­

» The army {pent one day at Catharine’s,  
in dellroying corn and fruit-irees, We burnt  
the town, confitting of*about 30 houses 5 and  
wiie next day encamped near a small {catter­  
ing {ettlement ot about 8 houtes, and in  
two days after reached Kendain, which we  
also tound deserted. Here oneof the inha­  
_ bitants of Woyming, who had been last year  
captured by ihe enemy, eicaped from them  
and joined us. He informed that the ene­  
my had left the townin the greatell contfu­  
fion, three days before our arzival. He {aid,  
&lt;he had converted with forme of the tories on  
their retuin irom the a&amp;tion of Newton, who  
assured him, they had great numbers tilled  
z2nd wounded,and there was no fafety butin  
flight. He heard Busler tell them, he must  
try ¢ make a fland alt Kanadafega ; but they’  
declared they would mot throw away their  
lives in vain attempt tooppofe such an army.  
He also heard many ot the Indian women la­  
menting the loss of their connexions ; and  
added, that Brandt had taken most of the  
wounded up the Teacga in water eraits,  
  
which had beeh provided for that purpose in  
case of neceflity, It was his opinicn the  
King of Kanadafega was kilied, as be saw  
‘him go down but not return, and gave a dif­  
criptioncf bisPer{on and dress correlpording  
with those of one found on thefield ot action.  
Kandain confificd of sbout 20 houles, which  
were reduced to ashes ;— the houles were  
~neatly built snd finithel, The army spent  
near a day at this place, in defiroying corn  
and fruit-trees, of which there was great 2=  
bundance ; many of the trees zppeared to  
be of great .ge. On the next day we crof=-  
fed the outlet of the Seneca inke, z2rd moved  
in three divisions through the weods, t 0 ens  
circle Kanadafega, bur tcund it likewise 2+  
bandoned. &#x27;A white child, of about 3 years  
old, ccubtlefs the o«ff pring of some unhappy  
captive, was found here, 2nd carried wiih  
the army. 4  
A detachment of 400 men was sent down  
on the wefl fide ot the lake, to dzfiroy Gothe  
feunqurau, and the plafitations in the fame  
quarters ; at the {ame time 2 nuraber of vo­  
lunteers, under Co!. Harper, made 2 forced  
march towards Cayuga lake, and defiroyed  
Schuyere, while the residue of the armywere  
employed in destroying the corn at Kanada­  
fegs, of which there was a large quantity.--  
This town consisted of, ¢o houses, and was  
pleasantly situated. In it we tound a great  
number of fruit-trees, which were defiroyed  
Jwiththe town. The army then moved on,  
and in two days arrived at Kenadaque, hav­  
ing been joined on the march by the detzch­  
ment (et along the Seneca-lake, which bad  
been almost two daysemployed in defiroying  
the crops and settlements in that quarier.—  
—At Kanaudaque we found 23 very elegant  
houses, mostly finifhed, 2nd in general large,  
Here we also destroyed very extensive fields  
of corn, which having been destroyed, we  
marched for Hanneyaye, 2 imall town of ten  
honfes, which we also destroyed.  
At this place we eftablithed a post, leaving  
a fhong garrison, our heavy flores, and ore  
field piece, and preeeeded to Chinefee.which  
the prisoners informed was the grand capi­  
_tal of the Indian country ; that Indians ot all  
nations had been planting there this {pring 3  
that all the rangers and some Britith had  
been employed in aflifting them, in order  
to raise {ufficient supplies to support them  
while defiroying our trontiers ; and that they  
themselves gad worked three weeks for the  
_lndians when planting. This information  
detérmined me at all events toreach that set­  
tlement, though the slate of my provisions,  
much reduced by unavoidable accidents, al­  
most forbad the attempt. My tlour had been  
_much reduced by the failie of pack horses,  
and in the passage of crecks and defiles ; and  
27 of the cattle had been unavoidably loft.--  
‘We, however, marched or tot the Chinelee  
town, and-on the second éay reacked a town  
of 25 houses, called Kanoghfaws. Here we  
found fonie lzrge eorn=fields, which part of  
the army defirsyed,while the other part were  
employed in building 2 bridge over an un­  
fordable creek between this snd Chinefee.  
I had the preceeding evenirg ordered out  
an officer with three or four riflemen, one  
of our guides, and anOneida Chief, to recon~  
noitre the Chinefee tcwn, that we might,if  
« possible furprize it.” Lieutenant Boid, of the  
rifle men, was the officer intrufted,who tock  
with him 23 men, volunteers from the fame  
corps, and a few from Col. Butler’s regiment,  
making in all 26, a much larger numbeg  
than 1 had thought of fending, ahd by no  
‘means {o likely to answer the purpose asthat  
which had been dire@ed. The guides were  
by no means acquainted wi&#x27;h the ccuntry,  
miflook the road in the night, and at day  
break fell in with a castle, fix miles higher  
up thanChinefee, inhzbited by a tribe called  
Squtehakes. Here they saw a few Indians,  
killed and fealped two, the ret flad. Two  
runners were immediately dispatched to me  
with the aceount, and informed that the par­  
ty were on their return. When the bridge  
was zlmoft compleated, some of them cama  
in 2nd informed, that Lieut. Boid, and most  
ot his party, werealmoft furronnded by the  
eacmy ;3 that the enemy bad been difcover~

Ang diviﬁens,@weg@%ate!y datached to  
their&#x27;relief ;- but arrived too late, the enemy  
having defiroyed the party and escaped.  
&lt;lt appeared that our men had taken to 2  
{ma!l grove of trees, the grotind around it be­  
ing clear on every fide for several rods, and  
there fought till Mr. Boid was thot through  
the body, and every man killed. except one,  
who with hiswounded commander,was mzde  
prisoner. The firing was so close before this  
brave party was defiroyed, that the powder  
of the enemy’s muskets wasdriven into their  
fleth. In this confliét the enemy muit have  
{uftered greatly, as they had no covert,znd  
our men were poffefled of a very advanta­  
geous one. This advantage of ground, the  
obstinate bravery oi%he party, with some o­  
ther circuffances, iuduced me to believe  
theirLofs must have been very considerable.  
—They were so long employed in removing  
and secreting theirdead, that the advancing­  
ot Gen. Hand’s partyobliged them toleave

ab&#x27;e them to 2&amp; with moie agility. in the  
field ; most of them appeared to have appur­  
tained to the rangers. Anotner reason which  
induces me to fappofe they fuffered much  
was, the unparilleied tortures they inflicted  
upon the brave znd uniortunzte Buid, whoie  
bedy, with that of the eguszlly urfortunate  
cumpanioir, we found at Chinefce. liap­  
peared they had whipped them in the moi  
cruel manner, pulled cutlMr, Boid’s.nails, cut  
off his mofe, plucked ont one of bis eyes, cut  
oui his tengue, stabbed him with {pears in  
fupdry places, and inflicted other tortures,  
which decency will not permit me o men­  
tion ; Iz2ftly, cut off his head, and left his  
body on the ground, with that of his unfor­  
tunite companien, who appeared to have  
experignced neafly the fame savage barba­  
\rity., ‘The party which, it seems, Mr. Boid  
fell in with, was oommanded by Butler, and  
12d been pofied on an advaniageous picce of

and after marcking fix miles we reached S(_l;‘ej

Leautifuily situated, almost encircled with 2

Tie 2rmy having been aavancing seventeen  
days with the {upply of provisions before

being as yet impenetrated, I thought it ne­  
cefl2ry to réttirn as foort as peffible, in order

nor to inclefe, Coungrels 5 they delivered me  
2 wneflage from the warriors of that nation  
reipecting the Cayugas ; copies of that and  
my answer, I also enclose. From tbis place­  
_J detached Col. Smith with a party downthe  
weil fide of the. lake, to defiroy the corn  
which had been cut down, and to destroy  
any thing further which might be difcover­

with 10¢.men toAlbany, to forward the bag

of fix or seven families, who were constant­  
ly employed in giving intelligence to the e­  
nemy,and in supporting their {couting par-.

When the Mohawks joined the enemy,thofe

the more considerable town of Kendaia, containing about twenty  
houses neatly built, and well finished. These were reduced to  
ashes, and the army spent nearly a day in destroying the fields of  
corn and the fruit-trees. Of these there were great abundance,  
and many of them appeared to be very ancient.  
  
“On the 7th of September, Sullivan crossed the outlet of the  
Seneca lake, and moved in three divisions upon the town of Kan-  
adaseagea—the Seneca capital—containing about sixty houses,  
with gardens, and numerous orchards of apple and peach trees. A  
detachment of four hundred men was sent down on the west side  
of the lake, to destroy Gotheseunquean, and the plantations in the  
neighborhood ; while at the same time a number of volunteers,  
under Colonel Harper, made a forced march in the direction of the  
Cayuga lake, and destroyed Schoyere. Meantime the residue of  
the army was employed, on the Sth, in the destruction cf the town,  
together with the fruit-trees, and fields of corn and beans. Here,  
as elsewhere, the work of destruction was thorough and com-  
  
lete.  
  
“The main army then moved forward upon Kanandaigua, at  
which place it arrived in two days. Here they ‘found twenty-three  
very elegant houses, mostly framed, and in general large,’ to-  
gether with very extensive fields of corn— all of which were de-  
stroyed. From Kanandaigua they proceeded to the small town  
of Honeoye, consisting of ten houses, which were immediately  
burnt to the ground. A post was established at Honeoye, to main-  
tain which a strong garrison was left, with the heavy stores and  
one field-piece. With this precautionary measure the army pre-  
pared to advance upon the yet more considerable town of Genesee  
— the great capital of the western tribes of the confederacy — con-  
taining their stores, and their broadest cultivated fields.” —Vo

wards reached the more considerable town of Kendaia, con-  
taining about twenty houses neatly built, and well finished.  
These were reduced to ashes, and the army spent nearly a  
day in destroying the fields of corn and the fruit trees. Of  
these there were great abundance, and many of them appear-

the Seneca lake, and moved in three re _ the town  
of Kanadaseagea—the Seneca capital—cuntaining about sixty

at which placo it arrived in two days. Here they found  
‘twenty-three very elegant houses, mostly framed, and in

which were i »mediately burnt ts the ground. A post was
