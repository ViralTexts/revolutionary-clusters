Monday July 1. 1776. A Resolution of the Convention of Maryland, passed the 28th. of June was laid before Congress and read: as follows: That the Instructions given to their Deputies in December last, be recalled, and the restrictions therein contained, removed, and that their Deputies be authorised to concur with the other Colonies, or a Majority of them, in declaring the United Colonies free and independent States: in forming a Compact between them; and in making foreign Alliances &amp;c.  
Resolved that Congress will resolve itself into a Committee of the whole to take into Consideration the Resolution respecting Independency.  
That the Declaration be referred to said Committee.  
The Congress resolved itself into a Committee of the whole. After some time The President resumed the Chair and Mr. Harrison reported, that the Committee had come to a Resolution, which they desired him to report and to move for leave to sit again.  
  
The Resolution agreed to by the Committee of the whole being read, the determination thereof, was at the Request of a Colony postponed till tomorrow.  
I am not able to recollect, whether it was on this, or some preceeding day, that the greatest and most solemn debate was had on the question of Independence. The Subject had been in Contemplation for more than a Year and frequent discussions had been had concerning it. At one time and another, all the Arguments for it and against it had been exhausted and were become familiar. I expected no more would be said in public but that the question would be put and decided. Mr. Dickinson however was determined to bear his Testimony against it with more formality. He had prepared himself apparently with great Labour and ardent Zeal, and in a Speech of great Length, and all his Eloquence, he combined together all that had before been written in Pamphlets and News papers and all that had from time to time been said in Congress by himself and others. He conducted the debate, not only with great Ingenuity and Eloquence, but with equal Politeness and Candour: and was answered in the same Spirit.  
No Member rose to answer him: and after waiting some time, in hopes that some one less obnoxious than myself, who had been all along for a Year before, and still was represented and believed to be the Author of all the Mischief, I determined to speak.  
It has been said by some of our Historians, that I began by an Invocation to the God of Eloquence. This is a Misrepresentation. Nothing so puerile as this fell from me. I began by saying that this was the first time of my Life that I had ever wished for the Talents and Eloquence of the ancient Orators of Greece and Rome, for I was very  sure that none of them ever had before him a question of more Importance to his Country and to the World. They would probably upon less Occasions than this have begun by solemn Invocations to their Divinities for Assistance but the Question before me appeared so simple, that I had confidence enough in the plain Understanding and common Sense that had been given me, to believe that I could answer to the Satisfaction of the House all the Arguments which had been produced, notwithstanding the Abilities which had been displayed and the Eloquence with which they had been enforced. Mr. Dickinson, some years afterwards published his Speech. I had made no Preparation beforehand and never committed any minutes of mine to writing. But if I had a Copy of Mr. Dickinsons before me I would now after Nine and twenty Years have elapsed, endeavour to recollect mine.  
Before the final Question was put, the new Delegates from New Jersey came in, and Mr. Stockton, Dr. Witherspoon and Mr. Hopkinson, very respectable Characters, expressed a great desire to hear the Arguments. All was Silence: No one would speak: all Eyes were turned upon me. Mr. Edward Rutledge came to me and said laughing, Nobody will speak but you, upon this Subject. You have all the Topicks so ready, that you must satisfy the Gentlemen from New Jersey. I answered him laughing, that it had so much the Air of exhibiting like an Actor or Gladiator for the Entertainment of the Audience, that I was ashamed to repeat what I had said twenty times before, and I thought nothing new could be advanced by me. The New Jersey Gentlemen however still insisting on hearing at least a Recapitulation of the Arguments and no other Gentleman being willing to speak, I summed up the Reasons, Objections and Answers, in as concise a manner as I could, till at length the Jersey Gentlemen said they were fully satisfied and ready for the Question, which was then put and determined in the Affirmative.

evotion to his country, and at  
his sincere religious principles, it is imposst i  
to doubt. He was not intended by Nature ferd  
great man, but placed by circumstances in a po.  
 sition which required both energy and insight,  
he acquitted himself of arduous duties wits  
credit. His connection with the progtess af  
democratic freedom in this country will alwars  
attach an interest to his name, and this willie  
gratified by the perusal of the reminiscences is  
the volumes now published.  
Under date of July, 1716, we find a description  
of John Adams&#x27;s share in the debate on  
THE DEcLAEATION oF iNnEpEnnENeE.  
I am not able to recollect whether it was on this  
or some proceeding day, that the greatest and mos;  
solemn debate was had on the question of indepen  
dence. The subject had been in contemplation  
more than a year, and trequent discussions had been  
had concerning it. At one time and another all the  
arguments for it and against it had been exhausted,  
and were become familiar. I expected no more  
would be said in pubite, but that the question woald  
be put and decided. Mr. Dickinson, however, wasde  
termmed to bear his testimony against it with more  
formality He had prepared himself apparently witt  
great labor and ardent real, and in a speechtof great  
length, and with all his eloquence, he combined to  
gether all that had before been written in pamphlets  
and newspapers, and all that had from time to time  
been said in Congress by himselt and others. fle  
conducted the debate not only with great ingenmy  
oaid eloquence, but with equal politeness and cander,  
and was aswered in the same spirit.  
No member rose to answer him, and after waiting  
some time, in hopes that some one less obnoxious  
than himself, who had been all along for a year ber  
fore, and still was, represented and believed to be  
the author of all the mischief, would move, I deter  
mined to speak.  
It has been said, by some of our historians, that I  
began by an invocation to the god of eloquence.  
This is a misrepresentation. Nothing so puerile as  
this fell from me. I began, by saying that this was  
the first time of my life that I had ever wished for  
the talents and eloquence of the ancient orators of  
Greece and Rome, for I was sure that none of them  
ever had before him a question of more importance  
to his countrymen and to the world. They woull  
probably, upon less occasions than this, have begu  
by solemn invocations to their divinities for as­  
sistance, but the question before me appeared so  
simple, that I had contidence enough in the plala  
understanding and common sense that had been  
given me, to believe that I could answer, to the  
satisfaction of the House, all the arguments which  
had been produced, notwithstanding the abilities  
which had been displayed, and the etoquence with  
which they had been enforced. Mr. Dickinson,  
some years afterward, pusiished his speech. I hat  
made no preparation beforehand, and never com­  
mitted any minutes of mine to writing. But if I  
had a copy of Mr. Dickinson&#x27;s before me, I would

in the opening of his speech referred to Mr.  
Adams as having commenced his by invoking  
a heathen god, the god of Eloquence.”  
  
Mr. Adams, in his autobiography, does not  
determine with certainty the day that this de-  
bate, “ the greatest and most solemn debate  
was had on the question of independence,” but  
refers to it under the date of July 1. On the  
10th of June the further consideration of the  
question was postponed to that day. By this  
postponement those on both sides disposed to  
take the lead, or to take part in the debate  
on the first of July, had full time to prepare  
for it.  
  
Mr. Adams, who did not expect much dis-  
  
397  
cussion, but that without it the question would  
be put and decided, had prepared no notes or  
references. But, he says, “Dr. Dickinson,  
however, determined to bear his testimony  
against it with more formality. He had pre-  
pared himself apparently with great labor and  
ardent zeal, and in a speech of great length,  
and with all his eloquence, he combined to-  
gether all that had before been written in  
—- and newspapers, and all that had  
  
fore, from time to time, been said in Con-  
gress by himself and others.”  
  
After Mr. Dickinson had concluded, no one  
else offering to take the floor, Mr. Adams says,  
“IT determined to speak. It has been said  
by some historians that I began by an invoca-  
tion to the god of Eloquence. This is a mis-  
representation. Nothing so puerile fell from  
me.”  
  
The facts then appear to be that Mr. Ad-  
ams did not speak first, but that Mr. Dickin-  
son opened the debate, and the speech of Mr

I am not able to recollect whether it was on this or some pre¬  
ceding day, that the greatest and most solemn debate was had on  
the question of independence. The subject had been in contem¬  
plation for more than a year, and frequent discussions had been  
had eoneeming it. At one time and another all the arguments  
for it and against it had been exhausted, and were become famil¬  
iar. I expected no more would be said in public, but that the  
question would be put and decided. Mr. Dickinson, however,  
was determined to hear his testimony against it with more for¬  
mality. He had prepared himself apparently with great labor  
and ardent zeal, and, in a speech of great length, and with all his  
eloquence, he combined together all that had before been written  
in pamphlets and newspapers, and all-that had from time to time  
been said in Congress by himself and others. He conducted the  
debate not only with great ingenuity and eloquence, but with  
equal |M&gt;liteness and candor, and was answered in the same spirit.  
No meml&gt;er rose to answer him, and after waiting some time in  
hopes that some one less obnoxious than himself, who had been  
all along for a year before, and still was represented and believed  
to l&gt;e the author of all the mischief, would move, I determined to  
speak. It has been said bv some of our historians that I began  
by an invocation 1o the god of eloquence. This is a misrepresen¬  
tation. Nothing so puerile as this fell from me. I l&gt;egan by say¬  
ing, that this was the first time of my life that I had ever wished  
for the talents and eloquence of the ancient orators of Greece and  
Borne, for I was sure that none of them ever had before him a  
question of more importance to his countrymen and to the world.  
They would probably, upon less occasions than this, have beguti  
by solemn invocation to their divinities for assistance; but the  
(piestioii before me appeared so simple that I had confidence  
enough in the plain understanding atid common sense that had  
l*ecn given me, to believe that I could answer to the satisfaction of  
the House all the arguments which hud been produced, notwill.-  
standing the abilities which had Itccn displayed and the eloquence  
with which thev had Itecn enforced. Mr. Dickinson, some years  
afterward, piibfishcd his speech. I had made no preparation be¬  
forehand, and never committed any minutes of mine to writing.  
But if I had a copy of Mr. DickiusW’s before me, I would now,  
after nine and twenty years have elapsed, endeavor to recollect  
mine. Before the final question was put, the new delegates from  
New Jersey came in, and Mr. Stockton, Dr. Witherspoon, and

Mr. Hojikinson, very respectable chnmetcrs, expressed a great  
desire to hear the arguments. All was silence; no one would  
speak; all eyes a-ere turned upon me. Mr. Edward Rutledge  
came to roc and said, laughingly, “ Nobodv will speak but vuii  
upon this subject. You have all the topics so ready, that you  
must satisfy the gentlemen from New Jersey.” I answered him,  
laughing, that it had so much the air of exhibiting like an actor  
nr gladiator, for the entertainment of the audience, that I was  
ashamed to rejieat what I had said twenty times liefore, and I  
thought nothing new could lie advanced by me. The New Jersey  
gentlemen, however, still insisting on hearing at least a recapitula¬  
tion of the arguments, and no other gentleman being willing to  
speak, I summed up the reasons, objections and answers in as  
conci.se a manner as 1 could, till at length the Jersey gentlemen  
said they were fullv satisfied and readv for the question, which  
was then put and determined in the uftinnativc.— Diary of John

ancient orators of Greece and Rome, for I am very

Many members followed. When the debate  
had proceeded for a long time, three new members  
from New Jersey came in; Richard Stockton,

Again there was an awkward silence. Again |

satisfy the gentlemen from New Jersey.”  
  
Mr. Adams replied that he was ashamed to re-

the new members still insisted on hearing a recapit-
