ll find probably that he does not know even that of the one he comes from.  
			 you  
			 will ask perhaps where are the proofs of these preparations for one who cannot go &amp; see  
			 them. I answer, in the acts of Congress authorising such preparations, &amp; in your knolege of me that, if authorised, they would be executed.  
			 two  
			 measures have not been adopted which I pressed on Congress repeatedly at their meetings. the one, to settle the whole ungranted territory of Orleans by donations of land to able bodied young men, to be engaged &amp; carried there at the public expence, who would constitute a force always ready on the spot to defend New Orleans.the  
			 other was to class the militia according to the years of their birth, &amp; make all those from 20. to 25. liable to be trained &amp; called into service at a moment’s warning. this  
			 would have given us a force of 300,000. young men, prepared by proper training for service in any part of the US. while those who had passed thro’ that period would remain at home liable to be used in their own or adjacent states. these two  
			 measures would have compleated what I deemed necessary for the  
			 entire security of our country. they would have given me, on  
			 my retirement from the government, of the nation, the consolatory reflection that having  
			 found, when I was called to it, not a single seaport town in a condition to repel a levy of contribution by a single privateer or pirate,  
			 I had left every harbor so prepared by works &amp;  
			 gunboats  
			 as to be in a reasonable state of security against any probable attack,  
			 the  
			 territory of Orleans acquired &amp; planted with an internal force sufficient for it’s protection, &amp; the whole territory of the US. organised by such a classification of it’s male force as would give it the benefit of all it’s young population for active service, and that of a middle &amp; advanced age for stationary  
			 defence.  
			 but these measures will, I hope, be compleated by my successor, who, to the purest principles of republican patriotism, adds a wisdom &amp; foresight second to no man on earth.  
So much as to my country. now a word as to myself. I am retired to Monticello, where, in the bosom of my family, &amp; surrounded by my books, I enjoy a repose to which I have been long a stranger.  
			 my  
			 mornings are devoted to correspondence.  
			 from breakfast to  
			 dinner I  
			 am in my shops, my garden, or on horseback among my farms; from dinner to dark I give to society &amp; recreation with my neighbors &amp; friends;  
			 &amp;  
			 from candlelight to early bed-time I read.  
			 my  
			 health is perfect; and my strength considerably reinforced by the activity of the course I pursue; perhaps it is as great as usually falls to the lot of near 77   
67. years of age. I

ciusko, on the 26th of February, 1810: Two  
measures have not been adopted which I press­  
ed upon Congress repeatedly at their meetings.  
T he one to settle the whole ungranted territo­  
ry of Orleans, by donations of land to able-bodied  
young men. to b? engaged ind carried there at  
the public expense, who would constitute a force  
always ready on the spot to defend New Orleans.  
The other was to class the maliua, according, to  
the year of their birth, and make all those from  
twenty to tvventv-five. liable to be trained and  
called&#x27; into service at a moment&#x27;s warning. - This  
would have given us a force of three hundred  
thousand young men, prepared by proper train­  
ing for service in any pari of the United Stales ;  
while those who had passed through that period  
would remain at home, liable to be used in their  
own or adjacent Stales. These two measures  
woulJ have completed what I deemed necessary  
for tbe entire security of our country. They  
would have given me on my retirement from the  
government of the nation, the consolatory reflec­  
tions, that having found when I was called to it,  
not a single seaport town in a condition to repel  
a levy of contribution by a single privateer or  
pirate, I had left every harbor so prepared by  
works and gun-boats, as to be in a reasonable  
state of security against any probable attack;  
the territory of Orleans acquired and planted,  
with an internal force suffi tierit for its protection;  
and the whole territory of the United States or  
ganized by such a classification ot its male lorce,  
as would gwe it the benefit of all its young pop­  
ulation for active service, and that of a middle

these measures will, I hope, be completed by

did not profit by tho management of his  
estate, and generally retired fatigued, but  
happy. Ho thus described his daily hab­  
its of life in a letter to Koskiuco, who was  
also the cultivator of a small estate:  
“My mornings are devoted to correspon­  
dence. From breakfast to dinner lam in  
my shops, my garden, or on horseback  
among my farms; from dinner to dark I  
j give to society and recreation with my  
I neighbors and friends, and from candle  
light to bedtime I rend. My health is  
perfect, and my strength considerably re­  
inforced by the activity of the course 1  
pursue; perhaps it is as falls to the  
lot of man near sixty-seven years of age.  
1 talk of plows and harrows, of seeding  
and harvesting, with my neighbors, and of  
politics, too, if they choose, with us little  
  
reserve as the rest of my fellow citizens,  
and feel, at length, the blessing of being  
free to say arid do what I please, without  
being responsible for it to any mortal. A  
part of my occupation, and by no means  
the least pleasing, is the direction of the  
studies of such young men as ask it.  
They place themselves in the neighboring  
village, and have the use of my library and  
counsel. In advising the course of their  
rending, I endeavor to keep their attention  
tixed on the main objects of all science,  
the freedom and happiness of men. So  
that, coming to bear a share in the coun­  
cils and government of their country, they  
will keep over in view the sole object of  
all legitimate&#x27;government. Instead of the  
unalloyed happiness of retiring unembar­  
rassed and independent to the enjoyment  
of my estate, which is ample fur my lim­  
ited views, I have to pass such a length of  
time in a thraldom of mind CCYcf before  
known to me. Except for this, my hap­  
piness would have been perfect. That  
yours may never know disturbance, and  
that you may enjoy as many years of life,  
health and ease us yourself shall wish, is  
the sincere prayer of your constant and  
affectionate friend.

the fortifications of the seaboard in a letter  
to Koscrusko. &quot;Two measures,&quot; he wrote,  
&quot;have not been adopted which I pressed on  
Congress repeatedly. One was to settle the  
whole ungranted territory of New Orleans  
by donations of land to able-bodied young  
men, to be engaged and carried there  
at the public expense, who would consti­  
tute a force always ready on the spot to  
defend New Orleans. The other was to  
class the militia according to the years of  
their birth, and make all those from twenty  
to twenty-five liable to be drawn and called  
into active service at a moment&#x27;s notice.&quot;  
These two measures were, in Jefferson&#x27;s  
judgment, necessary for an entire security  
of the country at that time. Respecting  
the fortifications of the coast, he said to  
KosciuskO: &quot;When I was called to the  
Presidency, not a single seaport town was  
in a condition to repel a levy of contribu­

every harbor so prepared by works and gun­  
boats as to be in a reasonable state of secur­
