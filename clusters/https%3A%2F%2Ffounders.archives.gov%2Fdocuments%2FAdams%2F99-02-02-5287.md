own country and left others to take care of theirs. His refinements were not invisible. His negociations were very like those of the British Cabinet with us at this day. All I have to say is, that all European Cabinets and Ministers are very much alike: and our only security against them is in our own fortitude and the sense and integrity of our own Ministers. Have you seen any wondrous skill in our foreign Ambassadors for some years past ?  
I have sent to the Indian Queen the 2d and 3d vols. of a work which the English editor of the 2d edition calls an History of Republicks. It may be called The American Boudoir. What is a Boudoir? It is a Pouting room. And what is a Pouting room? In many gentlemen’s houses in France, there is an apartment, of an octagonal form, twelve or fifteen feet across, or thirty six or forty-five feet round, and all the eight sides, as well as the ceiling over head, are all of the most polished glass Mirrors: so that, when a man stands in the centre of the room he sees himself in every direction, multiplied into a row of selfs, as far as the eye can reach.  
The humour of it is, that when the lady of the house is out of temper, when she is angry, or when she weeps without a cause, she may be locked up in this chamber to pout, and to see in every direction how beautiful she is. There are settees and chairs round the sides and commonly a bath in the centre, which may be made hot or cold. So that persons may see themselves naked in every posture. Such a Boudoir is the Defence. Our States may see themselves in it, in every possible light, attitude and movement. They may see all their beauties and all their deformities. Happy they who are made cautious by others’ dangers!  
I return the editor’s letter, which, with a thousand other things, concurs to show that certain presses are under the controul of an aristocracy of bankers led by the nose by an oligarchy of Shylocks, all sycophants to Britain. A happy new year.

description of a Boudoir: &quot;What is a Boudoir?  
It is a Pouting Room. And what is a Pouting  
Room? In many gentlemen&#x27;s houses in France  
there is an apartment of an octagonal form, twelve  
or fifteen feet across, thirty-six or forty-five round,  
and all of the eight sides, as well as the ceiling  
above, are all of the most polished glass mirrors; so  
that when a man stands in the center of the room,  
he sees himself in every direction, multiplied into  
a row of selfs, as far as the eye can extend. The  
humor of it is, that when the lady of the house is  
out of temper, when she is angry, or when she  
weeps without a cause, she may he locked up in  
this chamber to pout, and see, in every direction  
how beautiful she is.

Human Natithk.?Human nature is the same  
in all reasonable crentures; and whatever falls  
in with it will meet admirers amongst readers  
of all qualities and conditions. Moliere, as we  
are told by Monsieur Boileau, used to read all  
his comedies to an old woman, who was his  
housekeeper, as she sat with him at her work  
by the chimney-corner; and could foretell the  
success of his play in the theatre, from the re­  
ception It met at his fireside; for he tells us  
the audience always followed the old woman,  
and never failed to laugh in the same place.
