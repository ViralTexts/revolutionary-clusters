Gentlemen,  
[c.13 October 1789]  
  
I receive with pleasure your affectionate address, and thank you for the friendly Sentiments &amp; good wishes which you express for the Success of my administration, and for my personal Happiness.  
We have Reason to rejoice in the prospect that the present National Government, which by the favor of Divine Providence, was formed by the common Counsels, and peaceably established with the common consent of the People, will prove a blessing to every denomination of them. To render it such, my best endeavours shall not be wanting.  
Government being, among other purposes, instituted to protect the Persons and Consciences of men from oppression, it certainly is the duty of Rulers, not only to abstain from it themselves, but according to their Stations, to prevent it in others.  
The liberty enjoyed by the People of these States, of worshipping Almighty God agreable to their Consciences, is not only among the choicest of their Blessings, but also of their Rights—While men perform their social Duties faithfully, they do all that Society or the State can with propriety demand or expect; and remain responsible only to their Maker for the Religion or modes of faith which they may prefer or profess.  
Your principles &amp; conduct are well known to me—and it is doing the People called Quakers no more than Justice to say, that (except their declining to share with others the burthen of the common defence) there is no Denomination among us who are more exemplary and useful Citizens.  
I assure you very explicitly that in my opinion the Consciencious scruples of all men should be treated with great delicacy &amp; tenderness, and it is my wish and desire that the Laws may always be as extensively accomodated to them, as a due regard to the Protection and essential Interests of the Nation may Justify, and permit.

GENTLEMEN, I receive with pleasure your

friendly sentiments and good wishes which  
you express for the success of my administra-

We have reason to rejoice in the prospect  
that the present national government, which,

lished with the common consent of the peo-  
ple, will prove a blessing to every denomina-  
tion of them ;—to render it such, my best en-  
deavors shall not be wanting.  
  
Government being among other purposes  
instituted to protect the persons and con-  
sciences of men from oppression,—it certainly  
is the duty of rulers, not only to abstain from  
it themselves, but according to their stations  
to prevent it in others.  
  
The liberty enjoyed by the people of these  
States, of worshipping Almighty God agree-  
able to their consciences, is not only among  
the choicest of their blessings, but also of their  
  
| rights. While men perform their social du-  
| ties faithfully, they doall that Society or the  
State can with propriety demand or expect,  
and remain responsible only to their Maker  
for the religion or mode of faith, which they

Your principles and conduct are well  
known to me; and it is doing the people  
called Quakers no more than justice to  
say, that (except their declining to share

opinion, the consciencious scruples of all men

tenderness ; and it is my wish and desire, that

To this kind and affectionate but uncompromising ad-

To the Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends :  
I receive with pleasure your affectionate address, and  
  
thank you for the friendly sentiment and good wishes  
which you express for the success of my administration,  
  
and for my personal happiness.  
  
We reason to in the prospect that the  
present national government, which by the favor of  
Divine Providence was formed by the common counsels,  
and peaceably established with the common consent of  
the people, will prove a blessing to every religious de-  
  
render it such my best en-  
  
have

nomination of them, and to  
deavors shall not be wanting.  
  
Government being among other purposes instituted  
to protect the persons and consciences of men from op-  
pression, it certainly is the duty of rulers, not only to  
abstain from it themselves, but according to their sta-  
tions to prevent it in others.

duties faithfully, they do all that society or the State can

Your principles and conduct are well known to me,  
and it is doing the people called Quakers no more than  
justice to say that (except their declining to share wit!  
others the burden of the common defense) there is no  
denomination among us who are more exemplary and  
useful citizens.  
  
I assure you very explicitly, that in my opinion the  
conscientious scruples of all men should be treated with  
great delicacy and tenderness ; and it is my wish and de-
