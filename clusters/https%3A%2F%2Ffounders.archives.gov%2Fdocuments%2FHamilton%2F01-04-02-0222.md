mentioned as the second requisite to the energy of the executive authority. This has relation to two objects: To the personal firmness of the Executive Magistrate in the employment of his constitutional powers; and to the stability of the system of administration which may have been adopted under his auspices. With regard to the first, it must be evident, that the longer the duration in office, the greater will be the probability of obtaining so important an advantage. It is a general principle of human nature, that a man will be interested in whatever he possesses, in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure, by which he holds it; will be l

. The inference from it is, that a man acting in the capacity of Chief Magistrate, under a consciousness, that in a very short time he must lay down his office, will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it, to hazard any material censure or perplexity, from the independent exertion of his powers, or from encountering the ill-humors, however transient, which may happen to prevail either in a considerable part of the society itself, or even in a predominant faction in the legislative body. If the case should only be, that he might lay it down, unless continued by a new choice; and if he should be desirous of being continued, his wishes conspiring with his fears would tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity, or debase his fortitude. In either case feebleness and irresolution must be the characteristics of the station.  
There are some, who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of the executive to a prevailing current, either in the community, or in the Legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain very crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was instituted, as of the true means by which the public happiness may be promoted. The republican principle demands, that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they entrust the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breese of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests. It is a just observation, that the people commonly intend the PUBLIC GOOD. This often applies to their very errors. But their good sense would despise the adulator, who should pretend that they always reason right about the means of promoting it. They know from experience, that they sometimes err; and the wonder is, that they so seldom err as they do; beset as they continually are by the wiles of parasites and sycophants, by the snares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate; by the artifices of men, who possess their confidence more than they deserve it, and of those who seek to possess, rather than to deserve it. When occasions present themselves in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests, to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection. Instances might be cited, in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes, and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men, who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure.  
  
But however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded complaisance in the executive to the inclinations of the people, we can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of the Legislature. The latter may sometimes stand in opposition to the former; and at other times the people may be entirely neutral. In either supposition, it is certainly desirable that the executive should be in a situation to dare to act his own opinion with vigor and decision.  
The same rule, which teaches the propriety of a partition between the various branches of power, teaches us likewise that this partition ought to be so contrived as to render the one independent of the other. To what purpose separate the executive, or the judiciary, from the legislative, if both the executive and the judiciary are so constituted as to be at the absolute devotion of the legislative? Such a separation must be merely nominal and incapable of producing the ends for which it was established. It is one thing to be subordinate to the laws, and another to be dependent on the legislative body. The first comports with, the last violates, the fundamental principles of good government; and whatever may be the forms of the Constitution, unites all power in the same hands. The tendency of the legislative authority to absorb every other, has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples, in some preceding numbers. In governments purely republican, this tendency is almost irresistable. The representatives of the people, in a popular assembly, seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people themselves; and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter; as if the exercise of its rights by either the executive or judiciary, were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity. They often appear disposed to exert an imperious controul over the other departments; and as they commonly have the people on their side, they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the Constitution.  
It may perhaps be asked how the shortness of the duration in office can affect the independence of the executive on the legislature, unless the one were possessed of the power of appointing or displacing the other? One answer to this enqui

h to justify any alarm for the public liberty. If a British House of Commons, from the most feeble beginnings, from the mere power of assenting or disagreeing to the imposition of a new tax, have by rapid strides, reduced the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobility within the limits they conceived to be compatible with the principles of a free government; while they raised themselves to the rank and consequence of a coequal branch of the Legislature; if they have been able in one instance to abolish both the royalty and the aristocracy, and to overturn all the ancient establishments as well in the church as State; if they have been able on a recent occasion to make the monarch tremble at the prospect of an innovation

should govern tbe conduct of those to  
wbom they entrust tbe management of their  
affairs ; but it does not require an unqual­  
ified complaisance to evury sudden breeze  
of passion, or to every transient impulse  
which the people may receive from the arts  
of men who flatter their prejudices to be­  
tray? their interests. It is a just observa­  
tion tbat tbe people generally intend thi  
publiegood. This often applies to their  
?ery errors. But their good sense would  
despise the adulator wbo Bbould pretend  
that they would always reason right about  
the means of promoting it. Tbey know  
from experience that tbey sometimes err;  
audi the wonder is that they so seldom ei r  
as they do, beset, as tbey continually are,  
by ^be wiles of parasites and sycophants ;  
by ^he snares of the ambitious, the avari­  
cious, tbe desperate; by the artifices of  
men wbo possess their confidence mom  
than they deserve it; and of those who seek  
to possess it rather than to ?????? ?r  
wnen occasions present themselves in  
which the interests of tbe people are at  
variance with their inclinations, it is the  
duty of tbe persons whom they have per­  
mitted to be tbe guardians ot those inter­  
ests, to withstand the temporary delusion,  
in order to give them time and opportunity  
for more cool nod sedate reflection. In­  
stances might be cited iu which a conduct  
of this kiud has saved the people from  
very fatal consequences of their own mis­  
takes, and has procured lasting monuments  
of gratitude to the men who bad courage  
and magnanimity enough to strve at the  
peril of their displeasure.&#x27;*

&quot;The samo rulo which teaches the  
propriety of a partition between the

likewise that this partition ought to  
be so contrived as to render the one  
independent of thc. other. To &quot;what  
purpose separate the executive or the

the executive and the judiciary are  
so constituted as to bc at the absolute

separation must be merely Dominai,

 their words.  
The chief complaint against President Johnson is that  
he disregards the popular will, as expressed by Con-  
gress. An appeal to the Constitution in the case is  
treated with contempt, and party organs do not hesi-  
tate to scout the Constitution as in effect obsolete.  
How different all this is from the convictions and the  
spirit of those who framed the Constitution and organ-  
ized the government does not need to be said. A sin-  
gle passage from Alexander Hamilton will reveal at a  
glance the extent of the departure from the faith of the  
fathers. In No. 70 of The Federalist he says:  
  
“There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy  
of the executive to a prevailing current, either in the community or in the  
legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain very  
crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was institut-  
ed, as of the true means by which the public happiness may be promoted.  
When occasions present themselves in which the interests of the people are  
at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of the persons whom they  
have appointed to be the guardians of those interests to withstand the tem-  
porary delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool  
and sedate reflection. . But, however inclined we might be to in-  
sist upon an unbounded complaisance in the executive to the inclinations  
of the people, we can with no propriety contend for a like complaisance  
tothe humors of the legislature. The latter may sometimes stand in oppo-  
sition tothe former ; and at other times the people may be entirely neutral,  
In either supposition it is certainly desirable that the executive should  
be in a situation to dare toact his own opinion with vigor and decision.”  
  
The doctrine now is, that it is the sole duty of the  
President to execute the laws Congress has made,  
whether he deems them conformable to the Constitu-  
tion or not. If Congress shall pass an act taking  
from the President the veto power, and declaring th

says :—  
  
If a British House of Commions, from the most feeble beginnings, from  
the mere power of assenting or disagreeing to the imposition of a new tax,  
have, by rapid strides, reduced the prerogatives of the Crown, and the  
privileges of the nobility, within the limits they conceived to be compatible  
with the principles of a free government, while they raised themselves to  
the rank and consequence of a co-equal branch of the legislature ; if they  
have been able, in one instance, to abolish both the royalty and the aristo-  
cracy, and to overturn all the ancient establishments, as well in the church  
as state ; if they have been able, on a recent occasion, to make the monarch  
tremble at the prospect of an innovation* attempted by them, what would  
be to be feared from an elective magistrate of four years’ duration, with  
the confined authorities of a President of the United States? What but

most probable cause of dry-rot in the American constitution,  
the possibility of the President allowing himself to swerve from  
what he should believe to be the path of duty, through a timid  
respect for the collective wisdom of the Commons. He says

There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of  
the executive to a prevailing current, either in the community, or in the  
legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain very  
crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was insti-  
tuted, as of the true means by which the public happiness may be pro-  
moted. The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the  
community should govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust the  
management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified com-  
plaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient impulse  
which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter their pre-  
judices to betray their interests. * * * When occasions present themselves  
in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations,  
it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed, to be the guardians  
of those interests; to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give  
them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection. Instances  
might be cited, in which a conduct of this kind has saved the people from  
very fatal consequences of their own mistakes, and has procured lasting  
monuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magna-  
nimity enough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure.  
  
But however inclined we might be to insist upon an unbounded com-  
plaisance in the executive to the inclinations of the people, we can, with  
no propriety, contend for a like complaisance to the humours of the legis-  
lature. The latter may sometimes stand in opposition to the former ; and  
at other times the people may be entirely neutral. In either supposition,  
it is certainly desirable that the executive should be ina situation to dare  
to act his own opinion with vigour and decision.t

It was written while the Convention  
was in session, and with the design of  
counteracting any bad influence; from  
the excited passions of the period. Said  
he:  
&quot;The Republican principle demands  
that the deliberate sense of the commu­  
nity should govern the conduct of those  
to whj__l they intrust the management  
of their affairs ; but it does not require  
an unqualified complaisance to every  
sudden breeze of passion, or to every  
transient impulse which the people may  
receive from the arts of men who flatter  
their prejudices to betray their interests.  
It is a just observation that the people  
commonly intend the public good. This  
often applies to their very errors. But  
their good sense would despise the adu­  
lator who should pretend that they al­  
ways reason right about the means of  
promoting it. They know from expe­  
rience that they sometimes err; and the  
wonder is that they so seldom err as  
they do, beset as they continually are,  
by the wiles of parasites and sycophants;  
by the snares of the ambitious, the ava­  
ricious, the desperate; by the artifices of  
men who possess their confidence more  
than they deserve it. When occasions  
present themselves in which the inter­  
ests of the people are at variance with  
th eir inclinations, it is the duty of per­  
sons whom they have appointed to be  
guardians of those interests to withstand  
the temporary delusion, in order to give  
them time and opportunity for more  
cool and sedate reflection. Instances  
might be cited in which a conduct of  
this kind has saved the people from very  
fatal consequences of their own mistakes  
and has procured lasting monuments of  
their gratitude to the men who had  
courage and magnanimity enough to

tured to propose restrictions on the tyranny of  
legislative majorities by the veto power, be­  
cause he was resolutely opposed to destruction,  
and thus advocated them in Federalist, No, 71:  
There are some who would be inclined to regard  
the servile pliancy of the Executive to a prevailing  
current, either in the community or in the Legisla  
ture, as its best recommendation. But such men  
entertain very crude notions, as well of the purpose  
for which government was instituted as of the  
true means by which the public happiness may be  
promoted. The Republican principle demands  
that the deliberative sense of the community should  
govern the conduct of those to whom they intrust  
the managements of their affairs, but it does not  
require an unqualified complaisance to every sud­  
den breeze of passion or to every transient im­  
pulse which the people may receive from the arts  
of men who flatter their prejudices to betray their  
interests, It is a just observation that the people in­  
tend the public good. This often applies to their very  
errors. But their good sense would despise the  
adulator who should pretend that they would al­  
ways reason right about the means of promoting it.  
They know from experience that they sometimes  
err, and the wonder is that they so seldom orr as  
they do, beset as they continually are by the wiles  
of parasites and sycophants; by the snares of the  
ambitious, the avaricious, the desperate; by the  
artifices of men who possess their confidence more  
than they deserve it, and of those who seek to  
possess rather than to deserve it. When occasions  
present themselves in which the interests of the  
people are at variance with their inclinations it is  
the duty of persons whom they have appointed to  
be the guardians of those interests, to withstand  
the temporary delusion in order to give them time  
and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.  
Instances might be cited in which a conduct of  
this kind has saved the people from very fatal con­  
sequences of their own mistakes, and has procured  
lasting monuments of their gratitdide to the men  
who had courage and magnanimity enough to  
serve at the peril of their displeasur

ments of the latter, a revolution will be in-  
evitable.” In the same vein Hamilton wrote  
in the Federalist :  
  
‘The tendency of the legislative authority  
to absorb every other has been fully displayed  
and illustrated. In governments purely re-  
publican this tendency is almost irresistible.  
The representatives of the people, in a popu-  
lar assembly, seem sometimes to fancy that  
they are the people themselves, and betray  
strong symptoms of impatience and disgust  
at the least sign of opposition from any other  
quarter; as if the exercise of its rights, by  
either the executive or judiciary, “were a  
breach of their privilege and an outrage to  
their dignity. They often appear disposed  
to exert an imperious control over the other  
departments; and as they commonly have  
the people on their side, they always act with  
such momentum as to make it very difficult  
for the other members of the Government to  
maintain the balance of the Constitution.”

With the position which Mr. Cleveland
