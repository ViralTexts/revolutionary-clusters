.  
In a letter of last year to the best of my recollection, I informed  
  
you of the motives, which compelled me to allot a day for the reception of idle and ceremonious visits (for it never has prevented those of sociability and friendship in the afternoon, or at any other time) but if I am mistaken in this, the history of this business is simply and shortly as follows—Before the custom was established, which now accommodates foreign characters, Strangers, and others who from motives of curiosity, respect, to the Chief Magistrate, or any other cause, are induced to call upon me—I was unable to attend to any business whatsoever; for Gentlemen, consulting their own convenience rather than mine, were calling from the time I rose from breakfast—often before—until I sat down to dinner—This, as I resolved not to neglect my public duties, reduced me to the choice of one of these alternatives, either to refuse them altogether, or to appropriate a time for the reception of them—The first would, I well knew, be disgusting to many—The latter, I expected, would undergo animadversion, and blazoning from those who would find fault, with, or without cause. To please every body was impossible—I therefore adopted that line of conduct which combined public advantage with private convenience, and which in my judgment was unexceptionable in itself. That I have not been able to make bows to the taste of poor Colonel Bland, (who by the by I believe never saw one of them) is to be regretted especially too as (upon those occasions) they were indiscriminately bestowed, and the best I was master of—would it not have been better to have thrown the veil of charity over them, ascribing their stiffness to the effects of age, or to the unskilfulness of my teacher, than to pride and dignity of office, which God knows has no charms for me? for I can truly say I had rather be at Mount Vernon with a friend or two about me, than to be attended at the Seat of Government by the Officers of State and the Representatives of every Power in Europe—These visits are optional—They are made without invitation—Between the hours of three and four every Tuesday I am prepared to receive them—Gentlemen—often in great numbers—come and go—chat with each other—and act as they please. A Porter shews them into the room, and they retire from it when they please, and without ceremony. At their first entrance they salute me, and I them, and as many as I can talk to I do—what pomp there is in all this I am unable to discover—Perhaps it consists in not sitting—To this two reasons  
  
are opposed, first it is unusual—secondly, (which is a more substantial one) because I have no room large enough to contain a third of the chairs, which would be sufficient to admit it—If it is supposed that ostentation, or the fashions of courts (which by the by I believe originates oftener in convenience, not to say necessity than is generally imagined) gave rise to this custom, I will boldly affirm that no supposition was ever more erroneous; for, if I was to give indulgence to my inclinations, every moment that I could withdraw from the fatigues of my station should be spent in retirement—That they are not proceeds from the sense I entertain of the propriety of giving to every one as free access, as consists with that respect which is due to the chair of government—and that respect I conceive is neither to be acquired or preserved but by observing a just medium between much state and too great familiarity.  
Similar to the above, but of a more familiar and sociable kind are the visits every friday afternoon to Mrs Washington where I always am—These public meetings and a dinner once a week to as many as my table will hold with the references to and from the different Departments of State, and other communications with all parts of the Union is as much, if not more, than I am able to undergo, for I have already had within less than a year, two severe attacks—the last worse than the first—a third more than probable will put me to sleep with my fathers; at what distance this may be I know not. Within the last twelve months I have undergone more, and severer sickness tha

As to levees, take the explanation of  
Washington himself, in a letter to a friend  
—the 5th vol. of his life, page 165. “ Be­  
fore the custom was established which now  
accommodates foreign characters, stran­  
gers, and others who from motives of curi­  
osity, respect to the chief magistrate, or  
any other cause, are induced to call upon  
me, I was unable to attend to any business  
whatsoever For gentlemen consulting their  
own convenience rather than mine, were  
calling from the time I rose from breakfast  
—often before—until I sat down to dinner.  
This, as I resolved not to neglect my pub­  
lic duties, reduced me to the choice of one  
of these alternatives ; either to refuse them  
altogether, or to appropriate a time for the  
reception of them. The first I knew would  
be disgusting to many ; the latter I expect­  
ed would undergo animadversion from  
those who would find fault with or without  
cause. To please all was impossible. 1  
therefore adopted that line of conduct  
which combined public advantage with  
private convenience, and which in my judg­
