Your successful endeavours my Dr Marqs, to promote the interests of your two Countries (as you justly call them) must give you the most unadulterated satisfaction: be assured the measures which have been lately taken with regard to the two Articles of Oil &amp; Tobacco, have tended very much to endear you to your fellow Citizens on this side of the Atlantic.
