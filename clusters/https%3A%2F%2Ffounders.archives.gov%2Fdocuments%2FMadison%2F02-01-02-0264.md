rtment of State: Washington, 20 May 1801.  
Your letters of 2 &amp; 18 Septr. 6 Octr. 1. 9. 10. 15. 16. 13. 25, 19, &amp; 21 Novr. and 8th. Decr. have been received since the date of Mr. Lincoln’s letter by the Grand Turk, which sailed from New York in March last, with the third cargo of Regalia for Tunis.  
The proofs, which have been given by the Bashaw of Tripoli, of hostile designs against the United States, have, as you will learn from Commodore Dale, determined the President to send into the Mediterranean a squadron of three Frigates and a sloop of war, under the command of that officer. Should war have been declared or hostilities commenced, this force will be immediately employed in the defence and protection of our commerce against the piracies of that regency. It is hoped that the contagion will not have spread either to Tunis or Algiers; but should one or both of them have followed the perfidious example, their corsairs will be equally repelled and punished.  
The policy of exhibiting a naval force on the coast of Barbary has long been urged by yourself and the other Consuls. The present moment is peculiarly favourable for the experiment, not only as it is a provision against an immediate danger, but as we are now at peace and amity with all the rest of the world, and as the force employed would, if at home, be at nearly the same expense, with less advantage to our mariners. The President has therefore every reason to expect the utmost exertions of your prudence and address, in giving the measure an impression most advantageous to the character and interests of the United States. In effecting this object, the means must be left in a great degree to your knowledge of the local and other circumstances, which cannot be understood at this distance. You will of course take due pains to satisfy the Bey, that the United States are desirous of maintaining peace with all nations, who are willing to live in peace, that they have given abundant evidence of their disposition to cultivate the Friendship of the Barbary Regencies and of himself in particular, and that if the flag of the United States should be engaged in war with either of them, it will be a war of defence and necessity, not of choice or provocation. You will also give every friendly explanation and assurance, on this occasion, which may be requisite for the Consuls and Agents of other powers residing at Tunis.  
You are authorized to inform the Bey of Tunis, that a vessel is now preparing to take in the cargo, which will complete the Regalia due to him, and that no time will be lost in getting her on her voyage. The jewells, to the amount of $40,000, have, as you know, been ordered to be prepared in London. On the 28th. Decr. last, Mr. King wrote: “I have concluded to take immediate measures to provide the Jewells enumerated in the list furnished by Mr. Eaton. Some of the articles can be soon prepared and sent: others, including the arms and almost all the jewelry will require a long time to be prepared.” If they are essential to the preservation of peace and the benefits of the Treaty with the Bey, they must be yielded to him. The demand is nevertheless deemed so extortionate, that the President expects from you every practicable exertion to get rid of it, or as much as circumstances will permit you to withhold. The articles, withdrawn from the present, may be preserved, to be applied on some future occasion, which may demand them.  
It will be agreeable both to the humanity of the President and the policy of your situation, to render kind offices to the British and all others within your Consulate; but you cannot be permitted to accept an appointment from any other Government than the United States.  
The Ship purchased by you, being foreign built, is excluded by a construction of our laws from having a mediterranean pass.  
The President has taken into consideration your request of leave of absence, and thinks it might be too injurious to the affairs of the United States, especially during the present critical state of the Mediterranean. You will perhaps be the less anxious your self for such an indulgence, which seems to have been suggested by the collision of sentiments between Mr. OBrien and you, when you learn, that Mr. OBrien is to be replaced, at his own request by another Consul General. The return of the squadron will furnish a safe opportunity for transmitting your accounts to Government.  
I conclude with enjoining on you the most cordial and respectful communications with Commodore Dale, and the ready assistance of him with all such useful information and other good offices as it may be in your power to render; and with offering you my sincere wishes for your success in all your measures for advancing the welfare of our country.

to WiViam Eaton, efq. dated IVuJbington,  
May SOtb, 1801.  
Your letter of the 2d and lsth September.  
6th October, 1, 9, 10, i5, 16, 13, 2.5, 19 and  
Sift November, and 8th December, have been  
received finre the date of Mr, Lincoln’s letter,  
by the Grand Turk, which filled from New.  
York in March laft, with the third cargo of re­  
galia, for Tunis. The proofs which have herv  
given, by the baftiaw of Tripoli, of hoftilede­  
tigns againft the United States, have, as vou  
will learn from Commodore Dale, determined  
the Prefident to fend into the Mediterranean a  
Tquadron of three frigates and a (loop of war,  
under the command of that officer. Should  
war have been declared, or hofti&#x27;itit&#x27;3 com­  
menced, this force will he immediately employ­  
ed in the defence and protevftion of our com­  
merce, againft the piracies of that legcncy. It  
is hoped that the contagion will not have  
fpread either to Tunis or Algiers; ’out fliould  
one or both of them hare followed the perfidi­  
ous example, their cot fairs will be equally re­  
pelled and puniflied.  
The policy of exhibiting a naval force on the  
coaft of Birbary, has long been urged by your­  
felf and the other confute. The prefent mo­  
ment is peculiarly favorable for the experi­  
ment, not only as it is a provifion againft an  
immediate danger, but as we are now at peace  
and amity with all the reft of the world, and as  
the force employed would, if at home, be at  
nearly the fame evpenfe, with lefs advantage  
to our mariners. The Prefident has, therefore,  
every reafon toexpeftthe ntmoft exertions of  
vbiir ptudehce and addrefi, in giving the mea­  
fuican imprtffioh moft advantageous to the  
character and intereftsof the United States. In  
eflcdling this object, the means mull be left, in  
a great degree, to yonr knowledge of the lo­  
cal, and other circumrtnnccs, which cannot be  
umlerftood at this diftance. You will, of  
ronrfe, take due pains to fatisfy the bey, that  
the United States are defirous of maintaining  
peace with all nations, who are willing to live  
in peace ; that they have given abundant evi­  
dence of their difpofitioii to cultivate the  
friendfhip of the B.irbary regencies, and of him­  
fclt in particular; and that if the flag of the U.  
States fhotild be engaged in a war with either  
of them, it will he a war of defence and necef­  
fity, not of choice or provocation You will  
alfo give every friendly explanation and aflb­  
rance on this occafion, which may he rrqui­  
fite for the confute and agent9 of other powers  
refiding at Tunir.  
You are authorifed to inform the bey of Tu­  
nis, that a vrfirl is now preparing to take in the  
cargo, which wi/Jcomplete the regalia due to  
him, and that no time will |je loft in getting her  
on her voyage. The jewels, to the amount of  
40,000 dollars, have, as you know, been or­  
dered to be prepaied in London. On the 28th  
December laft, Mr. King wrote—“ I have con­  
cluded to take immrdiate meafiires to provide  
the jewels enumerated in the lift furnilhed by  
Mr. Eaton. Some of ihe articles can be foon  
prepared and fent : others, including the arm°,  
and almc.ft all thejeweiry, will require a long  
time to he prepared.” If they are eflential to  
the prefervation of peace, and the benefits of  
the treaty with the bey, they mull be yielded to I  
kirn.  
  
It w ul he agreeable, both to the humanity of  
the Prelulent atul the polirv of your fituation,  
to render kind offices to the Britiih, and all o­  
thers within yoi rconfnlate, hut you cannot he  
permitted tp accept an appointment from any  
other government than theU. States.  
HThc fi&#x27;.ip purehafed hy you, being foreign  
built, is excluded, hy a conftrmffion of our  
laws, from having a Mediterranean pafs.  
The Prcfideot has taken into confiderntion  
your rrqueft.of leave of ahllnce, and thinks it  
might he too inhirious tp the affairs of the U­  
nited S&#x27;afcs, efpecially during the prefent cri­  
tical (late of the Mediterranean.  
I conclude with enjoining on you the mod  
cordial and refpcclftd communications with  
commodore Dale, and the ready affiftance of  
him, with all fuch ufeful information, and o­  
tker good offices, as it mav he in your powpr  
to render, and with offering you mv fmcere  
wifhes for yourfuccefsin all your meafures, for  
advancing the welfare of our country.

rcinbcr, and Cth December, have been received  
since the date of Mr. Lincoln’s letter by the Gran:&#x27;  
Turk, which sailed from New-York in March last,  
with the then cargo of regalia, for Tunis. The proofs  
which have been given by the Bashaw of Tripoli, ol

you will learn from commodore&#x27;Dale, determined

clared, or hostilities commenced, this force will be  
immediately employed in the defence and protection  
of our commerce against the piracy of that regency.  
It is hoped that the contagion will not have spread

ot them have iollowed the perfidious example, their

that if the flag of the United States of America should
