verneur] Morris was nominated minister plenipotentiary to the French republic; which nomination I opposed, because I was persuaded from Mr. Morris’s known political character and principles, that his appointment, and especially at a period when the French nation was in a course of revolution, from an arbitrary to a free government, would tend to discountenance the republican cause there and at home, and otherwise weaken, and greatly to our prejudice, the connection subsisting between the two countries.  
Mr Morris was known to be a man of first rate abilities; and his integrity &amp; honor had never been impeached. Besides, Mr Morris was sent whilst the Kingly Governmt was in existance the end of 91 or begg of 92.  
[Page iv]  
. . . Mr. [John] Jay was nominated to Great Britain; which nomination too I opposed, because under all the well known circumstances of the moment, I was of opinion we could not adopt such a measure, consistently either with propriety, or any reasonable prospect of adequate success; . . . moreover, because I was of opinion, in the then state of European affairs, it would be made by the enemies of the two Republics the means of embroiling us with France, the other party to the European war; and because I thought it was unconstitutional to appoint a member of the judiciary into an executive office: and lastly, because I also thought, from a variety of considerations, it would be difficult to find within the limits of the United States, a person who was more likely to improve, to the greatest possible extent, the mischief to which the measure naturally exposed us. This last example took place only a few weeks before my own appointment, which was on the 28th of May, 1794.  
Did the then situation of our affairs admit of any other alternative than Negotiation or War? Was there an abler man, to be found to conduct the former, or one more esteemed?  
  
When I considered these circumstances, I was surprised that this proposal should be made me by the administration, and intimated the same to the Secretary of State [Edmund Randolph]; who replied, that my political principles, which were known to favor the French revolution and to cherish a friendly connection with France, were a strong motive with the President for offering me the mission, since he wished to satisfy the French government what his own sentiments were upon those points.  
And who had better opportunities of knowing what these were, than the confidential officers about his person, for the time being?  
[The Secretary of State said] that I should be placed on a theatre where I might gratify my feelings in those respects, and at the same time render a more useful and acceptable service to my country; for that our affairs with France had fallen into great derangement, and required an immediate and decisive effort to retrieve them.  
Did not this derangement proceed from the injurious conduct of the French, in their violations of the 23d and 24th Art[icle]s of the Treaty with the U.S. and the application of the latter for redress?  
[Pages iv-v]  
My instructions . . . enjoined it on me, to use my utmost endeavours to inspire the French government, with perfect confidence in the solicitude which the president felt for the success of the French revolution, of his preference for France to all other nations as the friend and ally of the United States; of the grateful sense which we still retained for the important services that were rendered us by France in the course of our revolution; and to declare in explicit terms, that although neutrality was the lot we preferred, yet in case we embarked in the war it would be on her side and against her enemies, be they who they might.  
And is there to be found in any letter from the Governmt to him, a single sentiment repugnant thereto? On the contrary, are not the same exhortations repeated over &amp; over again? But could it be inferred from hence that in order to please Fr. we were to relinquish our rights, &amp; sacrifice our Com[merc]e?  
[Page v]  
The mission of Mr. Jay to London was particularly noticed [in Monroe’s instructions]; because it was, I presume, deemed more likely to produce or foster such doubts. Upon this point my instructions were as follows: “It is not improbable you will be obliged to encounter on  
  
this head suspicions of various kinds. But you may declare the motives of that mission to be, to obtain immediate compens

. . . nothing could be more delightful to me than . . . to contribute to reclaim to the bonds of a close amity, two countries whose friendship was contracted in the war of our revolution, and which ought to be eternal; but who were now unhappily diverging from each other, and in danger of being thrown wholly apart; and, as I presumed, equally against the interest and inclination of both.  
Why? Because one Nation was seeking redress for violations &amp; injuries committed by the other.  
[Page vii]  
Upon my arrival in Paris, which was on the 2d of August 1794, I found that the work of alienation and disunion had been carried further than I had before even suspected.  
For the reasons abovementioned. If we had submitted to them without remonstrating we shd still have been their dear frds &amp; allies.  
I presented my credentials to the commissary of foreign affairs, soon after my arrival; but more than a week had elapsed, and I had obtained no answer, when or whether I should be received. A delay beyond a few days surprised me, because I could discern no adequate or rational motive for it.  
How does this accord with his communications to the Secretary of State. See letters of the 11th &amp; 25th Augt ps. 7 &amp; 35. Has he not assigned very satisfactory reasons for the delay? Does the answer of the President of the Convention indicate any coolness or discontent on the part of the French Government? What then was it he had to contend against at his out set?  
It was intimated to me that the committee, or several at least of its members, had imbibed an opinion that Mr. Jay was sent to England with views unfriendly to France, and that my mission to France was  
  
adopted for the purpose of covering and supporting his to England; that the one was a measure of substantial import, contemplating on our part a close union with England; and that the other was an act of policy, intended to amuse and deceive.

 to the convention . . . I thought I perceived distinctly that not only the temper which had been shewn by the committee, but the general derangement of our affairs with France, proceeded in a great measure, if not altogether, from the same cause, a suspicion that we were unfriendly to them.  
Or more properly perceiving that we were determined not to be drawn into the vortex if it were possible to avoid it.  
The first object to which I turned my attention was the deranged state of our commerce, and the first application I made to the committee of public safety was for a restoration of the ancient and legitimate order of things, with reparation to our citizens for the injuries they had sustained by a departure from it. My first note to the committee of public safety on this subject, bears date on the 3d of September, 1794; in which I discussed and combated copiously, and as ably as I could, the conduct of France in thus harassing our commerce, against the stipulations of certain articles in our treaty with her; and urged earnestly the immediate repeal of the decrees which authorized that proceeding.  
But finally told it (contrary to express Instructions) that if it was not convenient to comply with those Arti[cle]s, the Governmt &amp; People of the U: States wd give them up with pleasure altho’ it was the pivot on wch our claim was fixed—See letter 3d Sep. pa. 35.  
[Page x]  
But yet I was unwilling to suffer the impression which the manner of my reception by the convention had made upon the community at large, to pass off, without an effort to improve it to advantage; and was persuaded from what I witnessed of the general temper of the public councils, that the way to turn that impression to the best account, was to make a liberal and generous appeal, on our part, to like motives on theirs. Upon this principle, therefore, and upon due consideration of the above circumstances, the last clause in that note was drawn. By this  
  
however I do not wish to be understood as having been guided by political motives only in expressing the sentiments contained in that clause; on the contrary I admit they were strictly my own; affirming at the same time that they would never have been thus expressed, had I not been satisfied, they were such, as it was honourable for the United States to express, and were likely also to promote their interest.

 the committee itself I could obtain no answer, and to my informal applications to some of its members, I found that the difficulty of allowing our vessels to protect the property of English subjects, whilst they gave none to that of French citizens, against the English cruisers, with that of distinguishing in our favor from the case of Denmark and Sweden, in which we were now involved, were objections of great weight with the committee.  
Such was our Treaty. If Denmark &amp; Sweden were not entitled to the same, by Treaty, wherein lay the difficulty of discrimination? and what are the advantages of Treaties if they are to be observed no longer than they are convenient?  
I thought I perceived, still remaining in the councils of that body, a strong portion of that suspicion of our views, in regard to our mission to England, so impressive upon my arrival; but which I had hoped was eradicated; and the more earnestly I pressed an accommodation with my demands the more obviously did this

Nor did France invite us to the war, or manifest a wish that we should engage in it; whilst she was disposed to assist us in securing our claims upon those powers, against whom we complained of injuries. In short, such was our situation with the French Republic . . . that there was but one point upon which we had cause to feel or express any solicitude, which was that it might not vary.

In promising to communicate to the committee the contents of this treaty as soon as I knew them, I did so in the expectation of fulfilling my promise, when I received a copy of the treaty from the department of state, and not before; for I expected no further information upon that subject from Mr. Jay.  
This declaration can not be reconciled with the various attempts which he made to obtain it, both from Mr Jay and Mr [Thomas] Pinckney; for the information of the French Government, before it was known to his own.  
[Page xx]  
. . . sometime in March I received another letter from him [John Jay] of the 19th of February, by Colonel [John] Trumbull; in which he informed me, he had authorized that gentleman, to communicate to me the contents of that treaty, in perfect confidence, to be imparted to no other person. This last letter was still more extraordinary than any which preceded it: For as he had refused to send me a copy of the treaty, according to my request, by Mr. [John] Purviance, and omitted, not to say refused (though indeed I understood his omission in the light of a refusal) otherwise to inform me of its contents, by that very safe opportunity, I did not see how the correspondence could be continued on that subject, on his part.

These considerations will, I presume, likewise sufficiently explain why I would make no representation to the French government of the contents of that treaty, for which I became personally responsible,

 was.  
[Page xxii]  
Such was my conduct upon the above occasion, and such the motives of it.  
And extraordinary indeed it was!  
[Page xxiii]  
In this he notices my address to the convention; as also my letter to the committee of public safety of the third of September following; both of which acts he censures in the most unreserved and harsh manner. In the first he charges me with having expressed a solicitude for the welfare of the French Republic, in a stile too warm and affectionate; much more so than my instructions warranted; which too he deemed the more reprehensible, from the consideration, that it was presented to the convention in public and before the world, and not to a committee in a private chamber, since thereby, he adds, we were likely to give offence to other countries, particularly England, with whom we were in treaty; and since, also, the dictates of sincerity do not require that we should publish to the world all our feelings in favor of France.  
And would it not have been more consistent with our declaration of Neutra[lit]y?  
For the future, he [Randolph] instructs me, to cultivate the French Republic with zeal, but without any unnecessary eclat, and by my letter to the committee, demanding an indemnity for spoliations, and a repeal of the decrees suspending the execution of certain articles of our treaty of commerce with France, he objects that I had yielded an interest it was my duty to secure.  
No reasoning can justify the measure—Nor no circumstances Warrant his relinquishmt of our rights.  
To this letter I replied immediately, in one of the 12th of February, in which I answered, explicitly, his several charges, and, I presume, proved they were unfounded in every instance. Upon this occasion I thought proper in reply to his first charge, to lay open more fully than I had before done, some truths, at which, indeed, I had before only glanced; particularly the light in which our administration was viewed by the committee upon my arrival. . . .

 beforehand with what eclat the reception was to be, to make a parade of sentiments, however strong they might be felt, &amp; however pleasing to one Nation, which might create unpleasant feelings in other Nations with whom we were also in Peace, &amp; wished to remain so.  
[Page xxvii]  
. . . I was asked . . . whether we wished to possess the Floridas, since it was intimated it would be easy for France to obtain them; but which she would not do otherwise than with a view to cede them to the United States. . . . Well satisfied I am, that France declined taking them  
  
[the Floridas] in her treaty with Spain, which soon followed, from a fear it might weaken her connection with the United States.  
Guess work this—&amp; not at all probable from that motive.  
Had that treaty then never passed, and had we also otherwise preserved the ground upon which we stood with that nation, in the commencement of its revolution, what might we not have expected from its friendship?  
Nothing, if she did not perceive some advantage to herself in granting it.  
About the middle of May I received a letter from Mr. [William] Short at Madrid, written by the desire of the duke of Alcudia, chief minister of Spain, to request that I would . . . endeavour to open a new and more active negociation between that power and France, he having previously assured Mr. Short, that the claims of the United States should be adjusted to their satisfaction. The prospect therefore of success in that important concern was now as fair as it could be.  
This wd all have been ascribed to France if that Government had had the least Agency in the Negociation.  
[Pages xxvii-xxviii]  
[In May 1795] Mr. Pinckney, who was commissioned to negociate and adjust our interfering claims with Spain, arrived in Paris on his way to Madrid. I informed him of what had passed between the committee of public safety and myself upon that subject; assuring him . . . if he would explain the object of his mission to the committee and ask its friendly co operation, satisfying it at the same time, that the interests of France were not injured by our treaty with England, that such aid would be granted. Mr. Pinckney was aware of the benefit which would be derived from such aid; but yet did not consider himself at liberty to obtain it, by shewing a copy of Mr. Jay’s treaty, which I intimated might be necessary completely to remove the doubts that were entertained in that respect, and therefore deemed it most suitable to say nothing to the committee upon the subject of his mission

That the administration had injured me, was a point upon which I had no doubt; that it had likewise compromised its own credit, and with it that of the United States, was also a truth equally obvious to my mind.  
But not so in either case to an impartial &amp; discriminating mind.  
Upon mature reflection, therefore, it appeared that I had but one alternative, which was to remain where I was, and proceed in the functions of my office, notwithstanding the embarrassments to which I might be personally subjected, or to retire, and in retiring, to do it tranquilly, without explaining my motives for it; or by explaining them, denounce the administration to the public. . . . Besides, it seemed probable that my retreat at that moment, in either mode, might have some influence in inducing the French government to adopt a system of policy toward us, which it was equally my duty and my wish to prevent.

Mr Donaldson was, by Colo. Humphreys Instructed to proceed to Alicante, and act according to Circumstances. A favourable moment occured—and he was advised by persons well acquainted with the state of matters at Algiers, and the then policy of the Dey to embrace it—He did so—and happily succeeded—But not in the way most agreeable to Mr Monroe—as it was effected without the Agency of the F[renc]h.

h the contents of that Treaty was unknown &amp; assurances were given that their rights were saved.  
And by me it was never introduced, for as I had no new communication to make to the committee upon it, whereby to remove the suspicions that were entertained of its contents, and any allusion to it in that state could of course only serve to revive unpleasant sensations to our disadvantage, I thought it most eligible to keep it out of view.  
That is one of the material charges against him—for altho’ he had himself given information of the suspicions, doubts, &amp; discont[en]ts as abovementioned, and was possessed of the sentimts of his Government relative thereto with the intention to remove them, he keeps these out of view until he is informed that the Directory have made up their mind upon the subject.  
Early in June 1795 accounts were received in Paris that the British government had revived its order for the seizure of provision vessels destined for France. . . . It was soon obvious that this aggression of Great Britain upon the rights of neutral nations, being made with the intent to increase the distress of famine which was then raging at Paris, and thereby promote the disorders which were in part attributable to that cause, excited a ferment in the French councils which was not pointed against Great Britain alone.

About the middle of August 1795, American gazettes were received at Paris containing copies of the English treaty, whereby its contents were made known to the committee of public safety without my aid.

. . . I informed the administration explicitly, that if the treaty was rejected, and it was wished to command with effect the fortunes of France in any further negociation with England ... it would not only be necessary for the administration to avail itself of some well known pronounced character in regard to the great question which now agitates the world, to whose care the negociation should be committed, but that in other respects extraordinary circumspection should be used in the prosecution of the negociation itself.  
  
The reader will be at no loss to discover who is here pointed at, nor for what purpose it is done.  
The letter of June 1st contained a justification of the conduct of the administration in forming a commercial treaty with Great Britain at that period; and likewise a vindication of the administration against the charge of a want of candor (which seemed to be apprehended) in the explanations that were given by it of the motives of that mission; in which the idea of a commercial power was always withheld.  
This never would, or cd have been apprehended had it not been seen that the enemies of the government were determined to have it so consid[ere]d.  
How withheld? Is it usual, or was it necessary to publish to the world all the points on which the negociation was to turn? His own conduct evinces how indiscreet it would have been to have entrusted him with them.  
The letter of July 2d contained advice, that the treaty was not ratified, and that the president was undecided upon the point of ratification.  
Upon no other ground than that of the subsequent conduct of G.B. relative to the Provision order, so called.  
[Page xxxviii]  
It was inferred from these letters, that, when that of June 1st was written, the executive had resolved to ratify the treaty in case the senate approved it, and that the hesitation which afterwards took place proceeded more from the shock which the general disapprobation of the treaty by the people gave the administration, than from any disinclination on its own part to the ratification.  
A mistake in toto—the hesitation as mentioned on the other side proceeded from the Provision order for it was obvious to the least discerning that an opposition by the French Party had been resolved on at all events—and had actually commenced before a single Art[icle] in the Treaty was known: and the blaze which he describes broke out before it was possible to consider it, or a hundredth part of its opposers had ever read it!  
It was likewise inferred that that letter was written with a view to lay the foundation for such an event, in the expectation the ratification would probably embroil us with France.  
It was well conceived that there was nothing in the Treaty which ought to have embroiled this Country with France.  
  
In one particular the contents of this letter affected me personally, by affirming that my instructions had not warranted the construction I had given them, in explaining as I had done the motives of Mr. Jay’s mission to London

[Page xliii]  
My wish was to conciliate the French government towards the treaty which was now ratified, and most anxiously had I looked to the administration for the means of doing it.  
What means is it he wanted? Did he expect to be authorised to declare that the Government was in an error in having made a Treaty without first obtaining the consent of France—&amp; to ask pardon for not having submitted Mr Jays instructions &amp; the terms of it to the rulers of that Country before it was ratified?  
Acts of candor when performed, if acknowledged by the party to whom they are said to be rendered, ought not to be boasted of by those who perform them.  
Why not, if the fact was admitted allow the American government to adopt some of the all perfect maxims of the French—It will not be denied that to boast of what they do, and even of what they do not do is one of them.  
Indeed it professes to notice, and in fact notices only one article, the 18th, and in so doing, admits in effect all the objections that were urged against it: For it agrees that we had thereby not only yielded the modern rule of contraband, with respect to general kinds of merchandize, which by special treaties were made articles of free trade; but that we had also made an arrangement with England, whereby she was permitted to seize our provision vessels destined to France, whenever a crisis arrived which made it eligible for her so to do, upon the condition of paying us for the provisions thus seized a reasonable mercantile profit, including freight and the expences incident to detention.

What was the point in controversy between the two countries . . . ? Was it not simply whether the pretensions of England, who claimed a right to seize provisions, as contraband, as pleasure, with a view to starve France, should be allowed? ... Or would the administration, in a demand of payment for those seizures, which took place after the treaty was concluded, distinguish the cases, and confine that demand to such vessels as were taken in their route to a blockaded port, saying, for these only will we be paid, but for the others, comprehending perhaps 99 out of 100, we will not—and thus revive the controversy which it was said was thus amicably closed?

To reconcile France to that treaty, I expected to have been authorised to explain to her government how long the commercial part was to remain in force; to state to it formally, that we were ready to enter into a new commercial treaty with her, and upon what principles, to be commenced either in Paris or Philadelphia: In which expectation, and with a view to the event of a ratification, I had told the administration, when I advised it of the ill-effect the treaty, whose contents were then known, had produced, that I should await its orders without any, the slightest, compromitment either of it or myself.

]  
But it was my duty to answer this letter, which I did without a comment; for it was improper for me to censure and useless to advise.  
When a rational answer and good reasons cannot be given, it is not unusual to be silent.  
I shewed, it is true, no mark of undue condescension to that government.  
Few will be of this opinion, who reads this Book.  
[Page xlvii]  
Soon after the new government [Directory] was organized I received a letter from the minister of foreign affairs, complaining of the misconduct of Mr. [John] Parish, American consul at Hamburgh, in granting passports to English subjects as American citizens . . . some considerable time before this I had earnestly recommended this measure to our administration, urging many considerations, suggested as well by some particulars of his own conduct, as by the circumstance of his being a British subject. . . . Those considerations appeared to me to be so strong and pressing, that I concluded, as soon as they were brought to the view of the administration, he [John Parish] would be removed, and of course that the measure was already taken: In which expectation I answered the minister politely, intimating that I should  
  
communicate to our government the request of his in that respect, not doubting that it would be readily complied with.  
Upon the first intimation of misconduct in Mr Parish an enquiry into it was instituted: but Mr Monroe as it was the wish of the French Govt would have had him discharged without a hearing—but when another Consul of the U. States was as highly charged with acts equally repugnant to Neutrality, (in favour of Fr[ance]) he could find nothing amiss in his conduct.  
And the subsequent management of the [Parish] affair upon the application of the French government shewed that the incident became rather a cause of irritation, than of conciliation with that government; notwithstanding the evident impolicy of such a procedure at the time, on account of the crisis to which we were brought: For although the administration (not being able to resist the objections to his continuance) did remove him, yet it was done in a manner so as to shew the French government, it was not done in compliance with its request.  
A candid explanation of a motive is here deemed a cause for irritation, notwithstanding the request is complied with.  
[Page xlviii]  
Much too was said in that address of the advantage of our accommodation with Britain, as likewise of the favourable disposition of that power towards us, without the slightest attention being shewn to the French Republic. . . .  
To state facts for the information of Congress, and not to write eulogiums on the French Nation, or conduct was the object of the then President. If Mr Monroe should ever fill the Chair of Government he may (and it is presumed he would be well enough disposed) let the French Minister frame his Speeches.  
. . . unless indeed it was referred to in the picture of distress above noticed, as was inferred by the French government, as I understood from good authority, at the time.  
If the Cap did not fit, why put it on?  
In the course of the year 1795, the French government had repealed, as already shewn, all the decrees which were passed during the mission of Mr. Morris, under which our trade had beenharrassed. . . .  
But has our suffering Commerce reed any Compensation? and why was not this urged with firmness, agreeable to his Instructns?  
  
... yet none of those acts or of the disposition which produced them were even glanced at in the president’s address to congress, although it was to be inferred, such notice would have produced a good effect, and although it was then as just as it was politic to notice them.  
What! declare to the world in a public speech that we were going to Treat with this and that Nation, and that France was to assist us! Insanity in the extreme!  
This conduct in the administration was the more extraordinary, from the consideration that those decrees, by whose authority our trade was harrassed, with the harrassment itself, had been announced in former communications to the congress, when the British depredations were announced.  
Could this repeal be announced before it was known [?]  
Under such circumstances it was impossible for me to succeed in conciliating the French government towards the British treaty, since my efforts were not only not seconded in that respect, by our administration, but absolutely counteracted by it.  
In what respect counteracted?  
Nevertheless I continued to pursue the same line of conduct that I had done before, being resolved not to relax in my efforts, however unsuccessful I might be.  
That is not doubted, but for what purpose were they exerted?  
[Page xlix]  
The sequel of my mission exhibits an interesting but painful spectacle, the distinguishing characteristics whereof are; the avowed decision of the French government to take some measure towards us in consequence of our treaty with England, as illustrated by many examples; with my efforts to prevent any such measure taken effect; and the attack made on me by our administration, upon pretexts equally unjust, frivolous and absurd.  
An impartial public will be enabled, from his own shewing, to decide more correctly than he has done, how far these sentiments are just.  
On the 15th of February 1796, I called on the minister of foreign affairs to state to him the distress of many of our citizens, merchants at Paris, on account of their claims upon the French government, with a view to engage his aid for their relief; but was immediately diverted  
  
from that object by information which he gave me, that the directory had at length made up its mind how to act in regard to our treaty with England; which it considered as having annulled our treaty of alliance with France, from the period of its ratification; and had appointed or intended to appoint an Envoy extraordinary, to repair to Philadelphia to remonstrate against it; adding that he was ordered to send me an official note upon the subject, which he should accordingly do.  
It not suiting the French Government to pay, and knowing the trim of our Minister, the British Treaty, or something else was always played off to silence his applicatns.  
I attended him again on the day following, and remonstrated most earnestly against the measure ... offering to enter with him, whenever he thought fit, into a discussion of his objections to our treaty ... since by being possessed of our view of the subject, they would be better able to decide whether the complaint was well or ill founded, and of course how far it merited to be considered in that light.  
Had he applied the means in time with which he was furnished matters might not have come to this.  
Upon this occasion, as upon the preceding one, the minister declined stating any specific objections to the treaty, or any other act of our government, and therefore I could make no specific defence.  
Declined for the best reason in the world because he had none that would bear the test of examination.  
[Page l]  
. . . a summary of those complaints was presented me by the minister of foreign affairs. . . .  
and is there a candid &amp; well informed man to be met with, who will carefully compare this summary of complts with our Treaties, with Fr. and G. Britn, &amp; these again with the Laws of Nations, and not pronounce them the most futile that can be conceived to come from a Nation who would be thought to act from principles of Independence and justice?  
[Page li]  
From the period of my audience by the directory, and more especially after my communication with the minister of foreign affairs was handed in, I had frequent conferences with several of the members of the directory, in which I labored to promote the same object, and at one time, as I thought, with complete success; being informed by  
  
a member, upon one of those occasions, that the directory had done nothing towards us in regard to its complaints, and he presumed would not.

In her foreign relations nothing is to be seen but the waste and pillage of her commerce, sometimes by several powers, always by some one power; and little less than anarchy at home; for the seeds of discontent, jealousy and disunion have been scattered throughout these States, in the course of few years past, with a wasteful hand. By what means then was this state of things produced, and why was it produced?  
That is a bold assertion! and no compliment to the other departmts of the Governt.  
[Page liv]  
It is well known, that the executive administration has heretofore guided all our measures; pursuing, in many instances, a course of policy equally contrary to the public feeling, and the public judgment.  
The instances ought to have been enumerated.  
But by this attack on me, a new topic has been raised for discussion, which has drawn the public attention from the conduct of the administration itself; for in consequence the only question now before the public seems to be, whether I have merited the censure thus pronounced upon me, by the administration, or have been dealt hardly by. But this was a mere political manœuvre, intended doubtless to produce that effect.  
Self importance appears here.  
Whether I have performed my duty to my country, as I ought to have done, in the various, contradictory, and embarrassing situations, in which I was placed by the administration, is a point upon which my

Neither the Constitution—the Laws—nor Usage, render it necessary for the Executive to assign his reasons.

It will however be seen by a perusal of my discussion with the minister of foreign affairs, that I omitted nothing which either of those papers contained, which could be turned to any account.  
If it was not known, on what ground was the Adm[inistratio]n to have formed a judgment?  
The first of these facts [that Randolph’s letter of 14 July when received was “put into the hands of the committee of public safety”], it is true, was not then known to the secretary; for as the object, at that time contemplated by the committee, was not pursued, on account I presume of the change of government which took place immediately afterwards in France, and might possibly never be revived, I declined mentioning it to our administration, from motives of delicacy to both governments; wishing, if to be avoided, that no such evidence of the discontent of France, should appear in my correspondence.

re as Independent as France.  
Whether I contributed in any degree to divert the French government from opposing the ratification of that treaty, or taking its measures after the treaty was ratified, I will not pretend to say.  
It is believed the truth here wd not bear to be told—or else the boast wd not be wanting.  
[Page lx]  
Such were the facts and documents in possession of the administration, when it pronounced a censure on my conduct. Can any one then believe, that the motive assigned for it was the true one? And if it was not, what was the true one?  
To determine this latter point some attention is due to the conduct of the administration through every stage of this European controversy; for the whole of its conduct forms a system, which ought to be taken together, to judge correctly of its motives in any particular case.  
Is this to be decided by assertion—or official documts? If the latter, why call this Book a “view of the conduct of the Executive of the U. States” when it relates only to the correspondence with him? if to the former is it to be judged of by his ignorant, partial, &amp; party representations?  
The first is, the appointment of a person as minister plenipotentiary to France, in the commencement of the French revolution, who was known to be an enemy to that revolution, and a partizan of royalty; whereby the name and weight of America (no inconsiderable thing at that time in that respect) was thrown into the scale of kings, against that of the people and of liberty.  
Was not Fr: (as has been observed before) at the time, &amp; long after Mr Morris’s appointment⟨,⟩ a Monarchy? Whatever may have been his political Sentiments, he pursued steadily the honor &amp; Interest of his Ctry with zeal and ability, &amp; with respectful firmness asserted its rights. Had Mr Monroe done the same⟨,⟩, we should not have been in the situation we now are.

.  
Fourth, my appointment to the French republic with the circumstances attending it.  
And an unfortunate one it was.  
[Pages lx-lxi]  
. . . It being known that, with other members of the senate, I had opposed in many instances the measures of the administration, particularly in that of the mission of Mr. Morris to France, and of Mr. Jay to London; from the apprehension those missions would produce, in our foreign relations, precisely the ill effect they did produce.  
Unpardonable, to appt these men to Office, altho’ of acknowledged first rate abilities—when they were of different political Sentiments from Mr Monroe—whose judgmt one wd presume must be infallible.  
[Page lxi]  
Fifth, the instructions that were given me to explain to the French government the motives of Mr. Jay’s mission to London, not as an act of condescension on our part, at the demand of the French government, but of policy, to produce tranquillity, and give satisfaction, whilst the negotiation was depending; by which instructions, if the existence of a power to form a commercial treaty was not positively denied, yet it was withheld, and the contrary evidently implied.  
None but a person incompetent to judge, or blinded by party views, cd have misconstrued as he did. But had Fr: a right to be made acq[uainte]d with the Private Inst[ructio]ns of our Ministers?  
Sixth, the strong documents that were put in my possession at that period, by the administration, of its attachment to France and the French revolution; so different from any thing before expressed.  
From wch he has exhibited nothing but unfounded assertions to prove a departure—but the contrary from his references.  
Seventh, the resentment shewn by the administration on account of the publication of those documents; it having been intended they should produce their effect, at the same time, and yet be kept secret.  
  
Because it was as unnecessary as it was impolitic, to make a parade of them.  
Eighth, the approbation bestowed on me by the administration when I made vehement pressures on the French government for a repeal of its decrees, under which our commerce was harrassed, exhibiting a picture of its spoliations, &amp;c. and the profound silence and inattention of the administration when those decrees were repealed, and a disposition shewn by that government to assist us in other cases.  
No vehement expressions were ever used—but supposing it; is it singular to commend a person for doing his duty? Did the complying with a demand of justice require it when our rights had been outrageously violated by a departure from it? The offer of aid to promote our views with Spain and Algiers was friendly, &amp; if any benefit had been derived from it thanks wd have followed.  
Ninth, the power given to Mr. Jay to form a commercial treaty with England, in the midst of a war, by a special mission, at a time when no such advance was made to treat on that subject with France, and her advances at best coolly received.  
The 1st we had a right to do—and the 2d is denied—for advan[ce]s had been made repeatedly.  
Tenth, The witholding from me the contents of that treaty until after the meeting of the senate; notwithstanding the embarrassment to which I was, in the interim, personally exposed, in consequence of the explanations I had before given to the French government, by order of the administration, of the motives of the mission which produced it; which deportment proves clearly that the administration did not deal fairly with me from the commencements.  
None but a party man, lost to all sense of propriety would have asked such a thing—and, no other wd have brot himself into such a predicamt.  
[Page lxi-lxii]  
Eleventh, the submission of the treaty to Mr. Adet after the advice of the senate, before the ratification of the president; at a time when, as it appears by satisfactory documents, it was resolved to ratify it; which submission therefore was probably not made to obtain the aid of Mr. Adet’s counsel, in which light it would have been improper, especially as it had been withheld from his government; but to repel an objection to the candor of the administration, in its conduct in preceding stages.  
  
And what motive cd be more candid or laudable? or be a stronger argument of the Executive belief of its fairness towds Fr.? To ask Mr Adets advice wd have been strange indeed.  
[Page lxii]  
Twelfth, the character of the treaty itself, by which (according to the administration) we have departed from the modern rule of contraband, with respect to many articles made free by modern treaties.  
The treaty in this respect leaves things precisely upon the footing they were before, with an explanation favourable to the U. States, and not injurious to France.  
Thirteenth, the conduct of the administration after the ratification of the treaty, being in all cases irritable towards France.  
In what Instances irritable? Upon a just interpretation it co[ul]d not offend Fr:—But it was known at the same time, that there were the most unjustifiable means used to make it have this effect.  
Fourteenth, I should not notice my recall, being in itself a circumstance too trivial to merit attention, if it were not for the state in which our affairs were in my hands, when my recall was decided; being at a period when it appeared I had succeeded in quieting the French government for the time, and was likely to do it effectually.  
For this there is no better proof than his own opinion whilst there is abundant evidence of his being a mere tool in the hands of the French government; cajoled &amp; led away always by unmeaning assuran[ce]s of Friends.  
To be left there to that precise time, and then withdrawn and censured, seems to authorise a presumption, that I was left there in the first instance in the expectation I would not defend that treaty, and in consequence whereof a rupture would ensue, and recalled afterwards, when it was known I had done my duty, and was likely to prevent a rupture.  
The contrary of all this appears from his own work, I mean the official part of it.  
[Page lxiii]  
Whether the nature of this crisis contributed in any degree to influence our measures, by repelling us from France and attracting us towards England, is submitted for others to determine.  
  
As he has such a happy knack at determining, he ought not to have let this opportunity escape him.  
Be this however as it may, it is nevertheless obvious, that the policy itself, was, at best, shortsighted and bad.  
Posterity will judge of this. Mr Monroes opinion is not the standard by wch it will be judged.  
To stand well with France through the whole of this European war, was the true interest of America; since great advantage was to be derived from it in many views, and no injury in any.  
But to stand well with Fr. was, in other words, to quit neutral gr[oun]d and disregard every other consideration—relying wholly on that nation, &amp; this was what Monroe was aiming at.  
What would have been the condition of these States had France been conquered, and the coalesced powers triumphed, it is easy to perceive.  
In turn, what will be the consequence of Fr. overturnin

rcourse with her enemies. By it our ships gave protection to the goods of her enemies . . . strict contraband of war only excepted. The beneficial effects too of this stipulation, which was respected by France at the time that treaty passed, was most sensibly felt upon our navigation and commerce; for in consequence of it, we were then become the principal carriers of the enemies of France.  
Was this observed by France any longer than it suited her convenience? Has she not herself declared the contrary in explicit language?  
  
It was highly for the interest of America to improve our footing in that commerce, and easy was it to have done so, had due attention been paid to the necessary means of improving it.  
These, it is presumed, were what he had suggested—viz: measures wch must inevitably have led to war with G: Britn.  
Nor was it difficult to stand well with France through the whole of this crisis, and profit by her fortunes, without the smallest possible loss or even hazard. The demonstration of this position is complete; for we know that although our ground was once lost by the administration, in the course of the present war, it was nevertheless afterwards recovered; although it is much easier to preserve a friendship, whilst at the height, than to recover it after it is gone.  
Here is a pretty smart compliment paid himself, at the expence of the Administration; but the truth of the case is, that while France cajoled him by unmeaning compliments &amp; promises, which cost them nothing, he conceived his Influence to be such as to commd any thing—when, on the other hand, urged by the Orders he recd, to press for the restitution of our Captured property, they alarmed him with their discontents &amp; his efforts stood suspended—these discontts were charged to the Adm.

We might have stood well with France, avoiding all the losses we have sustained from her; enjoying the benefit of the principles of free trade, and even appeared as an advocate for those principles, and without going to any extremity.  
Not by pursuing the modes he suggested.  
And instead of a situation so advantageous, so honorable, so satisfactory to our country, what is that into which our government has conducted us.

place when Mr. Morris was nominated miniſter pleni-  
potentiary to the French republic; which nomination I  
oppoſed, becauſe J was perſuaded, from Mr. Morris&#x27;s  
known political character and principles, that his appoint-  
ment, and eſpecially at a period when the French  
nation was in a courſe of revolutien, from an arbitrary  
to a free government, would tend to diſcountenance the  
republican cauſe there and at home, and otherwiſe  
weaken, and greatly to our prejudice, the connexion  
ſubſiſting between the two countries. The ſecond took  
place when Mr. Jay was nominated to Great Britain;  
which nomination too I oppoſed, becauſe, under all the  
well-known circumſtances of the moment, I was of opi-  
nion. we could not adopt ſuch a meaſure, conſiſtently  
either with propriety, or any reaſonable proſpect of ade-  
quate ſuccels ; ſince being a meaſure without zone, and  
one which ſecured to that power time, which of all things  
it, wiſhed to ſecure, it ſeemed better calculated to anſwer  
  
*  
  
  
nion, in the then ſtate of European affairs, it would be  
made by the enemies of the two republics the means of  
embroiling us with France, the other party to the Euro-  
pean war; and becauſe I thought it was unconſtitutional  
to appoint a member of the judiciary into. an executive  
office: and laſtly, becauſe J alſo thought, from a variety  
of conſiderations, it would be difficult to find within the  
limits of the United States, a perſon who was more  
likely to improve, to the greateſt poſſible extent, the  
miſchief to which the meaſure naturally expoſed us.  
This laſt example took place only a few. weeks before  
my own appointment, which was on the 28th of May  
1794. 1 1 &quot;WL  
| [When I confidered theſe circumſtances, I was ſur-  
« priſed that this propoſal ſhould be made me by the  
adminiſtration, and intimated the ſame to the ſecretary  
of ſtate, who replied, that my political principles,  
which were known to favour the French revolution, and  
to, cheriſh a friendly connexion with France, were a  
ſtrong motive with the preſident for offering me the  
miſſion, ſince he wiſhed to ſatisfy the French govern-  
  
*  
  
ment what his own ſentiments were upon thoſe points.  
He added, that, in his opinion, the preſident was as  
ſincere a friend to the French revolution, and our al-  
liance with France, as I could be, and of. courſe that.  
nothing would be required of me incooſiſtent with my  
own principles; on the contrary, that I ſhould be placed  
on a theatre where I might gratify my feelings in thoſe  
reſpects, and at the ſame time render a moſt uſeful and  
acceptable ſervice to my country; for that our affairs  
with France had fallen into great derangement, and  
required an immediate and decifive effort to retrieye  
them. Thus adviſed, I ſubmitted the propoſition to  
my. friends, who were of opinion I ought to accept ir  
and whereupon I did accept it.  
  
My inſtructions were drawn in ſtrict conformity with  
theſe 1 as will appear by a peruſal of them,  
They enjoined it on me, to uſe my utmoſt endeavours  
to inſpire the French government with perfect confir  
dence in the ſolicitude which the preſident felt for the  
ſucceſs of the French revolution; of his preference for France  
10 all other nations as the friend and ally of the United States;  
of the grateful ſenſe which we ſtill retained for the important  
ſervices that were rendered us by France in the cour ah of 7  
revolution; and to declare in explicit terms that although  
neutrality was the lot we preferred, yet in caſ; e WE, .  
. barked in the war, it would be on her ſide and agai at box  
enemies, be they who they might. Several Fs nk. 90 5  
had occurred in the courſe of our affairs, of a nature to  
create in France doubts of a contrary diſpoſition in our |  
councils, were expreſſiy adverted to, for the purpoſe of  
enabling me to diſſipate thoſe doubts, by ſuch expla-  
nations as might be moſt ſucceſsful. The miſſion of  
Mr. Jay to London was particularly noticed; becauſe  
it was, I preſume, deemed moſt likely to produce or  
foſter ſuch doubts. Upon this point, my inſtructions  
were as follows: * It is not improbable you will, be  
obliged to encounter on this head, ſuſpicions of 1 5  
kinds. But you may declare the motives of that thys epilzon  
to be, to obtain immediate e for, our £ aa

fair and friendly views of our own, to contribute to re-  
claim to the bonds of a cloſe amity, two countries whole  
_ friendſhip was contracted in the war of our revolution,  
and which ought to be eternal; but who were now un-  
happily diverging from each other, and&#x27; in danger of  
being thrown wholly apart; and, as I preſumed, equally  
againſt the intereſt and inclination of both. Nor could  
any thing be more delightful to me, than to be able, by  
  
( 6 )  
means of: that confidence, to recover: to our citizens a  
full indemnity for the injuries they had already ſuſtained  
by the loſs of it: and theſe were the particular duties it  
was enjoined upon me to perform. I embarked there-  
fore immediately, with a view to commence and purſue .  
  
them with zeal. |  
Upon my arrival in Paris, which was on the ad  
of Auguſt 1794, 1 found that the work of alienation  
and diſonion had been carried further than I had before  
even ſuſpected. The haraſſment of our commerce had  
commenced, and gone to ſoine extent; and a- coolneſs  
  
  
oceedings. In ſhort, it was apparent that things were  
in train for an entire ſeparation of the two countries, as  
may be ſeen by reference to the documents which  
exhibit a correct view of the then ſtate of our affairs 8.  
  
I preſented my credentials to the commiſſary of fo-  
reign affairs, ſoon after my arrival; but more than a week  
had elapſed, and I had obtained no anſwer, wheo- or  
— I ſhould be received. A delay beyond a few  
days ſurpriſed me, becauſe I could diſcern no adequate  
or rational motive for it. The ſtate of things occaſioned  
by the fall of Robeſpierre, which took place juſt before  
my arrival, might protract at for that term, but not  
a longer one. Soon however intimations were given  
me, that it proceeded from a very different cauſe; one  
too which materially affected the honour of our adminiſtra-  
tion as well as my own. It was intimated to me that the  
committee, or ſeveral at leaſt of its members, had im-  
bibed an opinion that Mr. Jay was ſent to England with  
views unfriendly to France, and that my. , miſſion to  
France was adopted for che purpoſe of covering and  
ſupporting his to Englond ; that the one was a meaſure  
of ſubſtantial import, contemplating on our part a cloſe  
union with England; and chat the other was an act of  
policy, intended to amuſe and deceive. It was added,  
  
  
ception; but that the committee, being unwilling to be-  
come —— of that policy, was deviſinghow to defeat

I] was capable, The firſt obje&amp; to which I turned my  
attention was the deranged ſtate of our commerce, and  
  
the firſt application I made to the committee of public  
  
ſafety was for a reſtoration of the ancient and legitimate  
  
order of things, with reparation to our citizens for the  
injuries they had ſuſtained by a departure from it. My  
firſt note to the committee of public ſafety on this ſub-  
ject, bears date on the zd of September 1794; in  
which J diſcuſſed and combated copiouſly, and as ably  
as I could, the conduct of France in thus haraſſing our  
commerce, againſt the ſtipulations of certain articles in our  
treaty with her; and urged earneſtly the immediate repeal  
of the decrees which authorized that proceeding. I had  
cloſed my note with this demand, when further re-  
flection, ſtrengthened by the apparent temper of the  
committee, ſuggeſted a doubt whether I. had not tran-  
ſcended my inſtructions, and might not by ſuch a de-  
mand, under ſuch circumſtances, and upon my own  
reſponſibility, bring on my country the embarraſſment  
of demands on the other part, under another article of  
the treaty. I examined again and again my inſtructions,  
and was finally of opinion they did not contemplate the  
demand. But yet I was unwilling to ſuffer the impreſ-  
ſions which the manner of my reception by the conven-  
tion had made upon the community at large, to paſs off,  
without an effort to improve it to advantage; and was  
  
erſuaded from what I witneſſed of the general temper  
of the public councils, that the way to turn that im-  
preſſion to the beſt account, was to make a liberal and  
  
\
  
30 |  
- generous appeal, on our part, to like motives on theirs. \
Upon this principle, therefore, and-upon due conſi-  
deration of the above circumſtances, the laſt clauſe in  
that note was drawn. By this, however, I do not wiſh  
to be underſtood as having been guided by pohtical mo-  
tives only in exprefling the fentiments contained in that  
clauſe; on the contrary, I admit they were ſtrictly my  
own; affirming, at the ſame time, that they would never  
have been thus expreſſed, had I not been ſatisfied they  
were ſuch, as it was honourable for the United States to  
expreſs, and were likely alſo to promote their intereſt.

ject was as follows. After ſpeaking of the Bourdeau

between Mr. Jay and myſelf was at an end, and of courſe,  
that I ſhould, hear nothing further from him upon the  
ſubject of his treaty. But here again I was diſappointed ;  
for ſome time in March I received another letter from  
him of the 19th of February, by Colonel Trumbull ; in  
which he informed me, he had- authorized that gentle-  
man to communicate to me the contents of that treaty,  
in perfect confidence, to be imparted to no other perſon.  
This laſt letter was ſtill more extraordinary than any.  
which preceded it: for-as he had refuſed to ſend me a  
copy of the treaty, according to my requeſt, by Mr,  
Purviance, and omitted, not to ſay refuſed (though, in-

About the middle of May I received a letter from  
Mr. Short, at Madrid, written by the defire of the duke  
of Alcudia, chief miniſter of Spain, to requeſt that I  
would, as miniſter of the United States, endeavour to

Short, that the claims of the United States ſhould be

ſucceſs in chat important concern, was now as fair as it

Shortly after this, Mr. Pinckney, who was commil-

Pinckney was aware of the benefit which would be de-

About the middle of Auguſt 1795, American ga-  
zettes were received at Paris, containing copies of the  
Engliſh treaty, whereby its contents were made known  
tothe committee of public ſafety without my aid. From  
this period therefore all myſtery upon that ſubje&amp; was

French government to judge for itſelf upon all the

it produced an equivocal one; for there did not appear

The letter of June 1ſt, contained a juſtification of the  
conduct of the adminiſtration, in forming a commercial  
treaty with Great Britain at that period; and likewiſe  
à vindication of the adminiſtration againſt the charge  
of a want of candour (which ſeemed to be apprehended)  
in the explanations that were given by it,&#x27;of the motives  
of that miſſion; in which the idea of a commercial power  
was always withheld. The letter of July ad, contained  
advice, that the treaty was not ratified, and that the  
preſident was undecided upon the point of ratification;  
which uncertainty too, as to the ratification, was in-  
creaſed by thoſe of the 14th and 21ſt. A copy of the

It was inferred from theſe letters, that, when that of  
June 1ſt was written, the executive had reſolved to  
ratify the treaty, in caſe the ſenate approved it, and  
that the heſitation which afterwards took place, pro-  
ceeded. more from the ſhock which the general diſap-  
probation of the treaty by the people gave the admint- |

My wiſh was to conciliate the French government

The tone of the new government was cool and reſerved  
  
  
object was the ſame. I ſhowed, it is true, no mark of  
undue condeſcenſion to that government, but yet I cer-  
tainly omitted no opportunity that occurred to gonciliate  
its good will towards us. Unhappily, however, a very  
different ſpirit now diſplayed itſelf in our adminiſtration,  
whoſe meaſures obviouſly tended to promote a rupture.  
Soon after the new government was organized I re-  
ceived. a letter from the miniſter of foreign affairs, com-  
plaining of the miſconduct of Mr. Pariſh, American con-  
ful at Hamburgh, in granting paſfports to Engliſh ſub-  
je&amp;s as American citizens, and in being the agent of  
Eng land for the equipment of the emigrants ; deſiring  
tae I would communicate his note to our government,  
with a requeſt that Mr. Pariſh be removed. Some con-  
ſiderable time before this I had earneſtly recommended  
this meaſure to our adminiſtration, urging many conſi-  
derations, ſuggeſted as well by ſome particulars of his  
own conduct, as by te circumſtance of his being a  
Britiſh ſubj ct, why it was of importance to our intereſt  
and character as a ſeparate and neutral people, that bis  
commiſhon ſhould be revoked, and committed to an  
American citizen, Thoſe conſiderations appeared to me  
to be ſo ſtrong and preſſing, that ] concluded, as ſoon  
as they were brought to the view of the aiminifizmion,  
he would be removed, and, of courſe, that the meaſure  
was already taken: in ch expetation ] an{wered the  
minifter politely, intimating that 1 ſhould communicate  
to our government the requeſt of his in that reſpect, not  
doubting that it would be readily complied with. I  
ſhould have ated, that I had anticipated the demand  
ſome time hefore, and recommended the meaſure of my  
  
  
French government, that ic might appear to be granted

letters, in ſome of which the French republic was  
ſpoken of in terms by no means reſpectful, and the  
friends of the French revolution in the United States re-  
  
oached with being the friends of war and confuſion.”  
And ſhortly after this, was received alfo, the prefident&#x27;s  
  
  
which, in treating of the flouriſhing condition of the  
United States, contraſted it with the miſerable, famiſhed,  
and diforganized ſtate of other powers. Much, too,  
was faid in that addreſs of the advantage of our accom-  
modation with Britain, as likewiſe of the favourable dif-  
polition of that power towards as, without the ſlighteſt  
attention being ſhown to the French republic; unleſs  
indeed it was referred to in the picture of diftreſs above  
noticed, as was inferred by the French government, as  
I underſtood from good authority, at the time.  
  
In the courſe of the year 1795, the French govern-  
  
  
which were paffed during the miſſion of Mr. Morris,  
under which our trade had been haraſſed, and had alfo;  
notwithſtanding its ſuſpicion of the contents of the Bri-  
tiſh treaty, ſhown a diſpoſition to aſſiſt us in other caſes,  
and had actually taken meaſures to affiſt us in thoſe of  
  
Spain and the Barbary powers ; yet none of thoſe acts,  
  
0  
  
or of the diſpoſition which produced them, were even  
glanced at in the preſident&#x27;s addreſs to congreſs, although  
it was to be inferred, ſuch notice would have produced  
a good effect, and although it was then as juſt as it was  
politic to notice them. This conduct in che adminiſtra-  
tion was the more extraordinary, from the conſideration  
that thoſe decrees, by whoſe authority our trade was ha-  
raſſed, with the haraſſment itſelf, had been announced  
in former communications to the congreſs, when the  
Britiſh depredations were announced. It ſeemed natural  
therefore, now that ſo much was ſaid upon the ſubject  
of our accommodation with England, that ſomething  
ſhould alſo be ſaid of the repeal of thoſe decrees by the  
French government, as well as of the proots of friendſhip  
it had ſhown vs in other reſpects. But this was nor done.  
Under ſuch circumſtances it was impoſſible for me to  
ſucceed in conciliating the French government towards  
the Britiſh treaty, ſince my efforts were not only not ſe-  
conded in that reſpect by our adminiftration, but abſo-  
Jately counteracted by it. Nevertheleſs I continued to  
purſue the ſame line of conduct that I had done before,  
being reſolved not to relax in my efforts, however unſuc -  
ceſsful I might be. | 3,20 ee  
The ſequel of my miffion exhibits an intereſting but  
painful ſpectacle, the diſtinguiſhing characleriftics  
whereof are, the avowed deciſion of the French govern-  
ment to take ſome meaſure towards ns in conſequence of  
our treaty with England, as illuſtrated by many exam-  
ples; with my efforts to prevent any ſuch meaſure taking  
effect; and the attack made on me by our adminiſtra-  
tion, upon pretexts equally unjuſt, frivolous, apd abſurd.  
This part, therefore, I ſhall reduce to as ſmall a com-  
paſs as poſſible. J n  
On the 15th of February 1796, I called on the mi-  
niſter of foreign affairs, to ſtate to him the diſtreſs of many  
of our citizens, merchants at Paris, on account of their  
claims upon the French government, with a view to en-  
gage his aid for their relief; but was immediately diverted  
from that object by information which he gave me, that  
the directory bad at length made up its mind. how to  
act in regard to our treaty with England; which it con-  
  
66  
fidered as having annulled our treaty of alliance with  
France, from the period of its ratification; and had ap-  
  
inted, or intended to appoint, an envoy extraordinary,  
to repair to Philadelphia to remonſtrate againſt it; adding,  
that he was ordered to ſend me an official note upon the  
ſubject, which he. ſhould accordingly do. I expreſſed  
to, him my great ſurpriſe and concern at the communi-  
cation, and was diſpoſed to enter immediately fully upon  
the ſubject, but was prevented, by obſerving that he  
was upon the point of going out; whereupon ] left him  
for the time“. Ter Lt 45  
I attended him again on the day following, and re-  
monſtrated molt earneſtly againſt the meaſure, urging  
  
  
government from it; offering to enter with him, when-  
ever he thought fit, into a diſcuſſion of his objections to  
our treaty, or any other act of our government; aſſuring  
him that I ſhould not only be always ready to enter with  
him into ſuch explanations, bur, in the preſent inſtance,  
ſhould do it with pleaſure; fince, by being poſſeſſed of  
our view of the ſubject, they would be better able to de-  
cide whether the complaint was well or ill founded, and,  
of courſe, how far it merited to be confidered in that  
light. Upon this occaſion, as upon the preceding one,  
the miniſter declined ſtating any ſpecific &#x27; objections to  
the treaty, or any other act of our government; and  
therefore I could make no ſpecific defence. He ad-  
mitted, however, that the objections 1 had urged tothe

to be ſeen but the waſte and pillage of her commerce,  
ſometimes by ſeveral powers, always by ſome one power;  
and little leſs than anarchy at home; for the ſeeds of  
diſcontent, jealouſy, and diſunion, have been ſcattered  
throughout theſe ſtates, in the courſe of a few years paſt,  
with a waſteful hand. By what means, then, was this  
ſtate of things produced, and why was it produced?  
  
It is well known, that the executive adminiſtration has  
heretofore guided all our meaſures; purſuing, in many  
inſtances, a courſe of policy equally contrary to the pub-  
lic feeling and the public judgment : and it was natural  
to expect that that adminiſtration ſhould now be held  
highly reſponſible for the embarraſſments it has thus  
brought upon our country. But by this attack on me,  
a new topic has been raiſed for diſcuſſion, which has  
draun the public attention from the conduct of the ad-

&#x27; Whether I have performed my duty to my country  
as I ought to have done, in the various, contradictory,  
and embarraſſing ſituations in which J was placed by  
the adminiſtration, is a point upon which my country  
will determine, by the facts and documents ſubmitted to  
it. Upon this point I fear not the reſult, becauſe I have  
the utmoſt confidence in the wiſdom and rectitude of a

Fourth, my appointment to the French republic, with  
  
  
with other members of the ſenate, I had oppoſed in  
many inſtances the meaſures of the adminiſtration, par-  
ticularly in that of the miſſion of Mr. Morris to France,  
  
  
miſſions would produce, in our foreign relations, pre-  
ciſely the ill effect they did produce. ;  
  
  
to the French gavernment the motives of Mr. Jay&#x27;s  
miſſion to London, not as an act of condeſcenſion on  
  
  
of policy, 10 produce tranquillity, aud give ſatisfattion,  
whilſt the negotiation was depending; by which inſtruc  
tions, if the exiſtence of a power to form a commercial  
* treaty was not poſitively denied, yet it was wi  
  
and the contrary evidently implied “. |  
  
Sixth, the ſtrong documents that were put in my  
poſſeſſion at that period, by the adminiltration, of us  
attachment to France and the French revolution; fo  
different from any thing before expreſſed.  
  
Seventh, the reſentment ſhown by the adminiſtration  
on account of the publication of thoſe documents; it  
having been intended they ſhould produce their effect, at  
the. ſame time, and yet be kept ſecret. |  
. Eighth, the approbation beſtowed on me by the ad-  
  
ES: when I made vehement preſſures on the  
French goverament for a repeal of its decrees, under  
which our commerce was haraſſed, exhibiting a picture  
ol its ſpoliations, &amp;c. and the profound filence and inat-  
tention of the adminiſtration, when thoſe decrees were  
repealed, and a diſpoſition ſhown by that government to  
  
aſſiſt us in other caſes. : 2  
Ninth, the power given to Mr. Jay to form a com-  
mercial treaty with England, in the midſt of a war, by  
a ſpecial miſſion, at a time when no ſuch advance was  
made to treat on that ſubject with France, and her ad-  
vances at beſt coolly received. |  
  
Tenth, the withholding from me the contents of that  
treaty until after the meeting of the ſenate ; notwith-  
ftanding the embarraſſment to which J was, in the in-  
terim, perſonally expoſed, in conſequence of the ex-  
planations I had before given to the French govern-  
ment, by order of the- adminiſtration, of the motives  
of the miſſion which produced it; which deportment  
proves clearly that the adminiſtration did not deal fairly  
with me from the commencement.

Eleventh, the ſubmiſſion of the treaty to Mr. Adet  
after the advice of the ſenate, before the ratification of  
the preſident; at a time when, as it appears by ſatiſ-  
factory documents, it was reſolved to ratify it; which ſub-  
miſſion therefore was probably not made to obtain the  
aid of Mr. Adet&#x27;s counſel, in which light it would have  
been improper, eſpecially as it had been withheld from  
his government; but to repel an objection to the can-  
dour, of the adminiftration, in its condutt 1 in preceding

Twelfth, the character of che treaty itſelf, by which  
taccording to the adminiſtration) we have departed from  
the modern rule of contraband, with reſpect to many,  
articles made free by modern treaties; have alſo made  
an arrangement, by which, whilſt it profeſſes not to  
have ſacrificed the right, it has actually and avowedly  
ſanctioned the doctrine and practice of England, in  
ſeizing proviſions at pleaſure, as contraband. of war;  
and have likewiſe yielded the principle, ſo important to  
America, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods.  
  
Thirteenth, the conduct of the adminiſtration after  
the ratification of the treaty, being in all caſes irritable  
towards France; although it was apprehended, the  
Tatification would embroil us with that power; and  
although at a moment when it was propoſed to decline  
the ratification, a moſt ſoothing and humiliating apology  
was drawn, to be preſented to the Engliſh 3

contrary to the public feeling, and the public judg-

before the public seems to be, whether I have merit-

this was a mere political manceuvre, intended doubt-
