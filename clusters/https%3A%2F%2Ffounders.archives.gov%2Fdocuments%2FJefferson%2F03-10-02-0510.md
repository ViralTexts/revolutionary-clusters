The resu!t of your fifty or sixty years of  
  
religious reading you sum up in the four  
words, Be just and good. It is that in  
which all our inquiries must end. What  
all agree in is probably right; what no two  
agree in. most probably wrong. One of  
our fancolored biographers, who paints  
small men as very great. inquired of me  
lately, with real affection too, whether he  
might consider as authentic the change in  
my religion, much spoken of in some cir-  
cles. My answer was: Say nothing of my  
religion. It is known to my God and  
myself alone. Its evidence before the  
world is to be sought in my life. If that  
has been honest and dutiful to society, the  
religion which has regulated it cannot be  
a bad one. Affectionally,
