them, I am induced by the rules “for the administration of  
justice” to a contrary opinion—By the second  
article of that head; general courts martial are to be ordered, as often as the cases  
may require, by the general or officer commanding the troops; and in this instance Mr  
Morgan’s court martial has been ordered by General Wayne. The article further declares,  
that no sentence of a court martial shall be carried into execution, until after the  
whole proceedings shall have been laid before the said general,  
or officer commanding the troops for the time being. Who is meant by the said general?  
The general, who had ordered the court martial: This construction is enforced by several  
considerations. Altho’ the President is the constitutional commander in chief, he will  
seldom be the commander in the field, and he being therefore necessarily absent from the  
scene of action, the arrest of an officer would be continued contrary to the spirit of  
the sixteenth article of the same head, by the time spent in sending backwards and  
forwards to him. Again; the proceedings are to be laid  
before the general, or the officer; that is, before the one or the other, as the one or  
the other may be in the command. The exception, by which no sentence of a general court  
martial in time of peace, extending to the dismission of a  
commissioned officer, shall be carried into execution, until the whole proceedings shall  
be laid before congress, does not affect a case in time of war.  
Consequently in this time of war, the proceedings against Mr Morgan are to be laid  
before the same officer, before whom they would have been laid under the preceding  
clause of the article; that is, General Wayne. And such is the language which follows:  
“All other sentences[“] (that is, except those extending to life or dismission in time  
of peace, or a general officer, in time of peace or war) “may be confirmed and executed  
by the officer ordering the court to assemble, or the commanding officer for the time  
being, as the case may be[“]—The oath, taken by the  
members of a court martial prohibits them from divulging the sentence of the court,  
until it shall be published by the commanding officer;  in no manner intimating thereby, that the publication of it is  
to depend upon the will of another—Farther: in the 13th article of the same head, it is  
directed, that no commissioned officer shall be cashiered or dismissed from the service,  
excepting by order of Congress, or by the sentence of a general  
court martial. Now if we suppose that the President, not being in the field, has  
succeeded Congress in this particular; (as we must suppose, to prevent a link in the  
chain from being broken) there appears to be a contrast between him, and the actual  
commander in the fiel

«case them to be tried and executed, it must ne-  
cessarily follow that it is matter of indifference  
where they were tried;* since, whether tried in  
Florida or within the United States, in virtue of  
orders from the President or of orders from Ge-  
neral Jackson, the power under which they suf.  
fered would have been, with respect to them,  
precisely the same, and fully sanctioned by law;  
in other words, a power competent to their trial

Now, let -us refer to the Rules and Articles of  
War.  
  
We there find that General Officers may ap-  
point General Courts Martial; and that no sen-  
tence of a General Court Martial, in time of peace,  
extending to loss of life, can be carried into exe-  
cution until the proceedings have been laid be  
fore the President; but that all other sentences may  
be confirmed and executed by the officer order-  
ing the court.t Arbuthnot and Ambrister were  
  
tried in time of war, and their conviction was con  
sequently among those “ other sentences,” which  
the General Officer ordering the Court may legal-  
ly confirm and execute,  
  
As relates to Ambrister, General Jackson did  
not entirely concur. with the Court Martial in  
the degree of punishment to be inflicted upon  
him. But this difference of opinion did not arise  
from any doubt of the facts. The Court, ai first.
