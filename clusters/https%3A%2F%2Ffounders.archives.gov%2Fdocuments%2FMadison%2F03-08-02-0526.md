To all and singular to whom these presents shall come, Greeting:  
[18 February 1815]  
  
Whereas a treaty of Peace and Amity between the United States of America, and his Britannic Majesty was signed at Ghent, on the twenty-fourth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, by Plenipotentiaries respectively appointed for that purpose; and the said treaty having been, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, duly accepted, ratified, and confirmed, on the seventeenth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and fifteen; and ratified copies thereof having been exchanged agreeably to the tenor of the said treaty, which is in the words following, to wit:  
  
TREATY OF PEACE AND AMITY BETWEEN HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  
His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, desirous of terminating the war which has unhappily subsisted between the two countries, and of restoring, upon principles of perfect reciprocity, peace, friendship, and good understanding between them, have, for that purpose, appointed their respective plenipotentiaries, that is to say: His Britannic Majesty, on his part, has appointed the right honorable James Lord Gambier, late admiral of the white, now admiral of the red squadron of His Majesty’s Fleet, Henry Goulburn, Esquire, a member of the Imperial Parliament and Under Secretary of State, and William Adams, Esquire, Doctor of Civil Laws: And the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, has appointed John Quincy Adams, James A. Bayard, Henry Clay, Jonathan Russell and Albert Gallatin, citizens of the United States, who, after a reciprocal  
  
communication of their respective full powers, have agreed upon the following articles:  
  
  
ARTICLE THE FIRST.  
There shall be a firm and universal Peace between His Britannic Majesty and the United States, and between their respective countries, territories, cities, towns, and people, of every degree, without exception of places or persons. All hostilities, both by sea and land, shall cease as soon as this Treaty shall have been ratified by both parties, as hereinafter mentioned. All territory, places, and possessions whatsoever, taken from either party by the other, during the war, or which may be taken after the signing of this Treaty, excepting only the islands hereinafter mentioned, shall be restored without delay, and without causing any destruction, or carrying away any of the artillery or other public property originally captured in the said forts or places, and which shall remain therein upon the exchange of the ratifications of this Treaty, or any slaves or other private property. And all archives, records, deeds, and papers, either of a public nature, or belonging to private persons, which, in the course of the war, may have fallen into the hands of the officers of either party, shall be, as far as may be practicable, forthwith restored and delivered to the proper authorities and persons to whom they respectively belong. Such of the islands in the Bay of Passamaquoddy as are claimed by both parties, shall remain in the possession of the party in whose occupation they may be at the time of the exchange of the ratifications of this Treaty, until the decision respecting the title to the said islands shall have been made in conformity with the fourth article of this Treaty. No disposition made by this Treaty, as to such possession of the islands and territories claimed by both parties, shall, in any manner whatever, be construed to affect the right of either.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE SECOND.  
Immediately after the ratifications of this treaty by both parties, as hereinafter mentioned, orders shall be sent to the armies, squadrons, officers, subjects and citizens, of the two powers to cease from all hostilities: And to prevent all causes of complaint which might arise on account of the prizes which may be taken at sea after the said ratifications of this treaty, it is reciprocally agreed, that all vessels and effects which may be taken after the space of twelve days from the said ratifications, upon all parts of the coast of North America, from the latitude of twenty-three degrees north, to the latitude of fifty degrees north, and as far eastward in the Atlantic ocean, as the thirty-sixth degree of west longitude from the meridian of Greenwich, shall be restored on each side: That the time shall be thirty days in all other parts of the Atlantic ocean, north of the equinoctial line or equator, and the same time for the British and Irish channels, for the Gulf of Mexico and all parts of the West Indies: Forty days for the North Seas, for the Baltic, and for all parts of the Mediterranean: Sixty days for  
  
the Atlantic ocean south of the equator as far as the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope: Ninety days for every part of the world south of the equator: And one hundred and twenty days for all other parts of the world, without exception.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE THIRD.  
All prisoners of war taken on either side, as well by land as by sea, shall be restored as soon as practicable after the ratifications of this treaty, as hereinafter mentioned, on their paying the debts which they may have contracted during their captivity. The two contracting parties respectively engage to discharge, in specie, the advances which may have been made by the other for the sustenance and maintenance of such prisoners.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE FOURTH.  
Whereas it was stipulated by the second article in the treaty of peace, of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, between his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, that the boundary of the United States should comprehend all islands within twenty leagues of any part of the shores of the United States, and lying between lines to be drawn due east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries, between Nova Scotia, on the one part, and East Florida on the other, shall respectively touch the Bay of Fundy, and the Atlantic ocean, excepting such islands as now are, or heretofore have been, within the limits of Nova Scotia; and whereas the several islands in the Bay of Passamaquoddy, which is part of the Bay of Fundy, and the island of Grand Menan in the said Bay of Fundy, are claimed by the United States as being comprehended within their aforesaid boundaries, which said islands are claimed as belonging to his Britannic Majesty, as having been at the time of, and previous to, the aforesaid treaty of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three within the limits of the province of Nova Scotia: In order, therefore, finally to decide upon these claims, it is agreed that they shall be referred to two Commissioners to be appointed in the following manner, viz: one Commissioner shall be appointed by his Britannic Majesty, and one by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the said two Commissioners so appointed shall be sworn impartially to examine and decide upon the said claims according to such evidence as shall be laid before them on the part of his Britannic Majesty and of the United States respectively. The said Commissioners shall meet at St. Andrews, in the province of New Brunswick, and shall have power to adjourn to such other place or places as they shall think fit. The said Commissioners shall, by a declaration or report under their hands and seals, decide to which of the two contracting parties the several islands aforesaid do respectively belong, in conformity with the true intent of the said Treaty of Peace of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three. And if the said commissioners shall agree in their decision, both parties shall consider such decision  
  
as final and conclusive. It is further agreed, that in the event of the two Commissioners differing upon all or any of the matters so referred to them, or in the event of both or either of the said Commissioners refusing, or declining, or wilfully omitting, to act as such, they shall make, jointly or separately, a report or reports, as well to the government of his Britannic Majesty as to that of the United States, stating in detail the points on which they differ, and the grounds upon which their respective opinions have been formed, or the grounds upon which they, or either of them, have so refused, declined, or omitted to act. And his Britannic Majesty, and the government of the United States hereby agree to refer the report or reports of the said Commissioners, to some friendly sovereign or state, to be then named for that purpose, and who shall be requested to decide on the differences which may be stated in the said report or reports, or upon the report of one Commissioner, together with the grounds upon which the other Commissioner shall have refused, declined, or omitted to act, as the case may be. And if the Commissioner so refusing, declining, or omitting to act, shall also wilfully omit to state the grounds upon which he has so done, in such manner that the said statement may be referred to such friendly sovereign or state, together with the report of such other Commissioner, then such sovereign or state shall decide ex parte upon the said report alone. And his Britannic Majesty and the government of the United States engage to consider the decision of some friendly sovereign or state to be such and conclusive on all the matters so referred.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE FIFTH.  
Whereas neither that point of the highlands lying due north from the source of the river St. Croix, and designated in the former treaty of peace between the two powers as the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, now the northwesternmost head of Connecticut river, has yet been ascertained; and whereas that part of the boundary line between the dominion of the two powers which extends from the source of the river St. Croix directly north to the abovementioned northwest angle of Nova Scotia, thence along the said highlands which divide those rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic ocean to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut river, thence down along the middle of that river to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude; thence by a line due west on said latitude until it strikes the river Iroquois or Cataraguy, has not yet been surveyed: it is agreed, that for these several purposes two Commissioners shall be appointed sworn, and authorized, to act exactly in the manner directed with respect to those mentioned in the next preceding article, unless otherwise specified in the present article. The said Commissioners shall meet at St. Andrews, in the province of New Brunswick, and shall have power to adjourn to such other place or places as they shall think fit. The said Commissioners shall have power to  
  
ascertain and determine the points abovementioned, in conformity with the provisions of the said treaty of peace of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, and shall cause the boundary aforesaid, from the source of the river St. Croix to the river Iroquois or Cataraguy, to be surveyed and marked according to the said provisions. The said Commissioners shall make a map of the said boundary, and annex to it a declaration under their hands and seals, certifying it to be the true map of the said boundary, and particularizing the latitude and longitude of the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, of the northwesternmost head of Connecticut river, and of such other points of the said boundary as they may deem proper. And both parties agree to consider such map and declaration as finally and conclusively fixing the said boundary. And in the event of the said two Commissioners differing, or both, or, either, of them, refusing or declining, or wilfully omitting to act, such reports, declarations, or statements, shall be made by them, or either of them, and such reference to a friendly sovereign or state, shall be made, in all respects as in the latter part of the fourth article is contained, and in as full a manner as if the same was herein repeated.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE SIXTH.  
Whereas, by the former treaty of peace that portion of the boundary of the United States from the point where the forty-fifth degree of north latitude strikes the river Iroquois or Cataraguy to the lake Superior, was declared to be “along the middle of said river into lake Ontario, through the middle of said lake until it strikes the communication by water between that lake and lake Erie, thence along the middle of said communication into lake Erie, through the middle of said lake until it arrives at the water communication into the lake Huron, thence through the middle of said lake to the water communication between that lake and lake Superior:” And whereas doubts have arisen what was the middle of said river, lakes and water communications, and whether certain islands lying in the same were within the dominions of his Britannic Majesty or of the United States: In order, therefore, finally to decide these doubts, they shall be referred to two Commissioners, to be appointed, sworn, and authorized to act exactly in the manner directed with respect to those mentioned in the next preceding article, unless otherwise specified in this present article. The said Commissioners shall meet, in the first instance, at Albany, in the state of New-York, and shall have power to adjourn to such other place or places as they shall think fit: The said Commissioners shall, by a report or declaration, under their hands and seals, designate the boundary through the said river, lakes, and water communications, and decide to which of the two contracting parties the several islands lying within the said river, lakes, and water communications, do respectively belong, in conformity with the true intent of the said treaty of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three. And both parties agree to consider such designation and  
  
decision as final and conclusive. And in the event of the said two Commissioners differing, or both, or either of them, refusing, declining, or wilfully omitting to act, such reports, declarations or statements, shall be made by them, or either of them, and such reference to a friendly sovereign or state shall be made in all respects as in the latter part of the fourth article is contained, and in as full a manner as if the same was herein repeated.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE SEVENTH.  
It is further agreed that the said two last mentioned commissioners, after they shall have executed the duties assigned to them in the preceding article, shall be, and they are hereby authorized, upon their oaths impartially to fix and determine, according to the true intent of the said Treaty of Peace, of one thousand seven hundrd and eighty-three, that part of the boundary between the dominions of the two powers, which extends from the water communication between lake Huron, and lake Superior, to the most north-western point of the Lake of the Woods, to decide to which of the two parties the several islands lying in the lakes, water communications, and rivers, forming the said boundary, do respectively belong, in conformity with the true intent of the said Treaty of Peace, of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three; and to cause such parts of the said boundary, as require it, to be surveyed and marked. The said Commissioners shall, by a report or declaration under their hands and seals, designate the boundary aforesaid, state their decision on the points thus referred to them, and particularize the latitude and longitude of the most north-western point of the lake of the woods, and of such other parts of the said boundary as they may deem proper. And both parties agree to consider such designation and decision as final and conclusive. And, in the event of the said two Commissioners differing, or both, or either of them refusing, declining, or wilfully omitting to act, such reports, declarations, or statements, shall be made by them, or either of them, and such reference to a friendly sovereign or state, shall be made in all respects, as in the latter part of the fourth article is contained, and in as full a manner as if the same was herein repeated.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE EIGHTH.  
The several boards of two Commissioners mentioned in the four preceding articles, shall respectively have power to appoint a Secretary, and to employ such surveyors or other persons as they shall judge necessary. Duplicates of all their respective reports, declarations, statements and decisions, and of their accounts, and of the journal of their proceedings, shall be delivered by them to the agents of his Britannic Majesty, and to the agents of the United States, who may be respectively appointed and authorised to manage the business on behalf of their respective Governments. The said Commissioners shall be respectively paid in such manner as shall be agreed between the two contracting parties, such agreement being to be settled at the time of the exchange of the ratifications of this  
  
treaty. And all other expences attending the said Commissioners shall be defrayed equally by the two parties. And in the case of death, sickness, resignation, or necessary absence, the place of every such Commissioner respectively shall be supplied in the same manner as such Commissioner was first appointed, and the new Commissioner shall take the same oath or affirmation, and do the same duties. It is further agreed between the two contracting parties, that in case any of the islands mentioned in any of the preceding articles, which were in the possession of one of the parties prior to the commencement of the present war between the two countries, should, by the decision of any of the boards of Commissioners aforesaid, or of the sovereign or state so referred to, as in the four next preceding articles contained, fall within the dominions of the other party, all grants of land made previous to the commencement of the war by the party having had such possession, shall be as valid as if such island or islands, had by such decision or decisions, been adjudged to be within the dominions of the party having had such possession.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE NINTH.  
The United States of America engage to put an end immediately after the ratification of the present Treaty to hostilities with all the tribes or nations of Indians, with whom they may be at war at the time of such ratification; and forthwith to restore to such tribes or nations, respectively, all the possessions, rights, and privileges, which they may have enjoyed or been entitled to in one thousand eight hundred and eleven, previous to such hostilities: Provided always, that such tribes or nations shall agree to desist from all hostilities, against the United States of America, their citizens and subjects, upon the ratification of the present treaty being notified to such tribes or nations, and shall so desist accordingly. And His Britannic Majesty engages, on his part, to put an end immediately after the ratification of the present treaty, to hostilities with all the tribes or nations of Indians with whom he may be at war at the time of such ratification, and forthwith to restore to such tribes or nations, respectively, all the possessions, rights, and privileges, which they may have enjoyed or been entitled to, in one thousand eight hundred and eleven, previous to such hostilities: Provided always, that such tribes or nations shall agree to desist from all hostilities against His Britannic Majesty, and his subjects, upon the ratification of the present treaty being notified to such tribes or nations, and shall so desist accordingly.  
  
  
ARTICLE THE TENTH.  
Whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice, and whereas both His Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition, it is hereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object.  
  
  
  
ARTICLE THE ELEVENTH.  
This Treaty, when the same shall have been ratified on both sides, without alteration by either of the contracting parties, and the ratifications mutually exchanged, shall be binding on both parties, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Washington, in the space of four months from this day, or sooner if practicable.  
In faith whereof, we the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed this treaty, and have thereunto affixed our seals.

ted by the 2d article in the treaty of  
peace of 1783, between his Britannic  
Majesty and the United States of Ame¬  
rica, that the boundary of the United  
States should comprehend *&#x27; all islands  
within twenty leagues of any part of  
the shores of the United States, and ly¬  
ing between lines to be drawn due east  
from the points where the aforesaid  
boundaries between Nova Scotia on the  
one part and East Florida on the other,  
shall respectively touch the Bay of Fun-  
dy and the Atlantic Ocean, excepting  
such islands as now are, or heretofore  
have been, within the limits of Nova  
Scotia and whereas the several is¬  
lands in the Bay of Passamaquoddy,  
which is part of the Bay* of Fundy,  
and the island of Grand Menan, in the  
bay of Fundy, are claimed by the  
United States, as being comprehend¬  
ed within then* aforesaid boundaries,  
which said islands are claimed as be¬  
longing to his Britannic Majesty, as  
having been at the time of, and previous  
to the aforesaid treaty of 1783, with¬  
in the limits of the province of Nova  
Scotia ; in order, therefore, finally, to  
decide upon these claims, it is agreed  
that they shall be referred to two  
commissioners, to be appointed in the  
following manner, viz.—One com-  
  
APPENDIX n—STATE PAPERS.  
  
tKiMsioner shall be appoulted by his  
Britannic Majesty, and one by the Pre¬  
sident of the United States, by and  
with the advice and consent of the se¬  
nate thereof; and the said two com¬  
missioners, so appointed, shall be  
sworn impartially to examine and de¬  
cide upon the said claims, according  
to such evidence as shall be laid before  
them on the part of his Britannic Ma¬  
jesty and of the United States respec¬  
tively. The said commissioners shall  
meet at St Andrews, in the province  
of New Brunswick, and shall have  
power to adjourn to such other place  
or places as they shall think fit. The  
said commissioners shall, by a declara¬  
tion or report under their hands and  
seals,-decide to which of the two con¬  
tracting parties the several islands  
aforesaid do respectively belong, in  
conformity with the true intent of the  
said treaty of peace of 1783: and if  
tite said commissioners shall agree in  
their decision, both parties shall con¬  
sider such decision as final and con¬  
clusive.  
  
It is further agreed, that in the  
event of the two commissioners dif¬  
fering upon all or any of the matters  
so referred to them, or in the event of  
both or either of the said commission¬  
ers refusing or declining, or wilfully  
omitting to act as such, they shall  
make, jointly or separately, report or  
reports, as well to the government of  
his Britannic Majesty, as to that of  
the United States, stating in detail the  
points on which they differ, and the  
grounds upon which their respective  
opinions have been formed, or the  
grounds upon which they, or either  
of them, have so refused, declined, or  
omitted to act. And his Britannic  
Majesty and the government of the  
United States hereby agree to refer  
the report or reports of the said com¬  
missioners to some&#x27; friendly sovereign  
or state, to be then named for that  
purpose, and who shall be requested  
  
to decide on the differences which  
may be stated in the said&#x27;report or re¬  
ports, or upon the report of one com¬  
missioner, together with the grounds  
upon which the other commissioner  
shall have refused, declined, or omit¬  
ted to act, as the case may be. And  
if the commissioner so refusing, de¬  
clining, or omitting to act, shall also  
wilfully omit to state the grounds  
upon which he has so done, in such  
manner that the said statement may be  
referred to such friendly sovereign or  
state, together with the report of  
such other commissioner, that such so¬  
vereign or state shall decide, exparte^  
upon the said report alone; and his  
Britannic Majesty and the government  
of the United States engage to con¬  
sider the decision of such friendly so¬  
vereign or state to be final and con¬  
clusive on all the matters so refer¬  
red.  
  
Art. 5. Whereas neither that point  
of the highlands lying due north from  
the source of the river St Croix, de¬  
signated ill the formei‘ treaty of peace  
between the two powers as the north¬  
west angle of Nova Scotia, nor the  
north-westernmost head of Connecti¬  
cut river, have yet been ascertained ;  
and whereas that part of the boundary  
line between the dominions of the two  
powers, which extends from the source  
of the river St Croix, directly north  
to the above mentioned north-west  
angle of Nova Scotia, thence along  
the said highlands which divide those  
rivers that empty themselves into the  
river St Lawrence, from those which  
fall into the Atlantic Ocean to the  
north-westernmost head of Connecti¬  
cut river, thence down along the mid¬  
dle of that river to the 45th degree of  
north latitude, thence by a line due  
west on said latitude, until it strikes  
the river Iroquois or Cateraguy, has  
rot yet been surveyed, it is agreed  
that for these several purposes two  
commissioners shall be appointed,  
  
cliv

in the manner directed with respect to  
those mentioned in the next preceding  
article, unless otherwise specified in  
the present article. The said com¬  
missioners shall meet at St Andrews,  
in the province of New Brunswick,  
and shall have power to adjourn to  
such other place or places as they shall  
think fit. The said commissioners  
shall have power to ascertain and de¬  
termine the points above mentioned,  
in conformity with the provisions of  
the said treaty of peace of 1788 ; and  
shall cause the boundary aforesaid,  
from the source of the river St Croix  
to the river Iroquois or Cateraguy to  
be surveyed and marked accormng to  
the said provisions ; the said commis¬  
sioners shall make a map of the said  
boyndary, and annex to it a declara¬  
tion under their hands and seals, cer¬  
tifying it to be a true map of the said  
boundary, and particularizing the la¬  
titude and longitude of the north¬  
west angle of Nova Scotia, of the  
north-western head of Connecticut  
river, and of such other points of the  
said boundary as they may deem pro¬  
per : and both parties agree to consi¬  
der such map and declaration as finaU  
ly&#x27; and conclusively fixing the said  
boundary. And in the event of the  
said two commissioners differing, or  
both, or either of them, refusing, de¬  
clining, or wilfully omitting to act,  
such reports, declarations, or state¬  
ments, shall be made by them, or  
either of them, and such reference to  
a friendly sovereign or state shall be  
made in all respects, as in the latter  
part of the fourth article is contained,  
and in as full a manner ^ if the same  
was herein repeated.  
  
Art. 6. Whereas, by the former  
treaty of peace, that portion of the  
boundary of the United States from  
the point where the 4&#x27;5th degree of  
north latitude strikes the river Iro¬  
quois or Cateraguy, to the Lake  
  
Superior, was declared to be « along  
the middle of said river into JL&lt;ake  
Ontario, through the middie of said  
lake, until it strikes the communica¬  
tion by water between that lake and  
Lake Erie, thence along the middle  
of said communication into Lake Erie,  
through the middle of said lak^ until  
it arrives at the prater communication  
into the Lake Huron, thence through  
the middle of said lake to the water  
communication between that lake and  
Lake Superiorand whereas doubts  
have arisen what was the middle of  
the said river, lakes, and water com¬  
munications, and whether certain  
islands lying in the same were within  
the dominions of his Britannic Ma¬  
jesty or of the United states. In  
order, therefore, finally to decide these  
doubts, they shall be referred to two  
commissioners, to be appointed, sworn,  
and authorised to act exactly in the  
manner directed with respect to those  
mentioned in the next preceding article,  
unless otherwise specified in this pre¬  
sent article. The said commissioners  
shall meet, in the first instance, at  
Albany, in the state of New York,  
and shidl have power to adjourn to  
such other place or places as they  
shall think fit. The said commission¬  
ers shall, by a report or declaration,  
under their hands and seals, designate  
the boundary through the said river,  
lakes, and water communications, and  
decide to which of the two contracting  
parties the several islands lying within  
the said rivers, lakes, and water commu¬  
nications, do respectively belong, in  
conformity with the true intent oT the  
treaty of 1788, And both partie

America, desirous of terminating the war which has  
unhappily subsisted between the two countries, and  
of restoring, upon principles of perfect reciprocity,

United States, who, after a reciprocal communica-  
tion of their respective full powers, have agreed  
upon the following artictes.  
  
ARTICLE THE FIRST.  
  
There shall bea firm and universal peace between  
his Britannic majesty and the United States, and  
between their respective countries, territories, cities,  
towns, and people, of every degree, without excep-  
tion of places or persons, All hostilities, both by sea  
and land, shall cease as soon as this treaty shall  
have been ratified by both parties, as hereinafter

other private property. And all archives, records,  
deeds, and papers, either of a public nature, or be-  
longing to private persons, which, in the course of  
the war, may have fallen into the hands of the officers  
of either party, shall be, as far as may be practica-  
ble, forthwith restored and delivered to the proper  
authorities and persons to whom they respectively . _  
belong. Such of the islands in the bay of Passama-  
quoddy as are claimed by both parties, shall remain  
in the possession of the party in whose occupation  
they may be at the time of the exchange of the rati-  
fications of this treaty, until the decision:respecting  
the (itle to the said islands shall have been made in  
conformity with the fourth article of this treaty. No

which might arise on account of the prizes which  
may be taken at sea after the said ratifications of  
this treaty, it is reciprocally agreed, that all ves-  
sels and effects which may be taken after the  
space of twelve days from the said ratifications,  
upon all parts of the coast of North America,  
from the latitude of twenty-three degrees north,

of the West Indies: forty days for the North seas,  
for the Baltic, and for all parts of the Mediterra-  
nean: sixty days for the Atlantic ocean south of the  
equator as far as the latitude of the Cape of Good  
Hope: ninety days for every part of the world south

discharge in specie, the advances which may have  
been made by the other,for the sustenance and main-  
tevance of such prisoners.

the treaty of peace, of one thousand seven hundred  
and eighty-three, between his Britannic majesty and  
the United States of America, that the boundary of  
the United States should comprehend all islands

int “Luke Ontario, through the middle of said lake  
until it strikes the communication by water between

said communication into lake Brie, through the middle  
of said lake until it arrives at the water communication  
into the ** lake Huron, thence through the middle of  
“saidlake tothe water communication between that  
‘lake and lake Superior.” And whereas doubts have  
arisen what was the middle of said river, lakes and  
water communications, and whether certain islands  
lying in the same, were within-the dominions of His  
  
ritannic Majesty or of the United States : In order,  
therefore, finally to decide these doubts, they shall be  
referred to two Commissioners, to be appointed, sworn  
and authorised to act exactly in the manner directed  
with respect to those mentioned in the next preceding  
article, unless otherwise specified in this present arti-  
cle.—The said Commissioners shall meet, in the first  
instance, at Albany, in the state ot New-York, and shall

The said Commissioners shall, by a report or decla-  
ration, under their hancs and seals, designate the boun-  
dary through the said river, lakes, and water com-  
munications, and decide to which of the twe contract-

treaty of one thousand seven hundre i and eighty three.  
And both parties agree to consider such designation  
and decisions as final and conclusive. And in the  
event of the said two Commissioners differing, or  
both, or either of them, refusing, declining, or wilfully  
Omitting to act,such reports, declarations or statements,  
shall be made by them, or either of them, and such  
reference to a friendly sovereign or state shall be made  
in all respects as in the latter part of the fourth article  
is contained, and in as fulla manner as if the same

intent of the said Treaty of Peace, of one thousand  
seven and eighty three, that part of the  
  
between the dominions of the two powers,  
which extends from the water communication between  
lake Huron and lake Superior, to the most north-  
western point of the Lake of the Woods, to decide to  
which of the two parties the several islands lying in  
the lakes, water communicauons and rivers forming  
the said boundary,do respectively belong, in conformity  
with the true intent of the said Treaty of Peace, of  
one thousand seven hundred and eighty three ; and to  
cause such parts of the said boundary, as require it,  
to be surveyed and marked, ‘The said commissioners  
shall, by a report or declaration under their hands anc  
seals, designate the boundary afvresaid, state their  
decision on the points thus referred to them, and  
particularize the latitude and longitude of the most  
north-western point of the Lake of the Woods, and of  
such other part of the said boundary as they may deem  
proper.—And both parties agree to consider such de-  
signation and decision as final and conclusive. And,  
in the event of the said two commissioners differing, or  
both, or either of them refusing, declining, or wilfully  
omitting to act, such reports, declarations, or state-  
ments, shall be made by them, cr either of them, and  
such reference toa friendly sovereign or state, shall be  
made in all respects, as in the latter part of the fourth  
article is contained, and in as fulla manner as if the  
’ game was herein repeated.  
  
ARTICLE THE EIGHTH.

nees attending the said  
  
parties. And in the case of death, sickness, resigna-  
tion or necessary absence, the place of every such  
Commissioner respectively shall be supplied in the  
same manner as such Commissioner was at first ap-  
pointed, and the new Commissioner shall take the  
game oath or affirmation, and do the same duties. It  
is further agreed between the two contracting parties,  
that in case any of the islands mentioned in any of the  
preceding articles, which were in the possession of  
one of the parties prior to the commencement of the  
present war between the two countries, should, by  
the decision of any of the boards of Commissioners  
aforesaid, or of the sovereign or state so referred to,  
as in the four next preceding articles contained, fall  
within the dominions of the other party, all grants of  
land made previous to the commencement of the war  
by the party having had such possession, shail be as  
valid as if such island or islands, had by such decision  
or decisions, been adjudged to be within the dominions  
of the party having such possession.

islands aforesaid do respectively belong, in

Treaty of Peace of one thousand seven  
hundred and eighU -three. And if the said  
commissioners shall agree in (heir decision,  
both parlies shall consider such decision as  
final and conclusive. It is further agreed, |  
that in the event of the two commissio!!-  
ers differing upon all or any of the matters

points on which they differ, and the grounds  
upon which their respective opinions have  
been formed, or the grounds u[)on which  
they, or either of them, have so refused, de¬

sioner, together with the grounds upon  
which the other commissioner shall have  
refused; declined, or omitted to act, as the  
case may be. And if the commissioner so

also w ilfully omit to state the grounds upon  
which he has so done, in such manner that  
the said statement may be referred to such  
friendly sovereign or state, together with  
the re|)ort of such other cornmissioiier, then  
such sovereign or state shall decide ex parte

Whereas neither that point of the high¬

northwesternmost head of Connecticut ri¬

cauise the boundary aforesaid, from the  
source of the river St. Croix to the river  
Iroquois or Cataraguy, to be surveyed and  
marked according to the said provisions.  
The said commissioners shall make a map  
of the said boundary, and annex to it a de¬  
claration under their hands and seals, cer¬  
tifying it to be the true map of the said  
boundary, and particularising the latitude  
and longitude of the northwest angle of  
Nova Scotia, of the north western most head  
of Connecticut river, and of such other  
points of the said boundary as they may  
deem proper. And both parties agree to  
consider such map and declaration as final¬  
ly and conclusively fixing the said bounda¬  
ry. And in the event of the said two com¬  
missioners ditfering, or both,oreitherof them  
refusing or declining, or wilfully omitting  
to act, such reports, declarations, or state¬

them, and such reference to a friendly so¬  
vereign or state, shall be n^ade, in all re¬  
spects as in the latter part of the fourth arti¬  
cle is contained, and in as full a manner as  
if the same was herein repeated.  
  
ARTICLE THE SIX&#x27;PH.  
  
Whereas by the former treaty of peace  
that portion of the boundary of the United  
States from the point where the forty-fifth  
degree of north latitude strikes the river  
Iroquois or Cataraguy, to the Lake Supe¬  
rior, was declared to be “ along the middle  
of said river into Lake Ontario, through the  
middle of said lake un-tH it strikes the com¬  
munication by water between that lake and  
Lake Erie, thence along the middle of said  
communication into Lake Erie, through  
the middle of said lake until it arrives at  
the water cemmunicatioii into the ‘ Lake  
Huron, thence through the middle of said  
lake to the water communication between  
that lake and Lake Superior.’” And  
whereas doubts have arisen what was the  
middle of said river, lakes and water com^  
wunications, and whether certain islands  
lying in the same were within the domi¬  
nions of his Britannic Majesty or of the  
United States: In order, therefore, finally  
to decide these doubts, they shall be refer¬  
red to two commissioners, to be appointed,  
sworn, and authorized to act exactly in the  
manner directed with respect to those men¬  
tioned in the next preceding article, unless  
olherwise specified in this present article.  
&#x27;The said commissioners shall meet, in the  
first instance, at Albany, in the state of  
Ne^Y-York, and shall have power to ad¬  
  
journ to such other place or places as they  
shall think fit. The said commissioners  
shall, by a reiiort or declaration, under their  
hands and seals, designate the boundary  
through the said river, lakes, and water  
communications, and decide to which of  
the two contracting parties the several isl¬  
ands lying within the said river, lakes and  
water communications, do re8[)ectively be¬  
long, ill conformity with the true intent of  
the said treaty of one thousand seven hun¬  
dred and eighty-three. And both parties  
agree to consider such designation and de¬  
cision as final and conclusive. And in the  
event of the said two commissioners differ¬  
ing, or both, or either of them, refusing, de¬  
clining, or wilfully omitting to act, such  
reports, declarations, or statements shall be  
made by them, or either of them, and such  
reference to a friendly sovereign or state  
shall be made in all respects as in the lat¬  
ter part, of the fourth article is contained,  
and in as full a manner as if the same was  
herein repeated.  
  
ARTICLE THE SEVENTH.  
  
It is further agreed that the said two last  
mentioned commissioners, after they shall  
have exeeutf^d the duties assigned to them  
in the preceding articles, shall be, and they  
are hereby authorized, upon their oaths im¬  
partially to fix and determine, according to  
the true intent of the said treaty of peace,  
of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-  
three, that part of the boundary between  
the dominions of the two powers, which ex¬  
tend from the water communication be¬  
tween Lake Huron and Lake Superior, to the  
most northwestern point of the Lake of the  
Woods, to decide to w hich of the two par¬  
ties the several islands lying in the lakes,  
water communications, and rivers, forming  
the said boundary, do respectively belong,  
in conformity with the true intent of the  
said treaty of peace, of one thousand seven  
hundred and eighty-three; and to cause  
such parts of the said boundary, as require  
it, to be surveyed and marked.&#x27; The said  
commissioners shall, by a report or declara¬  
tion under their hands and seals, designate  
the boundary aforesaid, state their decision  
on the points thus referred to them, and par¬  
ticularise the latitude and longitude of the  
most north western point of the Lake of the  
Woods, and of such other part of the said  
boundary as they may deem proper. And  
both parties agree to consider such designa¬  
tion and decision as final and conclusive*  
And in the event of the said tw(^ commis-

fiioners differing, or both, or either of them  
refusing, declining, or wilfully omitting to  
act, such reports, declarations, or statements,  
shall be made by them, or either of them,  
and such reference to a friendly sovereign  
or stale, shall be made in all respects, as in  
the latter part of the fourth article is con¬  
tained, and in as full a manner as if the same  
was herein repeated.  
  
ARTICLE THE EIGHTH.  
  
The several boards of two commission¬  
ers, mentioned tn the four preceding arti¬  
cles, shall respectively have [K)wer to ap¬  
point a secretary, and to employ such sur¬  
veyors or other persons as they shall judge  
necessary. Duplicates of all their respec¬  
tive reports, declarations, statements and  
decisions, and of their accounts, and of the  
Journal of their proceedings shall be deli¬  
vered by them to the agents of his Britan¬  
nic Majesty, and to the agents of the Uni¬  
ted States, wHo may be respectively ap¬  
pointed and authorized to manage the busi¬  
ness on behalf of their respective govern¬  
ments. The said commissioners shall be  
respectively paid in such manner as shall  
be agreed between the two contracting par¬  
ties, such agreement being to be settled at  
the time of the exchange of the ratifications  
of this treaty. And all other expenses at¬  
tending the said commissioners shall be de¬  
frayed equally by the two parties. And in  
the case of death, sickness, resignation or  
necessary absence, the place of every sucli  
commissioner respectively shall be suppli¬  
ed in the same manner as such commission¬  
er was first appointed, and the new com¬  
missioner shall take the same oath or affir¬  
mation, and do the same duties. It is fur¬  
ther agreed between the two contract¬  
ing parties, that in case any of the islands  
mentioned in any of the preceding articles,  
which w&#x27;ere in the possession of one of the  
parties prior to the commencement of the  
present war between the two countries,  
should, by the decision of any of the boahls  
of commissioners aforesaid, or of the sove-;  
reign or state so referred to, as in the four  
next preceding articles contained, fall with¬  
in the dominions of the other party, all  
grants of land made previous to the com¬  
mencement of the war by the party having  
had such possession, shall be as valid as if  
such island or islands, had by such decision  
or decisions, been a^udged to be within the  
dominions of the party having such posses¬  
sion.  
  
ARTICLE THE NINTH.  
  
The United States of America engage to put  
  
an end immcdiat^dj after the ratification of th®  
present Treaty to hostilities with all the tribes

ARTICLE THE TENTH.  
  
Whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable  
w ith tlie principles of humanity and Justice, and  
whereas i&gt;Jth his Majesty and the United State!

ARTICLE IHE FIFTH.  
Wheress unclr her thar poiat of the high  
I nds lying due north from the source of the  
river St. Crovx, and designated in the former  
treaty of peacc berween the two powers as  
the norch-west angle of Nova Bcotia, now’  
the norith westernmost head of Connecticut  
- river, has yet been ascertained ; abd where­  
aß that part of the boundary line between  
the dominion of the two powesrs which ex­  
teads from the source of the river St, Croix  
directly north to the abovementioned north­  
- west angle of Nova-Scetia, theuce along the  
said highlands which divide those rivers ihat  
emp&#x27;y themselves into the river Si. Law­  
rence from those which fall inte the Atlantic  
ocean to the norta-westernmest head of Con­  
neciicut river, thence down alonz the middle  
of that river to the forty-fifih degrecof north  
latitude ; thence by a lihe due west on said  
iatitude until it strikes the river Irequois or  
Cataraguy, has got yet been surveyed; it is  
agreed, that for these several purposes, two  
commissioners shall bz appointed, sworn, and  
authorized, to act exactly in the manner di­  
rected with respest to those mentioned in the  
next preceding article, uaniess otherwise  
specified in the presem article. The ssid  
Commissioners shall meet at St. Andrews,  
in the province of New-Brunswick, and shali  
have power to adjourn to such other place or  
places as they shall think fit,. The said  
Commissioners shall have power to ascer.  
tain and determine the points abovemen­  
tioned, in cenformity with (he provisions of  
the said treaty of peace of one thousand  
sevem hundred and eighty theee, and shall  
cause the boundary =sforesaid, from the  
souree of the river Bt. Cicix to the river I­  
roquois or Cataraguy, to be surveyed and  
mezrked ®ccordiog to the said provisicss.  
The said Commissioners shall make a map  
of the said boundary, and ennextoiva de.  
eiaration under their hands end seals, cer­  
tifying 1t to be the true map of the said  
boundary, and particelarizing the latitude  
end longttude of the northwest angle of Neo­  
va Scotia, of the northwesternmost head of  
Conneciicut river, and of sush otuer poins  
of the said beoundary as they may deem  
proper. And both partics agree to consider  
such map and deciaration as finally and con  
clusively fixiog the said boundary. And in  
the event of the said two Commiseioners dif­  
fering, or buth, or either of them, refusiog or  
declining, or wilfully omitting toact, such re­  
ports, dcclaratfons, or statements, shall be  
made by them, or either of them, and such  
reference to a friendly sovereign or state,  
shall be made, in all respects as in the latter  
part of the foarth artiele is contained, and in  
as full 2 maoner as if the same was herein  
repeated. : -  
  
2 ARTICLE THE SIXTH.  
Whereas, by the former treaty of peace  
that portion of the boundary es the United  
States, from&#x27;the point where the forty-fifth  
degree of north latitude strikes the river  
Iroquois or Cataraguy, to the Lake Supe­  
rior, was declared to be * along the mid­  
dle of said river into lake Outario, through  
the middle of said lake until it strikes the  
communication by water between that lake  
and lake Erie, thence along the middle of  
said eommunication into lake Erie, through  
the middle of said lake until it arrives at  
the water communication into the lake Hu.  
rogy thence through the middle of said  
lake to’ the water communication between  
that lake and lake Superior.’” And wher­  
as doub:s have arisen what was the widdle  
of {aid river, lakes and water:communica­  
tions, and whether certain_iflands lving in  
the fame, were within the dominions of His  
Britannic Majesty or of.the United States :  
In order, therefore, finally to decide these  
doubts, they shall be referred toe two com.  
missioners, to be appointed, sworn, and au­  
thorifed to a&amp; exaltly in the manner dire&amp;t­

“ arrives at the water communication into the  
“ lake Huron, thence through the middle of  
“ said lake to the water communication be-  
“ tween that lake and lake Superior And  
whereas doubts have arisen what was the mid-  
dle of said river, lakes and water communica-  
tions, and whether certain islands lying in the  
same were within the dominions of his Britan-  
nic Majesty or of the U. States : In order,  
therefore, finally to decide these doubts, they

shall be made by them, or either of them, and  
such reference to a friendly sovereign or state

of the two powers, wnich extends from  
the water communication between lake  
Huron, and lake Superior, to the most  
north-western point of the Lake of the  
VV&#x27;oods, to decide to which of the two  
parties the several islands lying in the  
lakes, water communications, and rivers,  
forming the said bourdary, do respec-  
tively belong, in conformity with the true  
intent of the said Treaty of Peace, of one

designation and decision as final and con-  
clusive. And, in the event of the said  
two Commissioners differing, or both or  
either of them refusing, declining, or wil-

ed, fall within tiie dominions of the other

ARTICLE THE FOURTH.  
Whereas it was stipulated by the second  
article in the treaty of peace, of one thou­  
sand seven hundred and eighty-three, be­  
tween his Britannic Majesty and the Uni­  
ted Slates of America, that the boundary of  
the United States should comprehend all  
islands within twenty leagues of any part  
of the shores of the United States, and lay­  
ing between lines to be drawn due east  
from the points where the aforesaid boun­  
daries, between Nov.i Scotia, on the one  
part, and East Florida on the other, shall  
respectively touch the. Bay of Fundy, and  
the Atlantic ocean, excepting such islands  
as now are, or heretofore have been, with­  
in (he limits of \ova Scotia; and whereas  
the several islands in the Bay of Passama­  
quoddy, which is pari of the Bay of Fun­  
dy, and the inland of Grand Menan in the  
said Bay of Fundy, are claimed by the  
United States being comprehended  
within their aforesaid boundaries, which  
said islands are claimed as belonging to his  
Britannic Majesty,as havi tig been at (lie i  
time of, and previous to, the aforesaid (  
treaty of one thousand seven hundred and J  
eighty-three within the limits of the pro- f  
vinceof Nova Scotia: In order, therefore, |  
finally to decide upon these claims, it is |  
agreed that tliey shall lie referred to two &lt;  
Commissioners to be appointed in the 10l- ]  
lowing manner, viz. one Commissioner *  
shall be appointed by his Britannic Ma- i  
jesty, and one by the President of the U. i  
S. by and with ihe advice and consent of |  
the Sen ate thereof, and the said (wo Com- I  
inissioners so appointed shall be sworn im- &lt;  
partially to examine and decide upon the t  
said claims according to such evidence as I  
shall be laid before them 011 the part of his I  
Biitanrtic Majesty and of the United States &lt;  
respectively. The said Commissioners &#x27;•  
shall meet al St. Andrews, in (he province &lt;  
oi New Urutiswick, and shall have power &#x27;•  
lo ndj urn (o such other place or places as  
they shall think fit. The said Commis­  
sioners shall, by a declaration or report  
under their hands and seals, decide h&gt; 1  
which of (he two contracting parties the  
several islands aforesaid do respectively  
belong, in conformity with the true intent 1  
ot the said Treaty 0! Peace of one thou­  
sand seven hundred and eighty-three.  
And if the said commissioners shall a&lt;rrce  
in (heir decision, both parlies shall consi- ■  
der such decision as final and conclusive.  
It is further agreed, that in the event of  
the two commissioners differing upon all  
or any of the matters so referred to them,  
or 111 the event of both or either of the said :  
commissioners refusing, or declining, or  
wilfully omitting, to act as such, they shall  
make jointly or separately, a Report or  
reporis, as well to the government of his  
Britannic Majesty as (o that of the United  
States, stating in detail the points on which  
they differ, and the grounds upon which  
their respective opinions have been form­  
ed, or the grounds upon which tliey or  
citner of (hem, have so refused, declined,  
or omitted to act. And his Britannic Ma­  
jesty, and the government of (he U­  
niled Stales hereby agree to refer the  
report or reporis of the sdd Commis­  
sions 1 (o some friendly sovereign or  
state, to be then named for that &#x27;purpose,  
and whoslinll be requested to decide on  
the differences which may be slated in the  
sau report or reports, or upon the report  
ot one Commissioner, together with the  
grounds upon which the other Commis­  
sioners shall have refused, declined, or  
oinited to act, as the case may be. And  
if the Commissioner so refusing, declining,  
or omitting to act, shall also wilfuMy  
omit to stale the grounds upon which he  
has so done, in such manner that the said  
statement may be referred to such friendly  
sovereign or stale, together with the re­  
port ot such other Commissioner, then  
such sovereign or state shall decide es­  
parto upon the said report alone. And  
Ins Britannic .Majesty and the government  
of the United Slates engage to consider  
the decision of some friendly sovereign  
or slate to be such and conclusive on all  
■ the matters so referred.  
ARTICLE THE FIFTH.  
t Whereas neither (hat point of Hie InVli.  
I landslying clue north from the source of  
the river Si. Croix, and designated in the  
former treaty of peace between the two  
powers as the northwest aiigfc of Nova  
■ Scotia, now the norlhwesternmost head  
! of Connecticut river has yet been ascer­  
l tained ; and whereas that part of the botin-  
I dary line between the dominion of the two  
» powers which extends from the source of  
. the river St. Croix directly north to the  
s abovementioned northwest angle of Nova  
- Scotia, thence along the said highlands  
- which divide those rivers that empty  
; themselves into the river St. Lawrence  
3 from those which fall into the Atlantic  
1 ocean to the north westernmost head of  
i Connecticut river, thence down along the  
s middle of that river to the 45th degree of  
north latitude; tliencc by a line due west  
on said latitude until it strikes the rivet  
Iroquois or Cataraqui, lias not yet been  
surveyed: it is agreed that for these several  
purposes two Commissioners shall be ap­  
pointed, sworn, and authorised, to act  
exactly in the manner directed with res­  
pect lo those mentioned in the next pre­  
ceding article, unless otherwise specified  
in the present article. The said Commis­  
sioners shall meet at St. Andrews, in the  
province of New Brunswick, and shall  
have power to adjourn (o such other place  
or places as they shall think fit. The said  
Commissioners shall have power to ascer­  
tain and determine the points abovemen­  
tioned, in conformity with the provisions  
of the said treaty of peace of one thousand  
seven hundred and eighty three, and shall  
cause the boundary aforesaid from the  
source of the river St. Croix to the river  
Iroquois or Cataraqui, to be surveyed and  
marked according to the said provisions.  
The said Commissioners shall make a map  
ot I lie said boundary, and annex t &gt; it a decla­  
ration under their hands and seals, cerfifi­  
ing it lo be the true map of the said boun*  
dary, and particularizing the latitude and  
longitude of the northwest angle of iNova  
Scotia, of the north western most head of  
Connecticut river, and of such other points  
ot (he said boundary as they may deem  
proper. And both parties agree to consi­  
der such map and declaration as finally  
and conclusively fixing the said boundary.  
And in the event of the said (wo Commis­  
sioners differing, or both, or either of them,  
refusing or declining, or wilfudy omitting  
to act, such reports, declarations, or state­  
rni&#x27;hls, shall be made by them, or either  
of (hem, and such reference to a friendly  
sovereign or slate, shall be made, in all res­  
pects as in the latter part of (lie fourth  
article is contained, and in as full a man­  
ner as if the same was herein repealed.  
ARTICLE THE SIXTH.  
Whereas, by (he former treaty of peace  
that portion of the boundary of the Uniled  
States from the point where *he forty.fifth  
degree of north latitude strikes the river  
Iroquois or Cataraguy to the lake Superior,  
was declared to be &quot; along the middle of  
said river into lake Onlario, through the  
middle of said lake until is strike (he com­  
munication by water between that lake and  
lake Rrie, thence along the middle of said  
communicalion into lake Eric, through the  
middle of said lake nntil it arrives at the  
water communication into (he lake Huron,  
(hence through the middle of said lake to (he  
water communication between that lake and  
lake Superior:&quot; And whereas doubts have  
arisen what was the middle of said river,  
lakes and wafer communications, and whether

several islands in the Bay of Passamaquoddy,  
which is part of the Bay of Fundy, and the island  
of ta Menan in the said Bay of Fundy, are  
claimed by the United States as being compre-  
hended within their aforesaid boundaries, which  
said islands are claimed as belonging to his Britan-

rectly north to. the abovementioned’nortiiiwest  
angle of Nova Scotia, thence along. the said high  
lands which divide those rivers that empty thein-  
selves into the river St. Lawrence froin those  
which fall into the Atlantic occan to the north-  
westermost head of Connecticut river, thence  
down along the middle of the river to. the forty-  
fifth degree of north latitude; thence, by a. line  
due west on said latitude until it strikes the river

Mr. PUGH. It seems to me, sir, that this is

as read by the Senator from Virginia, which were  
signed at Ghent, it was stipulated that the British  
forces, in retiring, should restore all the property  
of every description which had been taken from  
the people of the United States within their ter-  
  
rituries, and slaves were specially mentioned in |

I will first call the attention of the House to the  
various provisions of the various treaties upon the  
subject, and afterwards will ask its attention to  
this bill in connection with these various provis-  
ions. The same dispute arose under the treaty of  
Ghent that had arisen upon the revolutionary  
treaty. Great Britain claimed that she was under  
no obligation to pay for slaves which had escaped  
during the war, for the purpose of being enrolled  
in her legions, or otherwise, or had been trans

The fourth article of the treaty of Ghent re-  
ferred to the boundary question. It recited that,  
whereas certain stipulations had been agreed  
upon by the treaty of 1783, concerning the  
islands that were to belong to the United States,  
and whereas the several islands in the Bay of  
Passamaquoddy, which was part of the Bay of  
Fundy, and the Island of Menan in the Bay of  
Fundy, were claimed by the United States, as  
being within their boundaries, and also claimed  
by Great Britain, as within the limits of the  
Province of Nova Scotia, in order to decide the  
matter two Commissioners shall be appointed,  
whose decision shall be final and conclusive.  
In the event of the Commissioners disagreeing,  
they should make reports, jointly or separately,  
in detail, of all the evidences and their opinions,  
and the reports should be submitted to some  
friendly sovereign or State, who should be re-  
quested to decide upon the differences, when  
the decision should be taken as final.

Article 2, which is the most Im­  
portant of the eleven articles in this  
irstance, provides for limmediate  
orders to be given, after the ratifica­  
tion of the treaty by bcth parties, to  
the armies, squadrons, officers, sub­  
jects and citizens of the two powers  
to cease from all hostilities.  
  
In order to prevent causes of com­  
plaint which might arise on account  
of the prizes which may be taken at  
sea after the said ratifications are  
made, the powers also agree that all  
vessels and effects which may be  
taken after the space of twelve days  
from the said ratifications, upon all  
parts of the coast of North America,  
from the latitude of 23 degrees north  
to the latitude of 50 degrees north,  
and as far eastward in the Atlantic  
occean as the thirty-sixth degree of  
west longitude from the meridian of  
Greenwich, shall be restored on each  
side. In all other parts of the  
Atlantic ocean thirty days is the  
limit; forty Uays in the North sea,  
the Baltic and all parts of the Medi­  
terranean; sixty days for the Atlantic  
ocean south of the equator, as far as  
the latitude of Good Hope; ninety  
days for every other part of the  
world south of the equator, and 120  
days for all other parts of the world  
withcut exception.  
Such latitude is no longer neces­  
sary, on account of the quickened  
manner of sending the news by  
cable all over the world.  
  
Article 3 provides for the restora­  
tion of war prisoners, debts which  
they have contracted during their  
captivity to be paid by their res­  
pective countries.  
Article 4 ratifies the bcuadaries  
of the countries as existing before  
the war.  
Articles 5 and 6 further describe  
boundaries and the cession of ter­  
ritory.  
In article 7 commissioners are ap­  
pointed to survey and mark certain  
territories fthat h:ve been ceded.  
Article 8 describes the officials  
which shall be employed under the  
surveying commission and the pay­  
ment of these parties.

of hostilities with all Indian tribes  
on the part .f the United States and
