ountry as far as the river Illinois. the nearest Spanish settlements at this time were on the river Panuco, to the West, 100. leagues from the Misipi, and at Pensacola, to the East leagues distant. there does not appear as yet indeed to have been any formal declaration of the limits of Louisiana: but the practice of nations, on making discoveries in America, has sanctioned a principle that ‘when a nation takes possession of any extent of sea-coast, that possession is understood as extending into the interior country to the sources of the rivers emptying within that coast, to all their branches, &amp; the country they cover.’ 1. Mem. de l’Amerique 116. it was in support of this principle of virtual and declared possession, that France entered into the war of 1755 against Great Britain, whose settlements began now to reach the Eastern waters of the Misipi, and who opposed the claim of France, not on a denial of this principle, but on a prior possession taken &amp; declared by repeated charters, thro’ the space of an hundred years

ent of Sep. 14. 1712. by which Louis XIV. grants to the Sieur Anthony Crozat the exclusive commerce of that country for 15. years. the following extracts from it ascertain the extent of the country.  
‘Louis by the grace of god, king of France &amp; Navarre to all &amp;c.  
‘The care we have always had to procure the welfare &amp; advantage of our subjects having induced us &amp;c. to seek for all possible opportunities of enlarging &amp; extending the trade of our American colonies, we did, in the year 1683. give our orders to undertake a discovery of the countries &amp; lands which are situated in the Northern part of America, between New France &amp; New Mexico: &amp; the Sieur de la Sale, to whom we committed that enterprize, having had success enough to confirm a belief that a communication might be settled from New France to the gulph of Mexico, by means of large rivers; this obliged us, immediately after the peace of Ryswick, to give orders for the establishing a colony there, &amp; maintaining a garrison, which has kept and preserved the possession we had taken in the very year 1683. of the lands, coasts &amp; islands which are situated in the gulph of Mexico, between Carolina on the East, &amp; Old &amp; New Mexico on the West. but a new war having broke out in Europe shortly after, there was no possibility till now, of reaping from that new colony the advantages that might have been expected from thence &amp;c. And whereas upon the information we have recieved, concerning the disposition and situation of the said countries known at present by the name of the province of Louisiana, we are of opinion that there may be established therein a considerable commerce &amp;c. we have resolved to grant the commerce of the country of Louisiana to the Sieur Anthony Crozat &amp;c. For these reasons &amp;c. we, by these presents, signed by our hand, have appointed, &amp; do appoint the said Sieur Crozat to carry on a trade in all the lands possessed by us, and bounded by New Mexico, &amp; by the lands of the English of Carolina, all the establishment, ports, havens, rivers, &amp; principally the port &amp; haven of the Isle Dauphine, heretofore called Massacre, the river of St. Louis, heretofore called Missisipi, from the edge of the sea as far as the   
* The French &amp; Spaniards called by the name of the Illinois, or Illinois country, the whole country on both sides of the Upper Misipi. that on the Eastern side was called East Illinois, that on the West side West Illinois.  
Illinois; together with the river St. Philip, heretofore called the Missourys, and of St Jerome, heretofore called Ouabache, with all the countries, territories, lakes within land, and the rivers which fall directly or indirectly into that part of the river St. Louis.’  
  
The Articles. I. Our pleasure is that all the aforesaid lands, countries, streams, rivers &amp; islands be, and remain comprised under the name of the government of Louisiana, which shall be dependant upon the general government of New France, to which it is subordinate: &amp; further that all the lands which we possess from the Illinois be united &amp;c. to the general government of New France, &amp; become part thereof &amp;c.’ [here follow 15. other articles relating to commerce only] ‘Given at Fontainebleau the 14th. day of Sep. in the year of grace 1712. and of our reign the 70th. Louis. by the King Phelipeaux.’  
Here then is a solemn &amp; public declaration sufficiently special to shew that all the waters running directly or indirectly into the Misipi, and the country embraced by them, are held and acted on by France, u

War breaking out between them in 1718. the French took Pensacola; the Spaniards retook it, but the French recovered &amp; retained it till the peace in 1719 when it was restored to Spain; and from this epoch the river Perdido has been the acknoleged and undisturbed boundary between Louisiana and Florida.  
The boundaries of Louisiana then, as held by France, were the seacoast &amp; islands from the river Perdido to the Rio Norte or Bravo, then up the Rio Bravo to it’s source; thence to the highlands encompassing the waters of the Misipi, and along those highlands round the heads of the Missouri &amp; Misipi &amp; their waters to where those highlands assume the name of the Alleganey or Apalachian mountains, thence along those mountains, and the highlands encompassing the waters of the Mobile, to the source of the Perdido, &amp; down that to the ocean.  
In opposition to these claims, both of France and Spain, were those of the then English colonies, now the US. whose charters extended from sea to sea, and consequently covere

approval of Sir Robert Phillimore. ‘‘ The first of these is,  
that when any European nation takes possession of any  
extent of sea-cuast, that possession is understood as ex-  
tending into the interior country, to the sources of the  
rivers emptying within that coast, to all their branches,  
and the country they cover, and to give it a right, in ex-  
clusion of all other nations, to the same. . . . The  
second is, that whenever one European nation makes a  
discovery and takes possession of any portion of that con-  
tinent, and another afterwards does the same at some dis-

on of a part  
thereof have often arisen and have proved  
sometimes hard of solution. Three  
rules on this subject were propounded and  
maintained by the Commissioners of the  
United States in the negotiations conducted by  
them in 1817 with the Commissioners of Spain  
in regard to the western boundary of Louisi-  
ana. These principles, say the Commission-  
ers, have been adopted in practice by the  
European Powers as applicable to the discov-  
eries and acquisitions made in the New World.  
They are few, simple, and intelligible, and at  
the same time are founded in strict justice.  
  
‘*(1.) When any European nation takes posses-  
sion of any extent of seacoast, that possession  
is understood as extending into the interior  
country to the sources of the rivers emptying  
themselves within that coast, to all their  
branches and to the country they cover, and  
to give it a right in exclusion of all other na-  
tions to the same.  
  
**(2.) Whenever one European nation makes  
a discovery and takes possession of any part  
of that continent, and another afterwards  
does the same at some distance from it, where  
the boundary between them is not determined  
by the principle above mentioned the middle  
distance becomes such of course.”
