dear Sir,  
Mount Vernon Decr 28th 1783  
  
After as prosperous a journey as could be expected at this season of the year, I arrived at my seat the day before Christmas, having previously divested myself of my official character—I am now a private Citizen on the banks of the Potomack, where I should  
be happy to see you if your public business would ever permit and where, in the meantime, I shall fondly cherish the remembrance of all your former friendship.  
Altho’ I scarcely need tell you how much I have been satisfied with every instance of your public conduct, yet I could not suffer Colo. Walker (whose merits are too well known to you to need a recommendation of him from me, if any thing should cast up  
favorable to his wishes) to depart for New York, without giving your Excellency one more testimony of the obligations I consider myself under for the spirited, and able assistance, I have often derived from the State under your Administration.  
The scene is at last closed—I feel myself eased of a load of public care—I hope to spend the remainder of my days in cultivating the Affections of good Men, and in the practice of the domestic Virtues. permit me still to consider you in the number of my  
friends, and to wish you every felicity.   
Mrs Washington joins me in presenting the Compliments of the Season with our best respects to Mrs Clinton &amp; the family. I have the honor to be Dr Sir, With very sincere esteem &amp; affect. Yr Most obt &amp; obliged
