<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

DURING the wars which, for some time, have unhappily prevailed among the powers of Europe, the United States of America, firm in their principles of peace, have endeavoured by justice, by a regular discharge of all their national and social duties, and by  
						every friendly office their situation has admitted, to maintain, with all the belligerents, their accustomed relations of friendship, hospitality, and commercial intercourse. Taking no part in the questions which animate these powers against each other, nor permitting  
						themselves to entertain a wish but for the restoration of general peace, they have observed with good faith the neutrality they assumed, and they believe that no instance of a departure from its duties can be justly imputed to them by any nation. A free use of their harbours  
						and waters, the means of refitting, and of refreshment, of succour to their sick and suffering, have at all times, and on equal principles, been extended to all, and this too amidst a constant recurrence of acts of insubordination to the laws, of violence to the persons, and  
						of trespasses on the property of our citizens, committed by officers of one of the belligerent parties received among us. In truth, these abuses of the laws of hospitality have, with few exceptions, become habitual to the commanders of the British armed vessels hovering on  
						our coasts, and frequenting our harbours. They have been the subject of repeated representations to their government. Assurances have been given that proper orders should restrain them within the limit of the rights and of the respect due to a friendly nation: but those  
						orders and assurances have been without effect; no instance of punishment for past wrongs has taken place. At length a deed, transcending all we have hitherto seen or suffered, brings the public sensibility to a serious crisis, and our forbearance to a necessary pause.  
					A frigate of the United States, trusting to a state of peace, and leaving her harbour on a distant service, has been surprised and attacked by a British vessel of war of a superior force, one of a squadron then lying in our waters, and covering the  
						transaction, and has been disabled from service with the loss of a number of men killed and wounded. This enormity was not only without provocation, or justifiable cause, but was committed with the avowed purpose of taking by force, from a ship of war of the United States, a  
						part of her crew, and that no circumstance might be wanting to mark its character, it had been previously ascertained, that the seamen demanded, were native citizens of the United States. Having effected his purpose, he returned to anchor with his squadron within our  
						jurisdiction. Hospitality under such circumstances, ceases to be a duty; and a continuance of it with such uncontrouled abuses, would tend only by multiplying injuries and irritations to bring on a rupture between the two nations. This extreme resort is equally opposed to the  
						interests of both, as it is to assurances of the most friendly dispositions on the part of the British government, in the midst of which, this outrage has been committed. In this light, the subject cannot but present itself to that government, and strengthen the motives to an  
						honourable reparation of the wrong which has been done, and to that effectual controul of its naval commanders, which alone can justify the government of the United States in the exercise of those hospitalities it is now constrained to discontinue.  
					In consideration of these circumstances, and of the right of every nation to regulate its own police, to provide for its peace, and for the safety of its citizens, and consequently to refuse the admission of armed vessels into its harbours or waters, either  
						in such numbers or of such descriptions, as are inconsistent with these, or with the maintenance of the authority of the laws, I have thought proper, in pursuance of the authorities specially given by law, to issue this my Proclamation, hereby requiring all armed vessels  
						bearing commissions under the government of Great Britain, now within the harbours or waters of the United States, immediately, and without any delay, to depart from the same, and interdicting the entrance of all the said harbours and waters to the said armed vessels, and all  
						others bearing commissions under the authority of the British government.  
					And if the said vessels, or any of them, shall fail to depart as aforesaid, or if they or any others, so interdicted, shall hereafter enter the harbours or waters aforesaid, I do, in that case, forbid all intercourse with them, or any of them, their  
						officers or crews, and do prohibit all supplies and aid from being furnished to them, or any of them.  
					And I do declare, and make known, that if any person from, or within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, shall afford any aid to any such vessels contrary to the prohibition contained in this Proclamation, either in repairing any such vessel, or  
						in furnishing her, her officers, or crew, with supplies of any kind, or in any manner whatsoever, or if any pilot shall assist in navigating any of the said armed vessels, unless it be for the purpose of carrying them in the first instance beyond the limits and jurisdiction  
						of the United States, or unless it be in the case of a vessel forced by distress, or charged with public dispatches as hereafter provided for, such person or persons shall, on conviction, suffer all the pains and penalties by the laws provided for such offences.  
					And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing office civil or military, within or under the authority of the United States, and all others, citizens or inhabitants thereof, or being within the same, with vigilance and promptitude to exert their  
						respective authorities, and to be aiding and assisting to the carrying this Proclamation, and every part thereof, into full effect.  
					Provided, nevertheless, that if any such vessel shall be forced into the harbours or waters of the United States, by distress, by the dangers of the sea, or by the pursuit of an enemy, or shall enter them charged with dispatches or business from their  
						government, or shall be a public packet for the conveyance of letters and dispatches, the commanding officer immediately reporting his vessel to the collector of the district, stating the object or causes of entering the said harbours or waters, and conforming himself to the  
						regulations in that case prescribed under the authority of the laws, shall be allowed the benefit of such regulations respecting repairs, supplies, stay, intercourse and departure as shall be permitted under the same authority.  
					  
						  
							  
							In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States, to be affixed to these presents and signed the same.  
						  
						  
							(seal.)  
							Given at the city of Washington, the second day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seven, and of the sovereignty and independence of the United States, the thirty-first.  
						  
					  
  
					  
						TH: JEFFERSON.

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
A PROCLAMATION.  
DURING the wars which,  
  
for some time, have unhappily  
prevailed among the powers of  
Europe, the U. States of Ame-  
rica, firm in their principles of  
peace, have endeavored by jus-  
tice, by a regular discharge of all  
their national and social duties,  
and by every friendly office their  
situation has admitted, to main-  
tain with all the belligerents their  
accustomed relations of friend-  
ship, hospitality, and commer-  
cial intercourse. ‘Taking no part  
in the questions which animate  
these powers against each other,  
nor permitting themselves to en-  
tertain a wish but for the resto-  
ration of general peace, they have  
abserved with good faith the neu-  
trality they assumed, and they  
believe that no instance of a de-  
parture from its duties can be  
justly imputed to them by any  
nation. A free use of their har-  
bors and waters, the means of  
refitting and of refreshment, of  
succour to their sick and suffer-  
ing, have, at all times, and on  
equal principles, been extended  
to all, and this too amidst a con-  
stant recurrence of acts of insu-  
bordination to the laws, of vio-  
lence to the persons, and of tres-  
passes on the property of our ci-  
tuzens, committed by officers o  
f  
  
one of the belligerent parties re-  
ceived among us. In truth, these  
abuses of the laws of hospitality  
have, with few exceptions, be-  
come habitual to the commanders  
of the British armed vessels ho-  
vering on our coasts, and fre-  
quenting our harbors. They  
have been the subject of repeated  
representations to their govern-  
ment. Assurances have been  
given that proper orders should  
restrain them within the limit of  
the rights and of the respect due  
to a friendly nation: but those  
orders and assurances have been  
without effect; no instance of  
punishment for past wrongs has  
taken place. At length, a deed,  
transcending all we have hither-  
to seen or suffered, brings the  
public sensibility to a serious cri-  
sis, and our forbearance to a ne-  
cessary pause. A frigate of the  
United States trusting to a state  
of peace, and leaving her harbor  
on a distant service, has been  
surprised and attacked by a Bri-  
tish vessel of superior force, one  
of a squadron then lying in our  
waters and covering the transac-  
tion, and has been disabled from  
service, with the loss of a num-  
ber of men killed and wounded,  
—This enormity was not only  
without provocation or justifiable  
cause, but was committed with

the avowed purpose of taking by  
force, from a ship of war of the  
United States, a part of her  
crew, and that no circumstance  
might be wanting io mark its  
character, it had been previously  
ascertained that the seamen de-  
manded were native citizens of  
the United States. Having ef-  
fected his purpose, ie returned  
to anchor wiih his squadron with-  
in our jurisdiction. Hospitality  
under such circumstances ceases  
to be a duty ; and a continuance  
of it, with such uncontrolled  
abuses, would tend only by mul-  
tiplying injuries and irritations,  
to bring on a rupture between  
the two nations. This extreme  
resort is equally opposed to the  
interests of both, as it is to as-  
surances of the most friendly dis-  
positions on the part of the Bri-  
tish government, in the midst of  
which this outrage has been com-  
mitted. In this light the object  
cannot but present itself to that  
government, and strengthen the  
motives to an honorable repara-  
tion of the wrong which. has been  
done, and to that effectual con-  
trol of its naval commanders,  
which alone can justify the go-  
vernment of the United States in  
the exercise of those hospitalities  
it is now constrained to discon-  
tinue.  
  
In consideration of these cir-  
cumstances, and of the right of  
every nation to regulate its own  
police, to provide for its peace  
and for the safety of its citizens,  
and consequently to refuse the  
admission of armed vessels into  
tts harbors or waters, either in  
such numbers or of such descrip-  
tions, as are inconsistent with  
these, or with the maintenance of  
the authority of the laws, I have  
ihought proper, in pursuance of  
‘he authorities specially given by  
haw, to issue this my proclama-  
tion, hereby requiring all armed  
vessels bearing: commissions un-  
der the government of Great Bri-  
  
tain, now within the harboi&#x27;s or  
waters of the United States, im-  
mediately and -without any delay  
to depart from the same, and in-  
terdicting the entrance of all the  
said harbors and waters to the  
said armed vessels, and to all  
others bearing commissions un-  
der the authority of the British  
government.  
  
And if the said vessels, or any  
of them, shall fail to depart as  
aforesuid, or if they or any others,  
so interdicted, shall hereafter en-  
ter the harbors or waters afore-  
said, I doin that case forbid all  
intercourse with them or any of  
them, their officers and crews,  
and do prohibit all supplies and  
aid from being furnished to them  
or any of them.  
  
And I do declare and make  
known, that if any person from,  
or within the jurisdiction and li-  
mits of the United States, shall  
afford any aid to any such vessel,  
contrary to the prohibition con-  
tained in this proclamation, ei-  
ther in repairing any such vessel,  
or in furnishing her, her officers,  
or crew, with supplies of any  
kind, or in any manner whatso-  
ever, or if any pilots shall assist  
in navigating any of the said  
armed vessels, unless it be for  
the purpose of carrying them, in  
the first instance, beyond the li-  
mits and jurisdiction of the Unit-  
ed States, or unless it be in the  
case of a vessel forced by dis-  
tress, or charged-with public dis-  
patches as hercinafter provided  
for, such person or persons shall,  
on conviction, suffer all the pains  
and penalties by the laws provided  
for such offences.

quire all persons bearing office,  
civil or military, within or under

wrongs has taken place. At length, a de-i  
transcending all which we have hitherto sec  
or sufiexsd, brings the pubhek sensibility to a  
&#x27; -i &#x27; ■  
  
serious crisis, and-ouf forbearance to a n pressary  
pause. A frigate of the United States trusting to a  
state of peace, and leaving her harbour on a 2fs- &#x27;  
tant service, has been surprised and attacked by a  
British vessel of superiour force, one of a squadron  
then lying in our waters and covering the transac­  
tion, and has been disabled from service, with the  
■ass of a number of men k/lied and wounded. This  
enormity was not only without provocation or jus­  
tifiable cause, but was committed with the avowed  
purpose of taking by force, from* a ship of war of  
the United States, a part of her crew, and that no  
circumstance might be wanting to mark its charac­  
ter, it had been previously ascertained that the sea­  
men demanded were native citizens of the U. States.  
Having effected his purpose, he returned to anchor  
with his squadron within our jurisdiction. Hos­  
pitality under such circumstances ceases to he a du­  
ly : and a continuance of it, with such uncontrol­  
led abuses, would tend only by multiplying injuries  
and irritations, to bring on abrupture between the  
two nations. Thi3 extreme resort is equally op­  
posed to the interests of both, as it is to assurances  
of the most friendly dispositions on the part of the  
British government, in the midst of which this out­  
rage has been committed, in this light the subject  
cannot but present itself to that government, and  
strengthen the motives of an honourable reparation  
of the wrong winch has been done, and to that ef­  
Jcctual rontroul of its naval commanders, \\hich  
alone can justify the government of the United  
States in the exercise of those hospitalities it is  
now constrained to discontinue.  
  
m consideration 01 tiie^e circumstances and of  
the right of every nation to regulate its own pohre,  
to provide for its peare and for the safety of its citi­  
zens, and consequently to refuse the admission of  
armed vessels into our harbours or waters, either ia  
such numbers or of surh descriptions, as are incon­  
sistent with these, or with the maintenance of the  
authority of the laws, I have thought proper in pur­  
suance of the authorities specially given by law to  
issue this my PROCLAMATION, hereby requiring  
all armed vessels bearing commissions under thego­  
vernment of Great Britain, now within the har­  
bours or waters of the United States, immediately  
and without any delay to depart from the same, and  
interdicting the entrance of all the said harbours  
and waters to the said armed vessels, and to others  
hearing commissions under the authority of the  
British government.  
And if the said vessels, or Any of them, shall  
fail to depart as aforesaid, or if they or any others,  
so interdicted, shall hereafter enter the harbours  
or waters aforesaid, I do in that case forbid all in­  
tercourse with them or any of them, their officers  
or crews, and do prohibit all supplies and aid from  
being furnished to them or any of them.  
And I do declare and make known, that if any  
person from, or within the jurisdictional limits of  
the United States sh ill afford any aid to any such  
vessel, contrary to the prohibition contained in this  
Proclamation, either in repairing any such vessel,  
or furnishing her, her officers or crew, with sup­  
plies of any kind, or in any manner whatsoever, o*j.  
if any pilot shall assist in navigating any of the said  
armed vessels, unless it be for the purpose of carry­  
ing them in the first instance, beyond the limits  
and jurisdiction of the United States, or unless it be  
in the rase of a vcssrl lorred by distress, or charged  
with publirk despatches as hereinafter provided for,  
such person or persons shall, on conviction suffer  
all the pains and penalties by the laws provided ljr  
such offences.  
  
And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons  
bearing office civil or military within or under the  
authority of the United States, and all others, citi­  
zens or inhabitants thereof, or being within the  
same, with vigilance and promptitude to exert their  
respective authorities, and to be aiding and assist­  
ing to the carrying this Proclamation and every  
part thereof, into lull effect.  
Provided nevertheless, that if any such vessel  
shall be fjrccd into the harbours or waters of the  
United States by distress, by the dangers of the sea,  
or by the pursuit of an enemy, or shall enter them  
charged with dispatches or business from their go­  
vernment, or shall be a publick pack* for the con­  
veyance of letters and despatches, the commanding  
officer immediately reporting his vessel to the col­  
lector of the district, stating the object or cause*  
of entering the said harbours or waters, and con­  
forming himself to the-regulations in that case pre­  
scribed under the authority of the Jaws, shall be al­  
lowed the benefit of such regulations respecting re­  
pairs, supplies, stay, intercourse, and departure, as  
shall be permitted under the same authority.  
In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of  
the United States to be affixed to these presents, and  
signed the same.  
Given at the City Washington, the second day  
otJuly, in the year of our Lord one tliou­  
[Seal.] sand eight hundred and seven, and of the  
sovereignty and independence of the Unit­  
ed States the thirty-first.

DL&#x27;HING the wars which, for  
some time, have unhappily prevailed  
a rnonJth., powers of uropefhe  
U. S atesjof Amer ca, firm in their  
principles of peace, have endeavour  
ed by justice, by a regular discharge  
of all their national and social duties,  
and by every fnendly office their si­  
tuation has admitted, to maintain  
with all the belligerents, the accu  
tomcd relations of friendship, hospi­  
tality, and commercial intercourse.  
Taking no part in the questions  
which animate these powers againsr  
each other, nor permitting them  
selves to entertain a wish but for the  
restoration of general peace, tliery  
have observed with good taith ihe  
neutrality they assumed, and they  
believe that no instance of a depar­  
ture from its duties can be justly im­  
puted to them by any nation. A  
free use of their harbors and waters,  
the means of refitting and of refresh­  
ment, of succour to their sick and  
suffering, have, at all times, and on  
equal principles, been extended to  
all, and this oo amidst a constant  
recurrence of acts of insubordination  
to the laws, of violence to the pei­  
sonl, and of tresspasses on the pro­  
pel ty of our citizens, committed by  
bracers ot one ot Uie belligerent par  
lejs&#x27; received amotilus.&#x27; In truth  
uhese abuses of thejlivfs of hospitality  
have, with few exception, become  
habitual to the commanders of tht  
British armed vessels hovering on  
our coasts,&quot; and frequenting our har­  
bours. 4The have been the subject  
of repeated representations to their  
government. Assurance&amp;have been  
given that proper orderSbould res­  
train them within the limit of the  
rights and of the respect due to a  
friendly nation ; but those orders and  
assurances have been without effefctif  
no instance of punisrnent for past  
wrongs has taken place xt length,  
a deed, transcending all wc have hi­  
therto seen or suffered, brjnhs the  
public sensibility to a serious crisis,  
and our forbearance to a necessary  
pause A .frigate of the. Coiled  
States trusting to a state of peace, 8c  
leaving her harbour on a distant sen$  
vice, has been surprised and attacked  
by a British vessel of superior force,  
one of a squadron then lying in our  
waters and covering the transaction  
and has been disabled from service  
with the less of a number of men  
killed and wounded. This enormity  
r was not only without provocation or  
justifiable cause, bjut wasjcomrmtied  
with the avowed puiposeF .taking  
by force, . from a ship .ofjwar&#x27;of the

-~ DURING the wars which for foms

, ciples df pedee, “have endeavored by

- by.every friendly, office their situation.  
&#x27; has admitted, gaimaintain, with all  
the belligerents, their a(:_c‘u’f?ed re­  
lations of frien@ifhip, hofpitality,’ and  
commercial intefcourfe. Taking 1o  
part i the questions which annimatg -  
_ theféfﬁbw::ﬁégainﬂ&#x27;_ each otheér, nogr’  
permitting themdeives to eptertain a  
wish but for the restoration ‘of general  
‘pedce; they have observed with good:  
faith the &#x27;netztrdﬁf they assumed, and  
; they believe that po instance of a de­  
pafitare from its&#x27; duties can be&#x27;jullly

the belligereat parties received among  
wß+ kn t:ﬁf‘thefe abuses of-&#x27;th  
of hospitality have, with few ‘excep­  
tions, become habitual to the com­  
- manders of the Britith armed veflels  
. hovering on our coalts, and frequent­  
- ing our harbours. They have been  
i the fubjed of repeated representations  
. to their goverement.— A Turanceshave }  
| been givénvtharpr{)per.qrdeﬁ%ﬁ]&#x27;d ‘  
restrain them withinithe limit of the  
. rights and .of the ‘refpe® due to a  
f friendly nation 3 but those orders and  
- aflurances have been without effeét ;  
! no_ ioflance of punithment for past  
- wrongs has taken place. At length,  
a deed, transcending all we have hith­  
erto fcen or {uffered, brings the. pub­  
lic sensibility to a ferions. crisis, and  
‘our forbearance to a negeflury pause.  
- A frigate of the Uniied States truft­  
_ing to a Rate of peace, and leaving .  
her harbor on ‘a diltant service, has  
been surprised and attacked by a Bri:  
tith veflel, of superior force, one of a  
squadron then lying in our waters and  
covering the transaction, and has been  
- ddabled from service, with the loss of  
- a number of men killed and wounded.  
- This enormity was not only withont  
- provocation or juflifiable cause; but  
- was committed with the avowed pur­  
- pole of taking by force, fdom a flhip  
~of war of the United States, a part of  
her crew, asdithat noicircimttance  
mxghﬁntmg to mark its charac: ’  
ter, itthad been previously ascertained  
that the seamen demanded were na- |  
tive citizens of the United States.—. |  
Having effeted his purpose, he ré- s  
turnedy to anchor ‘with his squadron  
within our jurifdi&amp;ion. ﬁofpitaﬁty,  
under such circumstances ceases to be  
a duty ; and a continuance of it, with  
such uncontrolled abuses, wonld tend  
only by multiplying injuries and ifti­  
‘tations, to briog’on 4 rupture between  
the two nations. - This extreme resort |  
is equally -opposed to the interelts of f  
both, as it is to assurances of the most g  
friendly difpolitions on the part of the |  
Britith government, io the midlt of  
which this_outrage has beeh, cominit-&quot;

its duties can be justly imputed to them by  
any nation. A free ase of their harbors  
and waters, the means of refitting end re-  
freshment, of succour to their sick and suf-  
fering, have at all times, and on equal prin-  
ciples been extended to all, and this too a-  
midst a constant recurrence of acts of in-  
subordination to the laws, of violence to the  
persons, and of trespasses on the property  
of our citizens, committed by officers of  
one of the belligerent parties received a-  
mong us. In truth these abuses of the  
laws of hospitality have, with few excep-  
tions, become habitual to the commanders  
of British armed vessels hoveplig on our  
coasts, and frequenting our harbors, ‘Lhey

or some  
&#x27;ime, have unhappily prevailed among  
the powers of Europe, the United  
States of America, firm in their prin­  
ciples of peace, have endeavoured by  
justice, by a regular discharge of all  
their national and social duties, and by  
every friendly office their situation has  
admitted, to mantain, with all the belli­  
gerents, their accustomed relations of  
friendship, hospitality, and commercial  
intercourse. Taking no part in the  
questions which animate these powers  
against each ether, nor permitting  
themselves to entertain a wish but for  
the restoration of general peace, thev  
have observed with good faith the  
neutrality they assumed, upd they be­  
lieve that no instance of a departure  
from its duties can he jmrtlv imputed  
to them by any nation. A free use of  
their harbours and waters, the means  
of refitting and of refreshment, of sue- I  
cour to their sick and suffering, have,  
at all times and on equal principles, been  
extended to all, and this too amidst a con­  
stant recurrence of acts of insubordina­  
tion to the laws,of violence to the persons,  
and of trespasses on the property of our  
citizens, committed bv officers of one of  
  
thebe Higerent partiesreccivcd among us.  
In. truth these abuses of the laws cf hos­  
pitality have, with few exceptions, be­  
come habitual to the commanders of the  
British armed vessels hovering on our  
coasts, and frequenting our harbours.  
They have been the subject of repeated  
representations to their government.—  
Ass n ances have been given that proper  
orders should restrain them w ithin the  
limit ol the rights and of the respect due  
to a friendly nation; but those orders and  
assurances have been without effect; no  
instance of punishment for past wrongs  
lias taken place.  
At length, a deed, transcending all we  
have hitherto seen or stifle red, brings  
the publick sensibility to a crisis, and  
cur forbearance to a necessary pause.  
A frigate of the United States, trusting  
to a state of peace, and leaving her har­  
bor on a distant service, has been sur­  
prised and attacked by a British vessel  
of superior force, one of a squadron then  
h mg in our waters and covering the  
transaction, and has been disabled  
from service, with the loss of a number  
ot men killed and wounded. T his enor­  
mity was not only without provocation  
  
or justifiable cause, but was committed  
with the avowed purpose of taking by  
force, from a ship of war of the United  
States, a part of her crew; and that no  
circumstance might be wanting to mark  
its character, it had been previously as­  
certained that the seamen demanded  
were native citizensofthe UnitcdStatcs.  
Having effected his purpose, he returned  
to anchor with his squadron within our  
jurisdiction. Hospitality under such cir­  
cumstances ceases to he a duty, and a  
continuance of it, with such uncontrolled  
abuses, would tend only by multiplying  
injuries and irritations, to bring on a  
rupture between the two nations. This  
extreme resort is equally opposed to the  
interest oi both, as it is to assurances of  
the most friendly dispositions on the  
part cl the British government, in the  
midst of which this outrage has been  
committed. In this light the subject  
cannot but present itself to that govern­  
ment, and strengthen the motives to an i  
honourable reparation of the wrong  
whicli has been done, and to that effec­  
tual controul ol its naval commanders,  
which alone can justify the United  
States in the exercise of those hospitali­  
ties it is now constrained to discontinue*  
In consideration of these circumstances  
and the right of every nation to regulate  
  
its own police, to provide tor its peace  
and lor the safety of its citizen-, and  
consequently to refuse the admission cl&#x27;  
armed vessels into its harbours or wa­  
ters, either in such numbers, or of such  
descriptions, as arc inconsistent with  
these, or with the maintenance of the  
authority of the laws, I have thought  
proper, in pursu tr ee of the authorities  
specially given by law, to issue this my  
proclamation, In reby requiring all arm­  
ed vessels bearing commissions under  
the government of Great-Britain, now  
within the harbours or waters of the U­  
nited States, immediately and without  
any delay to depart from the same, and  
interdicting the entrance of all the said  
harbours and waters to the said armed  
vessel?, ahd to all others bearing com­  
missions under the authority of the Bri­  
tish government.  
And if the said vessels, or any of  
them, shall fail to depart as aforesaid, or  
if they, or any others so interdicted,  
shad hereafter enter the harbours and  
waters aforesaid, I do in that case for­  
bid all intercourse with them or any of  
them, their offic ersor crews, and do pro­  
hibit all supplies and aid from being  
furnished to them or any of them.  
  
And I do declare and make known,  
that if any person from, or within the  
jurisdictional limits of the U. States,  
shall afford any aid to any such vessel,  
contrary to the prohibition contained in  
this proclamation, either in repairing a­  
nv such vessel, or in furnishing her, her  
officers and crew, with supplies of any  
kind, or in any manner whatsoever; or  
if any pilot shall assist in navigating any  
of the said armed vessels* unless it be  
for the purpose of carrying them in the  
first instance beyond the limits and ju­  
risdiction of the United States, or unless  
it be in the case of a vessel forced by  
distress, or charged with public dis­  
patches, as hereinafter provided for ;  
such person or persons shall, on convic­  
tion, suffer all the pains and penalties by  
the laws provided for such offences.  
And I do hereby enjoin and require

At length, a deed, tranfcending all we

the ceremony of a Court mourning

FOREIGN EVENTS.  
America.  
  
A PROCLAMATION,  
By Tuomas Jerrenson, President of the  
United States.  
  
Washington City, July 1, 1807.  
  
During the wars which, for some time,  
have unhappily prevailed among the powers  
of Europe, the United S:ates of America,  
firm in their principles of peace, have en-  
deavoured by justice, by a regular discharge  
of all their national and social duties, and by  
every friendly office their situation has ad-  
  
[Aveusy  
  
mitted, to maintain, with all the bellige.  
rents, their accustomed relations of friend.  
ship, hospitality, and commercial inter.  
course. Taking no part in the questions  
which animate these powers against each  
other, nor permitting themselves to enter.  
tain a wish but for the general restoration  
of peace, they have observed, with good  
faith, the neutrality they assumed,, and  
they believe that no instance of a departure  
from its duties can be justly imputed to  
them by any nation. A free use of their  
harbours and wateis, the means of refitting  
and refreshment, of succour to their sick  
and suffering, have, at all times, and on  
equal principles, been extended to all; and  
this too amidst a constant recurrence to acts  
of insubordination to the laws, of violence  
to the persons, and of trespasses on the  
property of our citizens, committed by off-  
cers of one of the belligerent parties Te.  
ceived among us. In truth, these abnses  
of the laws of hospitality have, with few  
exceptions, become habitual to the com.  
manders of the British armed vessels hover.  
ing on our coasts, and frequenting our har.  
bours. They have been the subject of re.  
peated representations to their government,  
Assurances have been given that proper  
orders should restrain them within the limit  
of the rights and of the respect due to a  
friendly nation; but those orders and as-  
surances have been without effect, and no  
instance of punishment for past wrongs has  
taken place. At length, a deed, transcend.  
ing all we have hitherto seen, or suffered,  
brings the public sensibility to a serious  
crisis, and our forbearance to a necessary  
pause. A frigate of the United States,  
trusting to a state of peace, and le.ving her  
harbour on a distant service, has been sur-  
prised and attacked by a British vessel of  
superior force, one of a squadron then  
lying in our waters, and covering the trans-  
action, and has been disabled from service,  
with the loss of a number of men killed and  
wounded.  
  
This enormity was not only withaut pro-  
vocation or justifiable cause, but was com-  
mitted with the avowed purpose of taking  
by force, from a ship of war of the United  
States, a part of her crew; and, that no  
circumstance might be wanting to mark its  
character, it had been previously ascer-  
tained that the seamen demanded were na-  
tives of the United States. Having effected  
his purpose, he returned to anchor with his  
squadron within our jurisdiction. Hospi-  
tality under such circumstances. ceases to  
be a «duty; and a continuance of it, with  
such uncontroled abuses, would tend only,  
by multiplying injuries and irritations, to  
bring on a rupture between the two a-  
tions. This gxtreme resort is equally op-  
posed to the interests of both, as it is to

assurances of the most friendly dispositions  
on the part of the British government, in  
the midst of which this outrage has been  
committed. In this light the subject can-  
not but present itself to that government,  
and strengthen the motives to an honour-  
able reparation of the wrong which has  
ual control of  
its naval commanders, which alone can  
justify the government of the United States  
in the exercise of those hospitalities it is  
now constrained to discontinue.  
  
In consideration of these circumstances,

my Proclamation, hereby requiring all  
armed vessels bearing commissions under

And IJ do declare and make known, that  
if any person from, or within the jurisdic-

afford any aid to any such vessel, contrary  
to the prohibition contained in this Procla-  
nation, either in repairing any such vessel,  
orin furnishing her, her officers or crew,  
with supplies of any kind, or in any man-

Bnless it be for the purppse of carrying

or unless it be in the case of a vessel forced

ses to be a duty; and a continuance of it,  
with such uncontrouled abuses, would tend  
only, by multiplying injuries and irritations,  
to bring on a rupture between the two na-  
tions. This extreme resort is equally op-  
posed to the interests of both,:-as it isto as-  
surances of the most friendly dispositions on  
the part of the British government, in the  
midst of which this outrage has been com-  
mitted. In this light the subject cannot but  
present itself to that government, and  
strengthen the mofives to an honourable re-  
paration of the wrong which has been done,  
and to that effectual controul of its naval  
commanders, which alone can justify the  
government of the United States, in the ex-  
ercise of those hospitalities it is now con-  
strained to discontinue. —In consideration ot  
these circumstances, and of the right of  
every nation to regulate its own police, to  
provide for its peace, and for the safety of  
its citizens, and consequently to refuse the  
adinission of armed vessels into its harbours  
or waters, either in such numbers or of such  
G@°scriptions as are inconsistent with these, or  
with the maintenance of the authority of the  
laws, Ihave thought proper, in pursuance  
of the authorities specially given by law, to  
issue this my proclamation, hereby requiring  
all armed vessels bearing commission under  
the government of Great Britain, now withe  
in the waters or harbours of the United  
States, immediately and without any delay  
to depart from the same, and interdicting  
the entrance of all the said harbours and  
waters to the said armed vessels, and to all  
others bearing commissions under the autho-  
rityof the British government.—-—And if the  
said vessels, or any of them, shall fail to dee  
part as aforesaid, or if they, or any others, so  
interdieted, shall hereafter enter the harbours  
or waters aforesaid, I do, in that case, forbid  
all intercourse with them, or any of them,  
their officers or crews, and do prohibit all  
supplies and aid from being furnished to them  
or any of them —And ! dodeclare and make  
known, that if any person from, or within  
the jurisdictional limits of the United States,  
shall afford any aid to any such vessel, con-  
trary to the prohibition contained in this  
proclamation, either in repairing any such  
vessel, or in furnishing her, her officers, or  
crew, with supplies of any kind, or in any

(Signed) THOMAS TINGEY.  
Navwy:Yard, Washington, Feb. 9, 1807.  
  
Br THOMAS JEFFERSON,  
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  
  
A PROCLAMATION.  
  
DURING the wars which, forsome time, have unhappily prevailed  
among the powers of Europe, the United States of America, firm in their  
principles of peace, have endeavoured by justice, by a regular discharge of  
all their national and social duties, and by every friendly office their situation  
has admitted, to maintain with all the belligerents, their accustomed rela-  
tions of friendship, hospitality, and commercial intercourse. Taking no  
part in the anaes which animate these powers against each other, nor  
permitting themselves to entertain a wish but for the restoration of general  
peace, they have observed with good faith the neutrality they assumed, and  
they believe that no instance of a departure from its duties can be justly im-  
puted to them by any nation. A free use of their harbours and waters, the  
means of refitting and refreshment, of succour to their sick and suffering,  
have, at all times, and on equal principles, been extended to all, and this too  
amidst a constant recurrence of acts of insubordination to the laws, of vio-  
lence to the persons, and of trespasses on the property of our citizens, com-  
mitted by officers of one of the belligerent parties received among us. In  
truth these abuses of the laws of hospitality have, with few exceptions, be-  
come habitual to the commanders of the British armed vessels hovering on  
our coasts, and frequenting our harbours. They have been the subject of  
repeated representations to their government. Assurances have been given  
that proper orders should restrain them within the limit of the rights and  
of the respect due to a friendly nation ; but those orders and assurances  
have been without effect ; no instance of punishment for past wrongs has  
taken place. At length a deed, transcending all we have hitherto seen or  
suffered, brings the publick sensibility to a serious crisis, and our forbear-  
  
ance toamecessary pause. A frigate of the United States, trusting to 2

state of »peate, and leaving her. liarbour on a distant service, has been sur-  
  
prised and attacked by a British vessel of superiour force, one of a squadron -  
  
then lying in our waters and covering the transaction, and has been disabled  
from service, with the loss of a number of men, killed and wounded,  
  
This enormity was not only without. provocation or justvianye CANSes but  
was committed with the avowed purpose of taking by force, froma ship of  
war of the United States, a part of her crew; and that no circumstance  
might be wanting to mark its character, it had been previously ascertained  
that the seamen demanded were native citizens of the United States. Hav-  
ing effected his purpose, he returned to anchor with his squadron within  
our jurisdiction. Hospitality, under such circumstances, ceases to be a du-  
ty : and a continuance of it, with such uncontrolled abuses, would tend only,  
by multiplying injuries and irritations, to bring on a rupture between the  
two nations. This extreme resort is equally opposed to the interests of both,  
  
as it is to assurances of the most friendly dispositions on the part of the  
  
British government, in the midst of which this outrage has been committed.  
In this light the subject cannot but present itself to that government, and  
strengthen the motives to an honourable reparation of the wrong which has  
been done, and to that effectual control of its naval commanders, which alone  
can justify the government of the United States in the exercise of those hos-  
pitalities it is now constrained to discontinue.  
  
In consideration of these circumstances, and of the right of every nation  
to regulate its own police, to provide for its peace and for the safety of its  
citizens, and consequently to refuse the admission of armed vessels mto its  
harbours or waters, either in such numbers or of such descriptions. as are  
  
inconsistent with these, or with the maintenance of the authority of the laws, -  
  
I have thought proper in pursuance of the authorities specially given by law  
to issue this my PROCLAMATION, hereby requiring all armed vessels  
bearing commissions under the government of Great-Britain, now within  
the harbours or wate?®s of the United States, immediately and witheut an  
delay to depart from the same, and interdicting the entrance of all the said  
harbours and waters to the said armed vessels, and’ to all others bearing  
commissions under the authority of the British government.  
  
And if the said vessels, or any of them, shall fail to depart as aforesaid,  
  
or if they or any others, so interdicted, shall hereafter enter the harbours or  
waters aforesaid, I do in that case forbid all intercourse with them or any  
of them, their officers or crews, and do prohibit all supplies and aid from  
being furnished to them or any of them.  
  
And I do declare and make known, that if any person from, or within the  
jurisdictional limits of the United States shall afford any aid to any such ves-  
sel, contrary to the prohibition contained in the Proclamation, either in re-  
pairing any such vessel, or in furnishing her, her officers or crew, with sup-  
plies of any kind, or in any manner whatsoever, or if any pilot shall assist in  
navigating any of the said armed vessels, unless it be for the purpose of carry-  
ing them in the first instance beyond the limits and jurisdiction of the United  
States, or unless it be in the case of a vessel forced by distress, or charged  
with public dispatches as hereinafter provided for, such person or persons  
shall on conviction, suffer all the pains and penalties by the laws provided for  
such offences.  
  
_ And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing office civil or mil-  
itary within or under the authority of the United States, and all others, cit-  
izens or iphabitants thereof, or being within the same, with vigilance and  
promptitude to exert their respective authorities, and to be aiding and assis-

which regulates the relations of civi¬

provisions of the present decree shall  
be abrogated and null, in fact, as  
soon as the English abide again by  
the principles of the law of nations,  
which are also the principles of jus¬

No. 6 .—Proclamation the Preti“  
  
dent of the United ^ates.  
  
During the wars which, for some  
time, have unhappilyprevailedamong  
the |X)wers of Europe, the United  
States of America, firm in their prin¬  
ciples of peace, have endeavoured,  
by justice, by a regular discharge of  
all their national and social duties,  
and by every friendly office their si¬  
tuation has admitted, to maintain,  
with all the belligerents, their accus¬  
tomed relations of friendship, hospi¬  
tality, and commercial intercourse.  
Taking no part in the questions  
which animate these powers against  
each other, not permittingthemselves  
to entertain a wish but for the gene¬  
ral restoration of peace, they have  
observed, with go^ faith, the neu¬  
trality they assumed, and they be¬  
lieve that no instance of a departure  
from its duties can be justly imputed  
to them by any nation. A firro use  
of their harbours and waters, the  
means of refitting and refreshment,  
of succour to their sick and suffer¬  
ing, have, at all times, and on equal  
principles, been extended to all; and  
this too amidst a constant recurrence  
of acts of insubordination to the laws,  
of violence to the persons, and of  
trespasses on the property of oia:  
citizens, committed by officers of  
one of the belligerent parties received  
among us. In truth, these abuses of  
c  
  
XXXIV  
  
APPENDIX.  
  
the laws of hospitality have, with few  
exceptions, become habitual to the  
eommanders of the British armed  
vessels hovering on our coasts, and  
frequenting our harbours. They have  
been the subject of repeated repre¬  
sentations to their government. As¬  
surances have been given that pro¬  
per orders should restrain tliem with¬  
in the limit of the rights, and of the  
respect due to a friendly nation;  
but those orders and assurances have  
been without effect, and no instance  
of punishment for past wrongs has  
taken plac^. At length, a deed,  
transcending all we have hitherto  
seen, or suffered, brings the public  
sensibility to a serious crisis, and  
our forbearance to a necessary pause.  
A frigate of the United States, trust¬  
ing to a state of peace, and leaving  
her harbour on a distant service, has  
been surprised and attacked by a  
British vessel of superior force, one.  
of a squadron then lying in our waters,  
and covering the transaction, and  
has been dis^led from service, with  
the loss of a number of men killed  
and wounded.  
  
This enormity was not only with¬  
out provocation or justifiable cause,  
but was committed with the avowed  
purpose of taking, by force, from a  
ship of war of the United States, a  
part of her crew; and, that no cir¬  
cumstance might be wanting to mark  
its character, it had been previously  
ascertained that the seamen demand¬  
ed were natives of the United States.  
Having effected his puroose, he re¬  
turned to anchor with his squadron  
within our jurisdiction. Hospitality,  
under such circumstances, ceases to  
be a duty; and a continuance of it,  
with such uncontroulled abuses, would  
tend only, by multiplying injuries  
and irritations, to bring on a rupture  
between the twp nations. This  
  
extreme resort is equally opposed  
to the interests of both, as it is to  
assurances of the most friendly dis¬  
positions on the part of the Britisli  
government, in the midst of which  
this outrage has been committed.  
In tlris light, the subject cannot but  
present itself to that government,  
and strengthen the motives to an  
honourable reparation of the wrong  
which has been done, and to that  
effectual controul of its naval com¬  
manders, which alone can justify the  
government pf the United States in  
the exercise of those hospitalities it  
is now constrained to discontinue.  
  
In consideration of these circum¬  
stances, and of the right of every  
nation to regulate its own police, to  
provide for its peace, and for the  
safety of its citizens, and consequent¬  
ly to refuse the admission of ariPed  
vessels into its harbours or waters,  
either in such numbers or of such  
description, as are inconsistent with  
these, or with the maintenance of  
tlie authority of the laws, I have  
thought proper, in pursuance of the  
authorities specially given by law,  
to issue this my proclamation, here¬  
by requiring all armed vessels, bear¬  
ing commissions under the govern¬  
ment of Great Britain, now within  
the harbours or waters of the United  
States, immediately, apd without any  
delay, to depart from the same, and  
interdicting the entrance of all the  
said harbours and waters to the said  
armed vessels, and to all others bear¬  
ing commissions under the authority  
of the British government.  
  
And if the said vessels, or any of  
them, shall fail to depart as aforesaid,  
or if they, or any others, so inter¬  
dicted, shall hcreafler enter the har¬  
bours or waters aforesaid, I do in  
that case forhid all intercourse witli

And 1 do declare and make known,  
that if any person from, or within  
the jurisdictional limits of the United  
States, shall afford any aid to any such  
vessel, contrary to the prohibition  
contained in this proclamation, either  
in repairing any such vessel, or in  
furnisliing her, her officers or crew,  
with supplies of any kind, or in any  
manner whatsoever, or if any pilot  
shall assist in navigating any of the  
said armed vessels, unless it be for  
the purpose of carrying them, in tlie  
first instance, beyond the limits and  
jurisdiction of the United States,  
or unless it be in the case of a ves¬  
sel forced by distress, or cliarged  
with public dispatches, as hereinafter  
provided for, such person or persons  
shall, on conviction, suffer all the  
pains and penalties by the laws pro¬  
vided for in such offences.  
  
And I do hereby enjoin and re¬  
quire all persons bearing office, civil  
or military, within or under the  
authority of tlie United States, and  
all others, citizens or inhabitants  
thereof, with vigilance and prompti¬  
tude to exert their respective autho¬  
rities, and to be aiding and assisting

posed to the interest of both, as it is to as-

the part of the British government, in the

In this Jight the subject cannot but present  
itself to that government, and strengthen the  
motives to an honourable reparation for the  
wrong which has been done.” And it 1s  
now well known that such reparation might  
have been promptly obtained in London, had  
the president’s instractions to Mr. Monroe  
been compatible with such an adjustment.  
He was required not to negotiate on this sin-

was for ever settled) but in connection with  
another claim of long standing, and, to say  
  
the least, of doubtful right; to wit, the ex-

discharge of all their national and social duties, and

the restoration of general peace, they have observed  
with good faith the neutrality they assumed, and

A free use of their harbors and waters, the mezns

have, with few exceptions, become habitual to  
the commanders of the British armed vessels ho«

They have been the siibject of repeated representae

suffered, brints the public sensibility to a necessary  
crisis, and our forbearance to a necessary pause.  
A frigate of the United States, —o toa state  
~ of peace, and leaving her harbor oma distant ser-  
vice, has been surprised and attacked by a British  
~ vessel of superior force, one of asquadron then lying  
in our waters and cover ng the transac‘ion, and has  
been disabled from service, with the loss of a  
number of men killed and wounded. This enormity  
was not only without provocation or justifiable  
cause, but was comsnitted with the avowed purpose  
of taking by force, from a ship of war ofthe Uni-ed  
States, a part of her crew, and that no circumstance  
might be wanting to mark its character, it had been  
previonsly ascertained that the sexzmen demanded  
were native citizens of the United States. Having  
effected his purpose, he returned to an anchor with  
his squadron within our jurisdiction. Hospitality  
under such circumstances ceases to he a duty: and  
a continuance of it, with such uneentroiled abuses,  
would tend only by multiplying injuries and inrita-  
tions, to bring on a rupture hetween the two nations.  
The extreme resort is equally oppesed to the in-  
terests of both, as it is to assurances of the most  
friendly dispositions on the part of the Pritish .go-  
  
vernment, in the midst-of which the outrage has!  
  
been committed. In this light the subiect cannot  
but present itself to that government, xnd strengthen  
the motives to an honorable reparation of the wrong  
which has been done, and to that effectual control of  
its navalcommanders, which alone can justify the go-  
vernment of the United States in the exercise ofthose  
hospitalities it is now constrained to discontinue.  
  
In consideration of these circumstances and of  
the right of every nation to regulate its own police,  
to provide for its peace and for the safety of its ci-  
tizens, and consequently to refuse the admission of  
armed vessels into its harbors or waters, either in  
such nambers or of such descriptions, as are in-  
consistent with these, or with the maintenance of  
tne authority of the laws, I have thought proper in  
- pursuance ef the authorities specially given by law,  
te issue this my PROCLAMATION, hereby requir-  
ing all armed vessels bearing commissions under the  
  
mment of Great Britain, now within the har-  
bors or waters of the. United States, immediately  
and witheut any delay todepart from the same, and  
interdicting the entrance of all the said harbors and  
waters to the said armed vessels, and to all others  
bearing commissions under the authority of the  
British government.  
  
{nd if the said vessels, or any of them, shall  
fail to depart as aforesaid, or if they or any others,  
so indicted, shall hereafter enter the harbors or  
waters aforesaid, I do in that case forbid all inter-  
course with them or any of them, their officers or  
erews, and do prohibit all supplies and aids from  
being furnis!:ed to them or any of them,  
  
And I do declare and make known, that if any  
person from, er within the jurisdictional limits of  
the United States, shall afford any aid to any such  
vessei, contrary to the prohibition coutained in  
this Proclamation, either in repairing any such ves-  
se], or in furnishing her, her officers or crew, with  
supplies of any kind, or in any manner whatsoever,  
or if any pilot shall assist im navigating any of the  
said armed vessels, unless it he for the purpose of  
carrying them in the first instance, beyond the li-  
mits and jurisdiction of the United States, or unless  
it be in the case of a vessel forced by distress, or  
eharged with public dispatches as hereinafter pro-  
vided for, such person or persons shall, on convic-  
tion, «uffer all the pains and penalties by the laws  
  
: :  
  
And Ido ‘hereby enjoin and require all persons  
bearing office civil or military within or under the  
authority of the United States, and all others, citi-  
zens or inhabitants thereof, or being within the  
same, with vigilance and promptitude to exert their  
respective authorities, and to be aiding and assist-  
ing to the carrying this Proclamation and every  
part thereof, into full effect.  
  
Previded nevertheless, that if any such vessel  
shall be forced into the harbors or waters of the  
United States by distress, by the dangers of the sea,  
or by the pursuit of an enemy, or.shall enter them  
charged with dispatches or business from their go-  
vernment, or shall be a public packet for the con-  
vevance of letters and dispatches, the commanding  
officer immediately reporting his vessel to the col-  
lector of the district, stating the object or causes  
of entering the said harbors or waters, and con-  
forming himself to the regulations in that case pre-  
scribed under the authority of the laws, shall be  
allowed the benefit of such regulations respecting  
supplies, stay, intercourse and departure as shall  
be permitted under the same authority.  
  
In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal  
of the United States to be affixed to these presents  
and signed the same.  
  
Given at the city of Washington this second day  
of July in the year of our Lord one  
thousand eight hundred and seven, and  
of the Sovereignty and Independence  
of the United States, the thirty-first.
