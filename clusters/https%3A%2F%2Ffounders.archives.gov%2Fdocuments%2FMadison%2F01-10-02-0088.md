Charles Pinckney and Rutledge sought to give the states exclusive control of the time, place, and manner for holding elections.  
  
Mr Madison. The necessity of a Genl. Govt. supposes that the State Legislatures will sometimes fail or refuse to consult the common interest at the expence of their local conveniency or prejudices. The policy of referring the appointment of the House of Representatives to the people and not to the Legislatures of the States, supposes that the result will be somewhat influenced by the mode. This view of the question seems to decide that the Legislatures of the States ought not to have the uncontrouled right of regulating the times places &amp; manner of holding elections. These were words of great latitude. It was impossible to foresee all the abuses that might be made of the discretionary power. Whether the electors should vote by ballot or viva voce, should assemble at this place or that place; should be divided into districts or all meet at one place, shd. all vote for all the representatives; or all in a district vote for a number allotted to the district; these &amp; many other points would depend on the Legislatures, and might materially affect the appointments. Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed. Besides, the inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, would produce a like inequality in their representation in the Natl. Legislature, as it was presumable that the Counties having the power in the former case would secure it to themselves in the latter. What danger could there be in giving a controuling power to the Natl. Legislature? Of whom was it to consist? 1. of a Senate to be chosen by the State Legislatures. If the latter therefore could be trusted, their representatives could not be dangerous. 2. of Representatives elected by the same people who elect the State Legislatures; surely then if confidence is due to the latter, it must be due to the former. It seemed as improper in principle, though it might be less inconvenient in practice, to give to the State Legislatures this great authority over the election of Representatives of the people in the Genl. Legislature, as it would be to give to the latter a like power over the election of their Representatives in the State Legislatures.

circumstances of elections, leaving this business to  
the counties themselves.&quot;  
  
Mr Madison. &quot;The necessity of a General  
Government supenss that the State legislatures  
will sometimes fail or refuse to consult the common  
interest at the expense of their local conveniences or  
prejudices. The policy of referring the appointment  
of the House of Representatives to the people, and  
not to the Legislatures of the States, supposes that  
the result will be somewhat influenced by the mode.  
This view of the question seems to decide, that the  
Legislatures of the States ought not to have the  
uncontrolled right of regulating the times, places,  
and manner of holding elections.&quot;  
&quot;These were words of great latitude. It was im­  
possible to foresce all the abuses that might be made  
of the discretionary power. Whether the electors  
should vote by ballot, or vira voce; should assemble  
at this place or that place; should be divided into  
districts, or all meet at one place; should all vote for  
all the Representatives, or all in a district vote for  
a number allotted to the district; these and many  
other points would depend on the Legislatures, and  
might materially affect the appointments. When  
ever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure  
to carry, they would take care so to mould their re  
gulations as to favor the candidates they wished to  
succeed. Besides, the inequality of the representa  
tion in the Legislatures of particular States, would  
produce a like inequality in their representation in  
the National Legislature, as it was presumable that  
the counties having the power in the former case,  
would secure it to themselves in the latter. What  
danger would there be in giving a controlling pow­  
er to the National Legislature? Of whom was it  
to consist? First, of a Senate to be chosen by the  
State Legislatures. If the latter, therefore, could be  
trusted, their Representatives could not be danger­  
ous. Secondly, of Representatives elected by the  
same people who elect the State Legislatures.  
Surely, then, if confidence is due to the latter, it  
must be due to the former. It seemed as improper  
in principle, though it might be less inconvenient in  
practice to give to the State Legislatures this great  
authority over the election of the Representatives of  
the people in the General Legislature, as it would  
he to give to the latter a like power over the elec­

in the Constitution, James Madison, one of the leaders  
in framing the Constitution and in urging its adoption  
by the people sald: &quot;The necessity of a General  
Government supposes that the State Legislatures will  
sometimes fall or refuse to consult the common interest  
at the expense of their local conveniences or  
prejudice. The polley of referring the appointment  
of the House of Representatives to the people and not  
to the Legislatures of the States supposes that the re­  
sult will be somewhat influenced by the mode.  
This view of the question scems to decide that the  
Legislatures of the States ought not to have the tin­  
controlled right of regulating the times, places, and  
manner of holding elections. These were words of  
great latitude. It was impossible to foresce all the  
abuses that might be made of the discretionary power.  
Whether the electors should vote by ballot or viva  
voce; should assemble at this place or that place;  
should be divided into districts or all meet at one  
place; should all vote for all the Representatives or  
all in a district vote for a member allotted to the  
district-these and many other points would depend  
on the Legislatures, and might materially affect the  
appointments. Whenever the State Leglslatures had  
a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so  
to mold their regulations as to favor the candidates  
they wished to succeed. Besides, the inequality of  
the representation in the Legislatures of particular  
States would produce a like inequality in their  
representation in the National Legislature, as  
it was presumable that the counties having  
the power in the former case would secure it  
to themselves in the latter. What danger could there  
be in giving a controlling power to the National  
Legislature? of whom was it to consist? First, of  
a Senate to be chosen by the State Legislatures. if  
the latter, therefore, could be trusted, their repre­  
sentatives could not be dangerous. Seconlly, of  
Representatives elected by the same people who elect  
the State Legislatures, surely, then, if confidence is  
due to the latter, it mast be due a the former. It  
scemed as improper in principle, though it might be  
less inconvenient in practice, to sive to the State  
Legislatures this great authorlty over the election of  
the Representatives of the people in the General  
Legislature, as it would be to give the latter a like  
power over the election of their fepresentatives in the  
State Legislatures.
