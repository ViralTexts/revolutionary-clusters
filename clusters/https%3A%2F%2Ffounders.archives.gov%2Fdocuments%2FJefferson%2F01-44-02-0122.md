I think, as 1796. I was told in Philadelphia that Callendar, the author of the Political progress of Britain, was in that city, a fugitive from prosecution for having written that book, and in distress.

I knew myself incapable of that base warfare, &amp; believed him to be so. on the contrary, whatever I may have thought of the acts of the administration of that day, I have ever borne testimony to mr Adams’s personal worth, nor was it ever impeached in my presence without a just vindication of it on my part. I never supposed that any person who knew either of us could believe that either meddled in that dirty work.   but another fact is that I ‘liberated a wretch who was suffering for a libel against mr Adams.’ I do not know who was the particular wretch alluded to: but I discharged every person under punishment or prosecution under the Sedition law, because I considered &amp; now consider that law to be a nullity as absolute and as palpable as if Congress had ordered us to fall down and worship a golden image; and that it was as much my duty to arrest it’s execution in every stage, as it would have been to have rescued from the fiery furnace those who should have been cast into it for refusing to worship their image. it was accordingly done in every instance, without asking what the offenders had done, or against whom they had offended, but whether the pains they were suffering were inflicted under the pretended Sedition law.

## The National Intelligencer, of Tuesday last, contains an article from the "Utica Observer," in relation to the Georgia question, on which the writer suggests, that the Executive of the United States, as a co-ordinate branch of the Government, when called on to act, has the same right to decide on the constitutionality of a law, as the Judiciary, and that both, are equally in dependent in the sphere of action assigned them by the Constitution!
