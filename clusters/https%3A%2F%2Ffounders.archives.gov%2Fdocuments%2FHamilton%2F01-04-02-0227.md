riety in that union. Though several writers on the subject of government place that power in the class of executive authorities, yet this is evidently an arbitrary disposition: For if we attend carefully to its operation, it will be found to partake more of the legislative than of the executive character, though it does not seem strictly to fall within the definition of either of them. The essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws, or in other words to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society, while the execution of the laws and the employment of the common strength, either for this purpose or for the common defence, seem to comprise all the functions of the executive magistrate. The power of making treaties is plainly neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the execution of the subsisting laws, nor to the enaction of new ones, and still less to an exertion of the common strength. Its objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations, which have the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sovereign and sovereign. The power in question seems therefore to form a distinct department, and to belong properly neither to the legislative nor to the executive. The qualities elsewhere detailed, as indispensable in the management of foreign negotiations, point out the executive as the most fit agent in those transactions; while the vast importance of the trust, and the operation of treaties as laws, plead strongly for the participation of the whole or a part of the legislative body in the

The history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world to the sole disposal of a magistrate, created and circumstanced, as would be a president of the United States.  
To have entrusted the power of making treaties to the senate alone, would have been to relinquish the benefits of the constitutional agency of the president, in the conduct of foreign negotiations. It is true, that the senate would in that case have the option of employing him in this capacity; but they would also have the option of letting it alone; and pique or cabal might induce the latter rather tha

322:  
&quot;The essence of the Logislative is to enact laws; or, in  
other words, to prescribe rules for the regulation of the so.  
ciety; while the execution of the laws and employment of  
the common strength, either for this purpose or for the com  
mon defence, seem to comprise all the functions of the Ex.  
ecutive magistrate. The power of making treaties is plain.  
ly neither the one nor the other. It relates neither to the  
execution of the subsisting laws, nor to the enaction of new  
ones, and still less to an exertion of the common strength.  
Its objects are contracts with foreign Powers, which have  
the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good  
faith. They are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the  
subject, but agreements between sovereign and sovereign.  
The power in question, therefore, seems to form a distinct  
dopartment, and to belong properly neither to the Legislative  
nor to the Executive.&quot;  
Now, with the lights derived from this authoritative de.  
finition of treaties and the treaty-making power, Mr. R.

has not in the least extended the obligation of treaties. They are just  
as binding, and just as far beyond the lawful reach of legislative acts  
now, as they will be at any future period, or under any form of govern-  
ment.”  
  
And, in the 75th number of the Federalist, Alexander Hamilton, in  
commenting upon the power of making treaties, vested by our constitu-  
tion in the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate,  
after defining legislative and executive power, said:  
  
“‘ The power of making treaties is plainly neither the one nor the other.  
It relates neither to the execution of the subsisting laws, nor to the enac-  
tion of new ones, and still less to an exertion of the common strength.  
Its objects are CONTRACTS with foreign nations, which have the force of  
law, but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules  
prescribed by the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sov-  
ereign and sovereign. ‘The power in question seems therefore to form a  
distinct department, and to belong properly neither to the legislative nor  
to the exective.”
