December the 12th 1796  
To the President of the United States.  
  
We thank you, Sir, for your faithful and detailed exposure of the existing situation of our Country; and we sincerely join in sentiments of gratitude to an overruling providence, for the distinguished share of public prosperity, and private happiness, which the People of the United States so peculiarly enjoy.  
We are fully sensible of the advantages that have resulted from the adoption of measures (which you have successfully carried into effect) to preserve peace, cultivate friendship, and promote civilization, amongst the Indian Tribes, on the Western frontiers; Feelings of humanity, and the most solid political interests, equally encourage the continuance of this System.  
We observe with pleasure, that the delivery of the Military Posts, lately occupied by the British forces, within the territory of the United States, was made with cordiality, and promptitude, as soon as circumstances would admit; and that the other provisions of our Treaties with Great Britain and Spain, that were objects of eventual arrangement, are about being carried into effect, with entire harmony and good faith.  
The unfortunate, but unavoidable difficulties, that opposed a timely compliance with the terms of the Algerine Treaty, are much to be lamented; as they may occasion a temporary suspension of the advantages to be derived, from a solid peace with that Power, and a perfect security from its predatory warfare; at the same time, the lively impresssions that affected the Public mind, on the redemption of our Captive fellow Citizens, afford the most laudable incentive to our exertions, to remove the remaining obstacles.  
We perfectly coincide with you in opinion, that the importance of our Commerce demands a Naval force for its protection against foreign insult and depredation, and our solicitude to attain that object will be always proportionate to its magnitude.  
  
The necessity of accelerating the establishment of certain useful Manufactures, by the intervention of Legislative aid and protection, and the encouragement due to Agriculture, by the creation of Boards, (composed of intelligent individuals,) to patronize this primary pursuit of society, are subjects, which will readily engage our most serious attention.  
A National University may be converted to the most useful purposes; the science of Legislation, being so essentially dependent on the endowments of the mind, the public interests must receive effectual aid from the general diffusion of knowledge; and the United States will assume a more dignified Station, among the Nations of the Earth, by the successful cultivation of the higher branches of Literature.  
A Military Academy may be likewise rendered equally important; to aid and direct the physical force of the Nation, by cherishing a Military spirit, enforcing a proper sense of discipline, and inculcating a scientific system of tactics, is consonant to the soundest maxims of public policy; Connected with, and supported by such an establishment, a well regulated Militia, constituting the natural defence of the Country, would prove the most effectual, as well economical, preservative of peace.  
We cannot but consider with serious apprehensions, the inadequate compensations of the public Officers, especially of those in the more important Stations; it is not only a violation of the spirit of a public contract; but is an evil so extensive in its operation, and so destructive in its consequences, that we trust it will receive the most pointed Legislative attention.  
We sincerely lament, that whilst the conduct of the United States has been uniformly impressed with the character of equity, moderation, and love of peace, in the maintenance of all their foreign relationships; our trade should be so harrassed by the Cruizers and Agents of the Republic of France, throughout the extensive departments of the West Indies.  
Whilst we are confident, that no cause of complaint exists, that could authorize an interruption of our tranquillity, or disengage that Republic from the bonds of Amity, cemented by the faith of Treaties, we cannot but express our deepest regrets, that official communications have been made to you, indicating a more serious disturbance of our commerce; although we cherish the expectation that a sense of justice and a consideration of  
  
our mutual interests, will moderate their councils; We are not unmindful of the situation, in which events may place us, nor unprepared to adopt that system of conduct, which, compatible with the dignity of a respectable Nation, necessity may compel us to pursue.  
We cordially acquiesce in the reflection, that the United States, under the operation of the Federal Government, have experienced a most rapid aggrandizement and prosperity, as well political, as commercial.  
Whilst contemplating the causes that produce this auspicious result, we must acknowlege the excellence of the constitutional system, and the wisdom of the legislative provisions; but we should be deficient in gratitude and justice, did we not attribute a great portion of these advantages, to the virtue, firmness, and talents of Your Administration; which have been conspicuously displayed, in the most trying times, and on the most critical occasions. It is therefore, with the sincerest regrets, that we now receive an Official notification of Your intentions to retire from the public employments of Your Country.  
When we review the various scenes of your public life, so long and so successfully devoted to the most arduous services, civil and Military; as well, during the struggles of the American Revolution, as the convulsive periods of a recent date, we cannot look forward to Your retirement, without our warmest affections and most anxious regards accompanying You; and without mingling with our fellow Citizens at large, in the sincerest wishes for Your personal happiness, that sensibility and attachment can express.  
The most effectual consolation that can offer for the loss we are about to sustain, arises from the animating reflection, that the influence of Your example will extend to Your successors, and the United States thus continue to enjoy, an able, upright, and energetic administration.

tire harmony and good faith.  
  
The unfortunate, but unavoidable difficulties that op-  
pofed a timely compliance with the terms of the Algerine  
treaty, are much to be lamented ; as they may occafion a  
temporary fufpenfion of the advantages to be derived  
from a folid peace with that power, and a perfect fecurity  
from its predatory warfare ; at the fame time, the lively  
impreflions that affected the public mind, on the redemp-  
tion of our captive fellow-citizens, afford the moft laudable  
incentive to our exertions, to remove the remaining obfta-  
cles.  
  
We perfectly coincide with you in opinion that the im-  
portance of our commerce demands a naval force for its  
protection againtt foreign infult and depredation, and our  
folicitude to attain that object will be always proportionate  
toits magnitude.  
  
The neceflity of accelerating the eftablifhment of cer-  
tain ufeful manufactures, by the intervention of legiflative  
aid and protection, and the encouragement due to agricul-  
ture, by thecreation of Boards, (compofed of intelligent  
individuals) to patronize this primary purfuit of fociety,  
are fubjects which will readily engage our moft ferious at-  
tention.  
  
A national univerfiry may be converted to the moft  
ufeful purpofes--the fcience of legiflation, being fo eflenti-  
ally dependent on the endowments of the mind, the public  
intereft mutt receive effectual aid from the general diffufion  
of knowledge; and the United States will alflume a more  
digmified {tation, among the nations of the earth, by the  
fuccefsful cultivation of the higher branches of literature.  
  
A military academy may be likewife rendered equally  
important. ‘To aid and direct the phyfical force of the na-  
tion, by cherithing a military {pirit, enforcing a proper  
fenfe of difcipline, and inculcating a 1 fcientific fyitem of  
tactics, is confonant to the foundeft maxims of public poli-

ment, a well regulated militia, conftituting the national  
defence of the country, would prove the moft effectual, as  
well as economical, prefervative of peace.  
  
  
  
We cannot but confider, with ferious apprehenfions,  
the inadequate compenfations of public officers, efpecially  
of thofein the more important ftations. It is not only a  
violation of the {pirit of a public contract, but is an evil fo  
extenfive in its operation, and fo deftructive in its confe-  
quences, that we truft it will receive the moft pointed le-  
giflative attention.  
  
We fincerely lament, that whilft the condu&amp; of the  
United States has been uniformly imprefled with the cha-  
racter of equity, moderation, and love of peace, in the  
maintainance of all their foreign relstionthips, our trade  
fhould ve fo harrafled by the cruifers and agents of the  
republic of France, throughout the extenfive departments  
of theWe -Indies.  
  
Whilft we are confident that no caufe of complaint ex-  
ifts, that could authorife an interruption of our tranquilli-  
ty, or difengage that republic from the bonds of amity,  
cemented by the faith of treaties, we cannot but exprefs  
our deepeft regrets, that official communications have  
been made to you, indicating a more ferious difturbance of  
our commerce. Although we cherifh the expectation, that  
a fenfe of juftice, and a confideration of our mutual inte-  
refts will moderate their councils; we are not unmindful  
of the fituation in which events may place us, nor unpre-  
pared to adopt that fyftem of conduct, which, compatible  
with the dignity of a refpectable nation, neceflity may com-  
pel us to purfue.  
  
We cordially acquiefce in the reflection, that the Uni-  
ted States, under the operation of the federal govern-  
ment, have experienced a moft rapid aggrandizement and  
profperity, as well political, as commercial.  
  
Whilft contemplating the caufes that produce this auf-  
picious refult, we much acknowledge the excellence of the  
conftitutional fyftem, and the wifdom of the legiflative

the moft trying times, and on the moft critical occafions.  
It is, therefore, with the fincereft regret, that we now

from the public employments of your country-  
  
When we review the various fcenes of your public life,

‘We are fully sensible of the advan­  
tages that have resulted from the a­  
doption of measures (which you have  
fuccefsfully carried into effet) to pre­  
serve peace, cultivate friendfhip, and

our treaties with Great Britain and  
Spain, that were obje&amp;s of eventual  
arrangement, are about being carried  
into effe&amp;, with intire harmony and  
good faith.  
The unfortunate, but unavoidable  
difficulties that opposed a timely  
compliance with the terms of the Al­  
getine treaty were much tobe lament­  
ed ; as they may occaficn a tempo­  
rary suspension of the advantages to  
be derived, from a solid peace widh  
that power, and a perfe&amp; security  
from its predatory warfare : at the  
fame time, the lively impressions that  
affe@ed the public mind on the re­

of intelligent individvals) to patro­  
nife this primary pursuit of society,  
are fubjeéts which will readily engage  
our moit serious attention.  
  
A national university may be con­  
verted to the most ufeful purposes—  
The sciences of legislation, being so  
essentially dependant on the endow­  
ments of the mind, the public interest  
must receive effe¢tual aid from the  
general diffufion of knowledge ; and  
the United States will aflumea more

A military academy may be like­

conne&amp;ted with,and supported by such  
an eftablithment, a well regulated  
militia, constituting the national de­  
fence of the country, would prove  
the most effe&amp;tual, as well as econo­  
mical preservative of peace. | \
‘We cannot but confider, with se­  
rious apprehensions, the inadequate  
compensations of the public officers,  
especially of those in the more im­  
portant stations. It is not only a  
violation of the spirit of a public con­  
du&amp;, but fs an evil so extensive in  
its operation, and so deftrutive inits  
consequences, that we trust it will  
receivé the most pointed legislative  
attention. ; :  
We sincerely lament, that whilst  
the condu&amp; of the United States has  
been uniformly imprefled with the  
chara&amp;ter of equity, moderation, and  
love of peace, in the maintenance of  
all their foreign relationships, our  
trade should be so harrafied by the  
croifers and agents of the Republic  
of France, throughout the extenﬁ‘ve/  
department of the Weft-Indies. &#x27;  
Whilst we are confident that no  
cause of complaint exists, that could  
authorife an iniercuption of our tran.  
quility, or disengage that Republic  
from the bonds of amity, ceménted  
by the faith of treaties, we cannot  
but exprels our deepell regréts, that  
  
official communications havé been  
made to you indicating a -more feri- |  
ous difturbanee of our commerce.  
Although we cherish the expetation,  
that a sense of justice, and a consi­  
deration of our mutugl interests will  
moderate their councils ; we are not  
unmindful of the situation in which  
events may place us, nor unprepared  
to adopt that system of conduét, which  
compatible with the dignity of a re­  
fpe&amp;table nation, neceflity may com­  
pel us to pursue.  
We cordially acquiesce in the re­  
fle&amp;tion, that the United States, under  
the operation of the federal %overn­  
ment, have experienced a most rapid  
aggrandizement and prosperity, as  
well political, as commercial. ,  
Whillt contemplating the causes  
that produce this auspicious result,  
we must acknowledge the excellence  
of the constitutional {yftem, and the  
wisdom of the legislative provisions ;  
but we should be deficient in gratitude  
and justice, did we not attribute a  
great portion of these advantages, to  
the virtue, firmnefs and talents ot  
your administration ; which have  
been conspicuously displayed in the  
most trying times, and on the most  
critical occasions. It is, &#x27;therefore,  
with the sincerest regret, that we now  
receive an official notification of your  
intentions to retire from the public  
employments of your country.  
  
When we review the various scenes  
of your public life, so long and so  
fuccefsfully, devoted to the most ar­  
duous services, civil and military=—as  
well during the struggles of the Ame­

most anxious regard accompanying

fellow citizens at large, the sincerest  
wishes for your personal happiness,

express.  
The most effe@ual consolation that  
can coffer for the loss we are about to  
sustain, arises from the animating re­  
fle@tion, that the influence of your

THE ANSWER OF THE SENATE.  
WE thank you, Sir, for your faithful and detailed expoſure of the  
  
exiſting ſituation of our country; and we fincerely join in ſentiments  
of gratitude to an over-ruling Providence, for the diſtinguiſhed ſhare  
of public proſperity and private happineſs which the people of the  
United States ſo peculiarly enjoy.  
  
We are fully ſenſible of the advantages that have reſulted from  
the adoption of meaſures (which you have ſucceſsfully carried into  
effect) to preſerve peace, cultivate friendſhip, and promote civiliza-  
tion, among the Indian tribes on the weſtera frontiers. Feelings of  
humanity, and the moſt ſolid political principles, equally encourage  
the continuance of this ſyſtem,  
  
We obſerve with pleaſure, that the delivery of the military poſts,  
lately occupied by the Britiſh forces, within the territory of the  
United States, was made with cordiality and promptitude, as ſoon as  
circumſtances would admit; and that the other proviſions of our  
treaties with Great Britain and Spain, that were objects of eventual  
arrangement, are about being carried into effect, with entire harmony  
and good faith.  
  
The unfortunate but unavoidable difficulties that oppoſed a timely  
compliance with the terms of the Algerine treaty, are much to be la-  
mented, as they may occaſion a temporary ſuſpenſion of the advantages  
to be derived from a ſolid peace with that power, and a perfe ct ſecu-  
rity from its predatory warfare ; at the ſame time, the lively impreſ-  
  
ſions that affected the public mind on the redemption of our captive

fellow-citizens, afford the moſt laudable incentive to our exertions to  
remove the remaining obſtacles.  
  
We perfectly coincide with you in opinion, That the importance of  
our commerce demands a naval force for its protection againſt foreign  
inſult and depredation; and our ſolicitude to attain that object will  
be always proportionate to its magnitude,  
  
The neceſſity of accelerating the eſtabliſhment of certaia uſeful  
manufactures, by the intervention of legiſlative aid and protection,  
and the encouragement due to agriculture, by the creation of Boards  
(compoſed of intelligent individuals) to patronize this primary pur-  
ſait of ſociety, are ſubjects which will readily engage our moſt ſerious  
attention.  
  
A national univerſity may be converted to the moſt uſeful pur-  
poſes : the ſcience of legiſlation being ſo eſſentially dependent on the  
endowments of the mind, the public intereſt muſt receive eſſectual aid  
from the general diffuſion of knowledge; and the United States will  
aſſume a more dignified ſtation among the nations of the earth, by the  
ſucceſsful cultivation of the higher branches of literature.  
  
A military academy may be likewiſe rendered equally important.  
To aid and direct the phyſical force of the nation, by checiſhing a  
military ſpirit, enforcing a proper ſenſe of diſcipline, and inculcating  
a ſcientific ſyſtem of tactics, is conſonant to the ſoundeſt maxims of  
Public policy. Connected with and ſupported by ſuch an eftabliſh-  
ment, a well regulated militia, conſtituting the national defence of  
the country, would prove the moſt effectual, as well as the œco-  
nomical preſervative of peace.  
  
We cannot but conſider, with ſerious apprehenſions, the inade-  
  
  
important ſtations. It is not only a violation of the ſpirit of a public  
contract, but is an evil ſo extenſive in its operation, and fo deſtrue-  
tive in its conſequences, that we truſt it will receive the molt pointed  
legiſlative attention.  
  
We ſincerely lament that, whilſt the conduct of the United States  
has been uniformly impreſſed with the character of equity, modera-  
tion, and love of peace, in the maintenance of all their foreign rela-  
tionſhips, our trade ſhould be fo harraſſed by the cruizers and agents  
  
of the republic of France, throughout the extenſive departments of  
the Weſt Indies.  
  
Whilſt we are confident that no cauſe of complaint exiſts that  
could authorize an interruption of our tranquillity, or diſengage that  
republic frem the bonds of amity, cemented by the faith of treaties,  
we cannot but expreſs our deepeſt regret, that official communica»  
tions have been made to you, indicating a more ſerious diſturbance of  
our commerce. Although we cheriſh the expeCtation that a ſenſe of  
juſtice and a conſideration of our mutual intereſts, will moderate their  
  
1  
  
councils, we are not unmindful of the ſituation in which events ma  
place us, nor unprepared to adopt that ſyſtem of conduct which, com-  
patible with the dignity of a reſpectable nation, neceſſity may com-  
pel us to purſue.  
  
We cordially acquieſce in the reflection, that the United States,  
under the operation of the federal government, have experienced a  
moſt rapid aggrandizement and preſperity, as well political as com-  
mercial.  
  
Whilſt contemplating the cauſes that produce this auſpicious re-  
  
  
tem, and the wiſdom of the legiſlative proviſions;—but we ſhould  
be deficient in gratitude and juſtice, did we not attribute a great por-  
tion of theſe advantages to the virtue, firmneſs, and talents of your  
adminiſtration ; which have been conſpicuouſly diſplayed in the moſt  
trying times, and on the moſt critical occaſions, It is, therefore,  
with the ſincereſt regret that we now receive an official notification  
of your intentions to retire from the public employments of your  
country. |  
  
When we review the various ſcenes of your public life, ſo long  
and ſo ſucceſsfully devoted to the moſt arduous ſervices, civil and  
military, — as well during the ſtruggles of the American revolution  
as the convulſive periods of a recent date, we cannot look forward to  
your retirement without our warmeſt affections and moſt anxious  
regards accompanving you ; and without —— with our fellow-  
citizens at large, due ſincereſt wiſhes for your perlonal happineſs that  
ſenſibility and attachment can expreſs,  
  
  
about to ſuſtain, ariſes from the animating reflection, that the influ-  
ence of your example will extend to your ſucceſſors ;&#x27;and the United  
States thus continue to enjoy, an able, upright, and energetic ad-  
miniſtration. |

Providence for the diftinguithed  
fhare of public profperity and  
private happinefs, which the peo-  
ple of the United States fo pecu-  
liarly enjoy.  
  
Weare fully fenfible oF the ad-  
vantages that have refulted ftom  
the adoption of meafures (which  
you have fuccefsfully carried into  
effect) to preferve peace, cultivate  
friendfhip and promote civiliza-  
tion amongit the Indian tribes, on  
the weftern frontiers; feelings of  
humanity, and the moft folid po-  
liticalinterefts, equatly encourage  
the continuance of this fyftem.  
  
We obferve with pleafure, that  
the delivery of the military polis,  
lately occupied by the Britith for-  
ces, within the territory of the  
United States, was made with  
cordiality and promptitude, as  
foon as circumftances would ad-

of our treaties with Great Britain  
and Spain, that were objects of  
eventual afrangement, are about  
being carried into effet, with en-  
  
Gees  
  
-  
  
fire harmony and good faith.  
  
The unfortunate, but unavcid-  
able difficulties, that oppofed a  
timely comipliance with the terms  
of the Algerine treaty, are much  
t be lamented : as they may occas |  
  
  
  
  
  
Gon a temporary fafpenfion of the  
advantages to be derived from a  
fotid peace with that power, and  
a perfect fectirity from its preda-  
tory warfare ; at the fame time,  
the livel? impreffions that affected  
the public mind, on the red¢mp-  
tion of our captive fellow citizerts,  
afforded the moft laudable incen-  
tive to our exertions, to remove  
the remaining obftacles.  
  
We perfedtly coincide with you  
in opinion, that the importance of  
our commerce betiihighe a navat  
force for its protection againft fo-  
reign infult and depredation, and  
our folicitude to attain that obje  
will be always proportionate to its  
magnitude.  
  
The neceffity of accelerating  
the eftablifhment of certain ufe-  
ful manufactures, by the interven-  
tion of legiflative aid and protec-  
tion, and the encouragement dus  
td agriculture, by the creation of  
boards, (compofed of intelligent

mary purfuit of fociety, are fub«

likewife rendered equally import-  
ant. ‘Lo aid and direct the phyfi-  
cal force of the nation, by che-  
riihing a military {pirit, enforcing  
2 proper fenfe of difcipline, and  
inculcating a ferentific fyftem of  
tactics, is confonant to the found-  
e{t maxims of public policy; con-  
nected with, and fupported by  
fuch an eftablifhment, a weil re-  
gulated militia, conftituting the  
natura] defence of the country,  
would prove the moft effectual,  
ag well asceconomical, preierva-  
tive of peace.  
  
‘We cannot but confider, with  
ferious apprehenfions, the inade-  
quate compenfations of the public  
officers, efpecially of thofe inthe  
more important ftations. It is  
not only a violation of the fpirit  
of a public contract, but is an  
evil fo extenfive in its operation,  
fo deftructive in is confequences,  
that we truft it will receive the  
moft pointed legiflative attention.  
  
We fincerely lament, that,  
whilit the condu&amp; of the United

ed with the charaGer of equity,

in the maintenance of all their

fhould be fo harrafled by the cruif-  
ers and agents of the republic of  
  
France, throughout the extenfive  
  
departments of the Weift-Indies.  
  
Whilft we are confident that  
nocaufe of complaint exifts that

our tranquility, or difengage that

deepeft regrets, that official com&lt;»  
  
munications have been _made to

turbance of our commerce. Al-  
though we cherifh the expecta-  
tion, that afenfe of juftice anda  
confideration of ovr mutual mter-  
efts will moderate their councils,  
  
we are not unmiundful of the fitu- -

We cordially acquiefce in the  
reficction, that the United States,  
under the operation of the feder-  
al government, have experienced  
a molt rapid aggrandifement and

Whilft contemplating the caufes  
  
that produce this aufpicious refult,  
  
we muft acknowledge the excel-  
lence of the conftitutional fyftem,  
and the wifdom of the legiilative

WE thank you, fir, for your faith-  
ful and detailed expofure of the exit-  
ing fituation of our country ; and we  
fincereJy join in fentiments of grati-  
tude to an overruling providence, for  
the diltinguiflied lhare of public prof-  
perity, and private happinefs, which  
the people of the Onited States to pe-  
culiarly enjoy.  
  
V\ e are fully fenfible of the advan-  
tages that have refuked from the a-  
doption of mealures (which you have  
fuccefsfully cat i led into effect ) to pre-  
fei ve peace, cultivate friend (hip, and  
promote civilization amonglt the Indi-  
an tribes, on the wellem frontiers ; —  
feelings of humanity, and the molt fo-  
lk] political irttereits, equally encou-  
rage tht continuance ol this fyllein.  
  
We obi&#x27;erve with pleafure, that the  
delivery of the military polls, lately  
occupied by the Britifll forces, within  
the territory of the United .States, was  
made with cordiality and prompti-  
tude, as foon as circumftances would  
admit ; and that the other provilions  
of our treaties with Great Britain and  
Spain, that were objects of eventual  
arrangements, are about being carried  
into effect, with entire harmony and  
gjod faith.  
  
The unfortunate, but unavoidable  
difficulties, that oppofed a timely com-  
pliance with the terms of the \lge-  
rine treaty, are much to be lamented ;  
as they may occalion a temporary fuf-  
penlion of the advantages to be deriv-  
ed from a folid peace with that pow,  
er, and a perfect fee urity from its pre-  
datory warfare : at the lame time, the  
lively imprellions that affected the  
public mind, on the redemption of our  
capi ivc fellow citizens, afford the mod  
laudable incentive to our exertions,  
to remove the remaining obftacles.  
  
We perfectly coincide with \ ou in  
opinion tha^the importance of dur  
commerce demands a naval force for  
its protection againtl foreign lnfult  
and depredation, and our fohcitude to  
attain that object will be always pro-  
portionate to its magnitude.  
  
The neceflity of accelerating the ef-  
tablifhment of certain ufeful manufac-  
tures, bv the intervention of legisla-  
tive aid and protection, and the en-  
couragement due to agriculture, by  
the creation of boards (compofed of  
intelligent individuals) to patrbnifc  
this primary put fuit of fociety, are  
fubjects which will readily engage our  
. nun! ferious attention.  
  
A national univetfity may be convert-  
ed to the moll ufeful purpofes. The  
ffience of legillation, being fo eflenti-  
ally dependent on the endowment of  
the mind, the public huerelts mull re-  
ceive effectual aid from the general  
difftifion of knowledge ; an«l the U-  
nited States will all&#x27;ume a more digni-  
fied Ration among the nations of the  
earth, by the fwecefsful cultivation of  
the higher branches of literature.  
  
A military academy may be like-  
wife rendered equally important. To  
aid and direct the phv f;cal force of the  
nation, by cherilhing a military (&quot;pint,  
enforcing a proper fenfe of difcipline,  
and inculcating a fcieiitific fyllem of  
tactics, is conlbnant to the fotmdeil  
maxims of public policy : connected  
•with, and fupportcd by fuch an efta-  
blifhment, a well regulated militia,  
conftirutino the natural defence of the  
country, the inolt effectual as well as  
economical, prefcrvative of peace.  
  
We cannot but confider with feri-  
ous appi ehenlions, the inadequate  
compenlations of che public oliicei s,  
efpecially of thole in the mot e impor-  
tant ftationt. It is not only a violati-  
on of the fpirit of a public contract,  
ut is an evil fo extenfive in its opera-  
&quot;om, and fo deltruCtive in its confe-  
rences, that we trull it will receive  
e moll pointed legiflative attention.  
We fmcerely lament, that whilfl  
the conduct of the United States has  
been uniformly imprefled with the  
character of equity, moderation, and  
love,of peace, in maintainance of all  
their foreign relationfhips, our trade  
jhould be fo harralled by the cruifers  
and agents of the republic of France  
throughout the extenfive departments  
of the Well Indies.  
  
Whilll we are confident that no  
caufe of complaint exills. that could  
authorife an interruption of our tran-  
quility, or difehgage that republic  
from the bonds 0 f amity, cemented by  
  
the faith of treaties, we cannot but

man of the Senate Committee, and William Smith  
of the same State, Chairman of the House Com  
mittee. We will give such portions of both replies  
as are pertinent to the subject under consideration,  
The reply of the Senate ran as follows   
while contemplating the causes that produce this  
anspicious result, we must acknowledze the excellence  
of the constitutional system, and the wisdom of the  
legislative provislons;  but we should be deficlent  
in gratitude and justice did we not attribute a  
gieat portion of these advantages to the virtue, firin,  
fiess and talents of your administration, which have  
been conspicuouisly displayed in the most trying times,  
and on the most critical occasions. It is therefore  
with the sincerest regrets that we now receive an offlcial  
notification of your intention to retire from the public  
employments of your country,  
When we review the various scenes of your public­  
life, so long and so successfully devoted to the most  
ardious services, civil and military, as well during the  
struggles of the American Revolution as the convuleive  
periods of a recent date, we cannot look forward to your  
Ietirement without our warmest affections and most  
anxious regards accompanying you, and without  
mingling with our fellow-citizens at large in the sine­  
cerest wishes for your personal happiness that senat­  
bility and attachment can express.  
The most effectual consolation that can offer for the  
loss we are about to sustain arises from the animating  
reflection that the influence of your example will extend  
to your successors, and the United States thus continue  
to enjoy an able, upright, and energetic administration
