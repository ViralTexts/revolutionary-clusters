, the wild Irish who had gotten possession of the valley between the blue ridge and North mountain, forming a barrier over which none ventured to leap, and would still less venture to settle among. in such a state of things, scarcely admitting any change of station, society would settle  
			 itself down into several strata, separated by no marked lines, but shading off imperceptibly, from top to bottom, nothing disturbing the order of their repose. there were then, Aristocrats, half  
			 breeds, pretenders, a solid independant yeomanry, looking askance at those above, yet not venturing to justle them; and last,
