5th. Governor Rutlidge of South Carolina came to Head Qrs. with representations of the situation of Southern affairs, &amp; to sollicit  
  
aids. I communicated the plan of Campaign to him &amp; candidly exposed the true State of our Circumstances which convinced him—or seemed to do so—that no relief cd. be given from this army till we had acquired a Naval Superiority and cd. transport Troops by Water.  
  
  
John Rutledge was at this time governor of South Carolina. Rutledge had left Philadelphia 23 May to visit Headquarters at New Windsor, N.Y., before returning to South Carolina (LMCCEdmund C. Burnett, ed. Letters of Members of the Continental Congress. 8 vols. 1921–36. Reprint. Gloucester, Mass., 1963., 6:96). Presumably his mission was to relay to GW the hopes of the southern delegates in the Continental Congress for a summer campaign in the South rather than an attack on New York.  
  
  
  
  
7th. A Letter from the Govr. of Virginia dated at Charlottesville the 28th. Ulto. representing the distressed State of Virginia &amp; pressing my repairng thither, was received—other letters (but not official) speak of Lord Cornwallis’s advance to Hanover Court House—that the Marquis was retreating before him towards Fredericksburg and that General Leslie was embarked in James River with about 1200 Men destined, as was supposed, to Alexandria whither it was conjectured by the letter writers Lord Cornwallis was pointing his March.  
Accts. from Pittsburg were expressive of much apprehension for that quarter as a force from Canada was expected thither by way of the Lakes and the Alligany River.  
A Letter from the Executive of Pennsylvania afforded little hope of assistance in the article of Provision or other things from that State and was more productive of what they had done, than what they meant to do.

11th. Received Letters from the Marqs. de la Fayette, containing information of Lord Cornwallis’s movements from Westover, and that, at the date of his letter—the 3d. Instt.—he had advanced to the North Anna—but his design was not sufficiently understood  
  
—supposed Fredericksburg. The Marqs. was retreating before him with abt. 3000 Men Militia included—the Enemys force exclusive of Leslies detachment being estimated at five or 6000 Men, 600 of wch. were Horse.  
  
  
  
13th. To facilitate the building, and repairing of Boats, a number of Carpenters was ordered from the line of the army to the Q. M. G. to aid the artificers of his department in this important business and Major Darby with a Captain 5 Subs &amp; 6 Sergts. and 100 Rank &amp; file were drawn from the army in order to collect and take care of the public Boats.  
  
  
Samuel Darby (d. 1807) had served as a captain in various Massachusetts regiments and was promoted to major in the 7th Massachusetts in 1778. Darby’s instructions were contained in General Orders, 19 June 1781 (DLC:GW).  
  
  
  
  
14th. Received agreeable acts. from General Greene, of his Successes in South Carolina—viz.—that Lord Rawden had abandoned Cambden with precipitation, leaving all our wounded taken in the action of the 25th. of April last, together with 58 of his own too bad to remove—that he had destroy’d his own Stores—burnt many buildings and in short left the Town little better than a heap of Rubbish—That Orangeburg, Forts Mott. &amp; Granby, had surrendered; their Garrisons including officers consisting of near 700 Men—That Ninety Six &amp; Fort Augusta were invested—that he was preparing to March to the Former and that, Lord Rawden was at Nelsons ferry removing the Stores from that place which indicated an Evacuation thereof.

16th. Directed that no more Invalids be transferred till further Orders—that a detachment be formed of the weakliest Men for garrisoning of West point &amp; that a Camp be marked out by the Chief Engineer &amp; Q. M. Genl. near Peekskill to assemble the Troops on.  
  
  
GW’s command that no men were “to be transferred to the Corps of Invalids untill further orders” is in General Orders, 15 June 1781 (DLC:GW). The Corps of Invalids had been established 16 July 1777 for the utilization of veterans who were not fit for active service but were still able to perform such assignments as garrison duty (JCCWorthington Chauncey Ford et al., eds. Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789. 34 vols. Washington, D.C., 1904–37., 8:554–56).  
  
  
  
  
18th. Brigaded the Troops, and made an arrangement of the Army, which is to March for the New Camp in three divisions—the 1st. on Thursday the 21st.—the 2d. on the 23d. and the 3d. on the 24th. Instt. To strengthen the detachment intended for the Garrison of West point, I had previously called upon the State of Connecticut for 800 Militia.  
  
  
Headquarters was being moved from New Windsor, N.Y., to Peekskill, N.Y. (see General Orders, 19 June 1781, DLC:GW).  
  
  
  
  
20th. Recd. Letters from Genl. Clinton at Albany inclosing the examination of two Prisoners taken at Crown point by wch. and other intelligence it appears that no Troops had landed at that place and that the enemys Shipping only, had ever been there. In consequence, the Continental Troops to the No[rth]ward were ordered to be in readiness to join the army on the shortest notice &amp; Governor Clinton informed thereof that the New levies of the State, &amp; nine months, men might be hastened to relieve them.

and the attack by Lt. Col. John Graves Simcoe on Point of Fork, at the confluence of the James and Rivanna rivers in Virginia, 5 June 1781. At this time the Virginia legislature was meeting in Charlottesville and Thomas Jefferson and the members of the legislature whom he was entertaining at Monticello barely escaped capture. Aside from a few prisoners taken, including seven members of the legislature, the principal result of the raids was the capture by the British of a considerable store of arms and ammunition at Point of Fork and the destruction of a similar store at Charlottesville (TARLETONBanastre Tarleton.

Fune 5th—Governor Rutlidge of  
South Carolina came to Head Qrs with  
representations of the situation of south-  
ern affairs, and to sollicit aids—I com-  
municated the plan of campaign to him  
—and candidly exposed the true state of  
our circumstances which convinced him  
—or seemed to do so—that no relief cd.  
be given from this army till we had ac-  
quired a naval superiority and cd. trans-  
port Troops by Water.—  
  
Fune.th—A Letter from the Govr.  
of Virginia dated at Charlottesville the  
28th ulto. representing the distressed  
  
115  
  
state of Virginia &amp; pressing my repair-  
ing thither, was received—other letters  
(but not official) speak of Lord Corn-  
wallis’s advance to Hanover Court House  
—that the Marquis was retreating before  
him towards Fredericksburg—and that  
General Leslie was embarked in James  
River about 1200 men destined, as was  
supposed, to Alexandria whither it was  
conjectured by the letter writers Lord  
Cornwallis was pointing his march.—  
  
Accts. from Pittsburg were expressive  
of much apprehension for that quarter  
as a force from Canada was expected  
thither by way of the Lakes and the  
Alligany River.  
  
A Letter from the Executive of Pen-  
sylvania afforded little hope of assistance  
in the article of Provision or other things,  
from that state—and was more produc-  
tive of what they had done, than what  
they meant to do.—

Fune 11th—Received Letters from  
the Marqs. de la Fayette containing in-  
formation of Lord Cornwallis’s move-  
ments from Westover. and that, at the  
date of his letter—the 3d Inst.—he had  
advanced to the North Anna.—but his  
design was not sufficiently understood—

men Militia included—the Enemy’s force  
exclusive of Leslie’s detachment being  
estimated at five or 6000 men. 600 of  
wch were Horse.  
  
Fune 13th—To facilitate the build-  
ing, and repairing of Boats, a number of  
Carpenters was ordered from the line of  
the army to the Q. M. G: to aid the ar-  
tificers of his department in this impor-  
tant business.—and Major Darby with a  
Captain 5 subs—6 Sergts. and 100 Rank  
and file were drawn from the army in  
order to collect and take care of ye pub-  
lic Boats.  
  
Fune 14th—Received agreeable accts.  
from General Greene of his successes in  
  
South Carolina—viz—that Lord Rawdon  
had abandoned Cambden with precipita-  
  
tion, leaving all our wounded taken in  
the action of the 25th of April last, to-  
gether with 58 of his own too bad to re-  
move.—that he had destroy’d his own  
stores— burnt many buildings and in  
short left the Town little better than a  
heap of Rubbish—That Orangeburg,  
Forts McH. &amp; Granby, had surrendered ;  
their Garrisons including officers con-  
sisting of near 7oo men—That ninety  
six &amp; Fort Augusta were invested—that  
he was preparing to march to the Former  
—and that, Lord Rawdon was at Nel-  
sons ferry removing the stores from that  
place which indicated an Evacuation  
thereof.—  
  
June 16th—Directed that no more  
Invalids be transferred till further orders.  
—that a detachment be formed of the  
weakliest men for garrisoning’ West  
point and that a camp be marked out by  
the Chief Engineer and Q M Genl  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
near Peekskill to assemble the Troops  
on.—  
  
June 18th—Brigaded the Troops, and  
made an arrangement of the army, which  
is to march for the new Camp in three  
divisions—the 1st on Thursday the 21st.  
—the 2d on the 23d.—and the 3d on  
the 24th. inst.  
  
To strengthen the detachment in-  
tended for the garrison of West point, I  
had previously called upon the State of  
Connecticut for 800 militia.  
  
June 20th—Rec d. Letters from  
Genl. Clinton at Albany inclosing the ex-  
amination of two Prisoners taken at  
Crown point by wch. and other intelli-  
gence it appears that no Troops had  
landed at that place and that the enemys  
shipping only, had ever been there—In  
consequence, the Continental Troops to  
the No.ward were ordered to be in readi-  
ness to join the army on the shortest no-  
tice and Governor Clinton informed  
thereof that the new levies of the State  
and nine months men might be hastened  
to relieve them.—
