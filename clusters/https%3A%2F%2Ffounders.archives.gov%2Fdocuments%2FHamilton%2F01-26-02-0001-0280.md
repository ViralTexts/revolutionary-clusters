[New York] August 17th, 1804.  
Dear Sir,  
  
To comply with your request is a painful task; but I will repress my feelings while I endeavour to furnish you with an enumeration of such particulars relative to the melancholy end of our beloved friend Hamilton, as dwell most forcibly on my recollection.  
When called to him, upon his receiving the fatal wound, I found him half sitting on the ground, supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of death I shall never forget. He had at that instant just strength to say, “This is a mortal wound, Doctor;” when he sunk away, and became to all appearance lifeless. I immediately stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas! ascertained that the direction of the ball must have been through some vital part.  
For the satisfaction of some of General Hamilton’s friends, I examined his body after death, in presence of Dr. Post and two other gentlemen. I discovered that the ball struck the second or third false rib, and fractured it about in the middle; it then passed through the liver and diaphragm, and, as nearly as we could ascertain without a minute examination, lodged in the first or second lumbar vertebra. The vertebra in which it was lodged was considerably splintered, so that the spiculæ were distinctly perceptible to the finger. About a pint of clotted blood was found in the cavity of the belly, which had probably been effused from the divided vessels of the liver.  
His pulses were not to be felt; his respiration was entirely suspended; and upon laying my hand on his heart, and perceiving no motion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone. I however observed to Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance for his reviving was immediately to get him upon the water. We therefore lifted him up, and carried him out of the wood, to the margin of the bank, where the bargemen aided us in conveying him into the boat, which immediately put off. During all this time I could not discover the least symptom of returning life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and temples, with spirits of hartshorne, applied it to his neck and breast, and to the wrists and palms of his hands, and endeavoured to pour some into his mouth. When we had got, as I should judge, about 50 yards from the shore, some imperfect efforts to breathe were for the first time manifest: in a few minutes he sighed, and became sensible to the impression of the hartshorne, or the fresh air of the water: He breathed; his eyes, hardly opened, wandered, without fixing upon any objects; to our great joy he at length spoke: “My vision is indistinct,” were his first words. His pulse became more perceptible; his respiration more regular; his sight returned. I then examined the wound to know if there was any dangerous discharge of blood; upon slightly pressing his side it gave him pain; on which I desisted. Soon after recovering his sight, he happened to cast his eye upon the case of pistols, and observing the one that he had had in his hand lying on the outside, he said, “Take care of that pistol; it is undischarged, and still cocked; it may go off and do harm;—Pendleton knows, (attempting to turn his head towards him) that I did not intend to fire at him.” “Yes,” said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his wish, “I have already made Dr. Hosack acquainted with your determination as to that.” He then closed his eyes and remained calm, without any disposition to speak; nor did he say much afterwards, excepting in reply to my questions as to his feelings. He asked me once or twice, how I found his pulse; and he informed me that his lower extremities had lost all feeling; manifesting to me that he entertained no hopes that he should long survive. I changed the posture of his limbs, but to no purpose; they had totally lost their sensibility. Perceiving that we approached the shore, he said, “Let Mrs. Hamilton be immediately sent for—let the event be gradually broken to her; but give her hopes.” Looking up we saw his friend Mr. Bayard standing on the wharf in great agitation. He had been told by his servant that Gen. Hamilton, Mr. Pendleton, and myself, had crossed the river in a boat together, and too well he conjectured the fatal errand, and foreboded the dreadful result. Perceiving, as we came nearer, that Mr. Pendleton and myself only sat up in the stern sheets, he clasped his hands together in the most violent apprehension; but when I called to him to have a cot prepared, and he at the same moment saw his poor friend lying in the bottom of the boat, he threw up his eyes and burst into a flood of tears and lamentation. Hamilton alone appeared tranquil and composed. We then conveyed him as tenderly as possible up to the house. The distresses of this amiable family were such that till the first shock was abated, they were scarcely able to summon fortitude enough to yield sufficient assistance to their dying friend.  
Upon our reaching the house he became more languid, occasioned probably by the agitation of his removal from the boat. I gave him a little weak wine and water. When he recovered his feelings, he complained of pain in his back; we immediately undressed him, laid him in bed, and darkened the room. I then gave him a large anodyne, which I frequently repeated. During the first day he took upwards of an ounce of laudanum; and tepid anodyne fomentations were also applied to those parts nearest the seat of his pain. Yet were his sufferings, during the whole of the day, almost intolerable.  
As his habit was delicate and had been lately rendered more feeble by ill health, particularly by a disorder of the stomach and bowels, I carefully avoided all those remedies which are usually indicated on such occasions.  
I had not the shadow of a hope of his recovery, and Dr. Post, whom I requested might be sent for immediately on our reaching Mr. Bayard’s house, united with me in this opinion. General Rey, the French Consul, also had the goodness to invite the surgeons of the French frigates in our harbour, as they had had much experience in gunshot wounds, to render their assistance. They immediately came; but to prevent his being disturbed I stated to them his situation, described the nature of his wound and the direction of the ball, with all the symptoms that could enable them to form an opinion as to the event. One of the gentlemen then accompanied me to the bed side. The result was a confirmation of the opinion that had already been expressed by Dr. Post and myself.  
During the night, he had some imperfect sleep; but the succeeding morning his symptoms were aggravated, attended however with a diminution of pain. His mind retained all its usual strength and composure. The great source of his anxiety seemed to be in his sympathy with his half distracted wife and children. He spoke to me frequently of them—“My beloved wife and children,” were always his expressions. But his fortitude triumphed over his situation, dreadful as it was; once, indeed, at the sight of his children brought to the bed-side together, seven in number, his utterance forsook him; he opened his eyes, gave them one look, and closed them again, till they were taken away. As a proof of his extraordinary composure of mind, let me add, that he alone could calm the frantic grief of their mother. “Remember, my Eliza, you are a Christian,” were the expressions with which he frequently, with a firm voice, but in pathetic and impressive manner, addressed her. His words, and the tone in which they were uttered, will never be effaced from my memory. At about two o’clock, as the public well knows, he expired.  
Incorrupta fides—nudaque veritas  
Quando ullum invenient parem?  
Multis ille quidem flebilis occidit.  
I am, Sir,   Your friend and humble serv’t,  
  
David Hosack.

August 17, lSOI. |  
Dear Sir—To comply with your it-!  
.quest is a painful task; but I will repress  
my feelings while 1 endeavor to furnish  
you w ith an enumeration of such parti­  
culars relative to the melancholy end  
of our beloved friend Hamilton as dwell  
most forcibly on inv recollection.  
When called to him upon his receiving  
th-* fa tal wound, I found him half &gt;i;tin*/ !  
on the ground, supported in the aims of j  
Mr Pendleton. His countenance of death ]  
I shall never forget. He had at that in­  
stant just strength enough to say, * This  
is a mortal wound, Doctoi;” when he  
sunk away, and Dccame to a!l appear­  
ance lifeless. 1 immediately stripped up his  
clothes, .and soon, alas! ascertained that  
the direction of the ball must have been  
through some vital pari.” His pulses were  
not to be felt, his respiration was entire  
y suspended, and upon laying my hand  
on his heart and perceiving no motion  
there, I considered him as irrecoverably  
t gone. I however, observed to Mr. Pen­  
dleton, that the only chance for his re­  
viving was immediately to get him upon  
the water. Me therefore lifted him up  
and carried him out of the wood to the  
margin of the bank where the bargemen  
aided us in conveying him to the&quot; boat,  
which immediately put off. During ah  
this time I could not discover the least  
svmnton of returning life. I now rubbed  
bis fice, Ii;&gt;s and temples with spirits of  
hartshorn applied it to his neck and  
breast and to I lie wrists and palms of hi­  
hands, and endeavored to pour some in­  
to his mouth. When we had got, as I  
should judge, about fifty yards from the  
shore, sonic imperfect efforts to breathe  
were for the first time manifest; in a few­  
minutes he sighed and became sensible  
to the impression cf the hartshorn or the  
  
fresh air of thr water. He breathed, hi*  
eyes, hardly open, wandered, without  
fixhg upon any object: to nur great joy  
he at length spoke. “My vision is indis­  
rinci” were his first words. His pulse be­  
came more perceptible, his respiration  
more regular, his sight returned. 1  
&#x27;hen examined the wound to know if  
:here was anv dangerous discharge of  
blood; upon slightly pressing hit side i&#x27;  
stave him pain,on which I desisted. Soon  
after recovering his sight he happened  
to cast his eye upon the case of pistols,  
and observing the one that he had in his  
hand lying on the outside, he said take  
caie of that pistol; it Is undischarged,and  
still cocked; it may go off and do harm.  
Pendleton knows” (attempting to turn  
his head towards him) ‘ that I did not in  
fend to fire at him”—“Yes,” said Mr  
Pendleton understanding his wish. 1  
have already made Or. Hosnck 8CQU&lt;rih*­  
ed with your determination ns to that.”  
He closed his eyes and remained calm,  
without any disposition to speak; nor  
did hesaymuch afterward except in re­  
ply to my question?. He asked mo once  
or twice howl found bis pulse, and he  
informed me that his lower extremities  
had lost their feeling, manifesting to me  
ihat he entertained no hopes that he  
should long survive I changed the pos­  
ture of his limbs hut to no purpose; they  
had entirely lost their sensibility. Per­  
ceiving that we approached the shore,  
he said, “Let Mrs. Hamilton be immedi  
ately sent for; let the event be gradually  
broken to her hut give her hopes V Look  
ingt up we saw his friend, Mr Payard,  
standing on the wharf in great agitation.  
He had been told by hisservant that Ge­  
neral Hamilton, Mr Pendleton, and my  
self had crossed the river in a boat to­  
gether and too well he conjectured the  
fatal errand, and foreboded the dreadful  
result.—Perceiving, as we came nearei  
that Mr PendMon and myself only sit  
up in the stern sheets, he clasped- his.  
hands together in the most violent ap­  
prehension; but when I called to have  
a cot prepared, and he at the sime  
moment saw his poor friend lying in  
the boa!, he threw up his e&gt;cs and  
hurst into a flood of tears and lamen­  
tation. Hamilton alone appeared tran  
Quil and composed. We then convey­  
ed him as tenderly as possible up to  
the house. The distresses of the amia­  
ble family were such that, till the first  
shock was abated, they were scarcely  
able to summon fortitude enough to  
vield sufficient assistance to their dying  
friend.  
  
Upon reaching trie house he became  
more languid occasioned probably by  
ihe agitation of his removal from the  
boat, f give him a little weak wine wa­  
ter. W hen he recovered his feeling he  
complained of a pain in his back, weini­  
medi itely undressed him, laid him in a  
bed, and darkened the room. 1 then  
gave him a large anodyne which 1 fre­  
quently repeat eJ. Daring the first day  
lie took upward*, of an ounce of lauda* j  
mini; and tepid anodyne fomentations  
were also applied to those parts nearest  
the seat of his pain. Vet were his suffer­  
ings during the whole of the day almos!  
intolerable Iliad not the shadow of  
i hope of his recovery; and Dr Pest,  
whom ! requested might be sent for im­  
mediately on our reaching Mr Bayard’*  
house, united w ith me in tfie opinion —  
General lUy, the French consul, also  
had th” good ness to invite the surgeons  
of the French frigate in our harbour, as  
they had much experience in gunshot  
wounds, to tender their assistance.—  
They immediately cam”, but t &gt; prevent  
his being disturbed, ( state*! to them his  
situation, described the nature of the  
wound, and the direction of the ball,  
with all the symptoms that could enable  
rheni to form an opinion as to the event.  
One of the gentlemen then accompanied  
me to the bedside. The result was n  
confirmation of the opinion that had al­  
readv been expressed by Dr Post and  
myself.  
  
During the night lie lind sonic imper­  
fect sleep, but the succeeding morning  
his symptoms were aggravated, attended  
however, w ith a diminution of pain. Hi*  
mind retained all its u-uial strength and  
compO&#x27;U* e. The great source of his anx­  
iety seemed to he in his sympathy with  
his half distracted wife and children.—  
He spoke to me frequently of them—  
“My beloved w ife and childi en” wereai  
ways expressions.— But hss fortitude tri­  
umphed over his situation, dreadful as it  
was once indeed at the sight of his chil­  
dren, brought to the bedside together, se­  
ven in r.nmber,iiisutterance,forsook him,  
he opened his eyes, gave them one look,  
and closed them again till they were ta­  
ken away. Asa proof of his extraordina­  
ry composure of mind, Set me add, that  
he alone could calm the frantic grief of  
their mother. “Remember, my Eliza  
you are a Christian,” were the expres­  
sions with which ho frequently, with a  
firm voice, hut in a pathetic and impres­  
sive manner, address d her. His word­  
and the tone in which they were uttered,  
will never be effaced from my memory.  
About two o’clock, as the public wei!  
know*, he expired—  
“Incorrupta fiJes—-nudaque verita3  
(lu* ndoulli nnt invenient parent?  
Mudsill e quid* m fit til* t-cciciit.

August 17, 1804.  
Dkar Sir: To comply with your request is a  
painful task; but I will repress my feeling while  
I endeavor to furnish you with an enumeration  
of such particulars relative to the melancholy end  
of our beloved friend Hamilton, as dwell most  
forcibly on my recollection.  
When called to him upon receiving the fatal  
wound, I found him half sitting on the ground,  
supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton. His  
countenance of death I shall never forget. He  
had at that instant just strength to say, &quot;this is a  
mortal wound, doctor,&quot; when he sunk away, and  
became to all appearances lifeless. I immediate­  
ly stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas ! ascer­  
tained that the direction of the&#x27;ball must have been  
through some vital part.* His pulses were not to  
be felt, his respiration was entirely suspended,  
and, upon laying my hand on his heart and per­  
ceiving no motion there, I considered him as  
irrecoverably gone. I, however, observed to  
Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance for his re­  
viving was immediately to get him upon water.  
We therefore lifted him up and carried him out of  
the wood to the margin of the bank, where the  
bargemen aided us in couveying him to the boat,  
and immediately put off. During all this time I  
could not discover the least symptom of returning  
life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and temples  
with spirits of hartshorn, applied it to big neck  
and breast, and to the wrists and palms of his  
hands, and endeavored to pour some into his  
mouth. When we had got, as I should judge,  
about iifty yards from the shore, some imperfect  
efforts to breathe wore, for the first time, manifest;  
in a few minutes he sighed and became sensible  
to the impression of the hartshorn or the fresh  
air of the water. He breathed; his eyes, hardly  
open, wandered, without fixing upon any object;  
to our great joy, he at length spoke. &quot;My vision  
is indistinct,&quot; were his first words. His pulse  
became more perceptible, his respiration more re­  
gular, his sight returned. I then examined the  
wound to know if there was any dangerous dis­  
charge of blood; upon slightly pressing his side it  
gave hi in pain, on which I desisted. Soon after  
recovering his sight he happened to east his eye  
upon the case of pistols, and observing the one  
that he had in his hand lying on the outside, be  
said, &quot; take care of that pistol, it is undischarged,  
and still cocked, it may go off and do harm. Pen­  
dleton knows&quot; (attempting to turn his head to­  
wards him) &quot; that I did not intend to fire at him.&quot;  
&quot; Yes,&quot; said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his  
* For the satisfaction of some of General Hamilton&#x27;s  
friends, I examined his body after death, in presence of  
l)r. Post and two other gentlemen. I discovered that the  
ball struck the second or (bird false rib, and fractured it  
about in the middle; it then passed through the liver and  
diaphragm, and as far as we could ascertain without a  
inihnte examination, lodged in the first or second lumber  
vertebra. The vertebra in which it was lodged was con­  
siderably splintered, so that the spicule were distinctly  
perceptible to the finger. About a pint of clotted blood  
was found in the cavity of the belly, which had proba­  
bly been effused from the divided vessels of the liver.

wish, &quot; I have already made Dr. Hosack ac­  
quainted with your determination as to that.&quot;  
He then closed his eyes and remained calm, without  
any disposition to speak; nor did he say much af­  
terwards, except in reply to my question. He  
asked me once or twice how I found his pulse; and  
he informed me that his lower extremities had lost  
all feeling, manifesting to me that he entertained  
no hopes that he should long survive. ?  
I changed the posture of his limbs, but to no  
purpose; they had entirely lost their sensibility.  
Perceiving that wo approached the shore, he  
said, &quot; let Mrs. Hamilton be immediately sent for;  
let the event be gradually broken to her, but give  
her hopes.&quot; Looking up we saw his friend, Mr.  
Bayard, standing on the wharf in great agitation.  
He had been told by his servant that General  
Hamilton, Mr. Pendleton and myself, had crossed  
the river in a boat together, and too well he con­  
jectured the fatal errand; and foreboded the dread­  
ful result.  
Perceiving as we came nearer, that Mr. Pendle­  
ton and myself, only sat up in the stern sheets, he  
clasped his hands together in the most violent ap­  
prehension, but when I called to, him to have a  
cot prepared, and he at the same moment, saw his  
poor friend lying in the bottom of the boat, he  
threw up his eyes and burst into a flood of tears  
and lamentation.?Hamilton alone appeared tran­  
quil and composed. We then conveyed him as  
tenderly as possible up to the house. The dis­  
tresses of the amiable family were such that, till  
the first shock was abated, they were scarcely  
able to summon fortitude enough to yield sufficient  
assistance to their dying friend.  
Upon our reaching the house, he became more  
languid, occasioned probably by the agitation of  
his removal from the boat. I gave - him a little  
weak wine and water. When he recovered his  
feelings, he complained of a pain in his back; we  
immediately undressed him, laid him in abed, and  
darkened the room, I then gave him a large  
anodyne, which I frequently repeated. During  
the first day, he took upward of an ounce of  
laudanum; and tepid anodyne, fomentations, were  
also applied to those pnrts nearest the seat of his  
pain. Yet were his sufferings during the whole of  
the day almost intolerable.t I had not the shadow  
of a hope of his recovery; and Dr. Post, whom I  
requested might be sent for immediately on our  
reaching Mr. Bayard&#x27;s house, united with me in  
this opinion. Gen. Rev, the French consul, also  
had the goodness to invite the surgeons of the  
French frigates in our harbor, as they had much  
experience in gunshot wounds, to render their as­  
sistance. They immediately came; but to prevent  
his being disturbed, I stated to them his situation,  
described the nature ol the wound, and the direc­  
tion of the ball, with all the symptoms that could  
enable them to form an opinion as to the event.  
One of the gentlemen then accompanied me to the  
bedside. The result was a confirmation of the  
opinion that had already been expressed by Dr.  
Post and myself.  
During the night he had some imperfect sleep,  
but the succeeding morning his symptoms were  
aggravated, attended, however, with a diminution  
of pain. His mind retained all its usual strength  
and composure. The great source of his anxiety  
seemed to be in his sympathy with his half-dis­  
tracted wife and children. He spoke to me  
frequently of them?&quot; My beloved wife and  
children&quot; were always his expressions. But his  
fortitude triumphed over his situation, dreadful as  
it was; once, indeed, at the sight of his children,  
brought to the bedside together, seven in number,  
his utterance forsook him; he opened his eyes,  
gave them one look, and closed them again till they  
were taken away.  
As a proof of his extraordinary composure of  
mind, let me add, that he alone could calm the  
frantic grief of their mother. &quot; Remember, my  
Eliza, you are a Christian,&quot; were the expressions  
with which he frequently, with a firm voice, but  
in a pathetic and impressive manner, addressed  
her. His words, and the tone in which they  
were uttered, will never be effaced from my memo­  
ry. About two o&#x27;clock, the public well knows, he  
expired?  
&quot;Incorrapta fides?nudaque Veritas  
Quoada uilum iuvenienrparem ?

diately stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas!  
ascertained that the direction of the ball must  
ha? beep throuslreome vital jart. Hia nulm  
  
were net to be fell, bis respiration was eutirely  
suspended, and, upon laying tny hand on his  
heart and perceivinr? no motion there I consid  
  
ered hirh as irrecoverably gone. L, ho&#x27;werer,  
observed toMr. Pendleton, that the only chance  
for his reviving was immediately to get him upon  
the water. We therefore lifted him up and car­  
ried himttt olthe wood to the margin &#x27;of the  
bank, where the bargemen aided . us in convey,  
ing him to the boat, which immediately put off  
Datih&quot; this time I couid not, discover the

foMhe first time., manifest, in a few nnnotes he

Mr Pendleton, understanding his&#x27; wish &#x27;&#x27;I.have  
  
already made Dr. Hosack acquainted with your  
determination a3 to that.&quot; ! He then closed his  
eyes and &quot;ernained calm, without any disposition  
  
in reply to my questions.&quot; He asked me once  
or twice how 1 found his pulse j and-he informed  
mt that bis lower extremities had lost all feeling,  
manifesting to me that he entenaiad no hopes  
that he should long survive.  
1 changed the posture, of his limbs, but to  
no purpose,; they had entirely lost their sensi.  
bility. j . : . : ; &#x27;-; v;.vW.&#x27;Vv &#x27; ;  
Perceiytrig that we approached the shore, he  
said, &#x27;let Mrs. Hamilton be &#x27;immediately sent  
for let the event be gradually broken to- her, but  
give her hopes.&quot; Looking up we saw his friend,  
Mr. Bayard, standing on the wharf in&#x27; great  
agitation.!, lie had, been told by; his servant that  
General Hamilton, Mr. Pendleton and myself)  
had crossed the river in a boat together, and too  
well he conjectured the fatal-errand, and forebo­  
ded the dreadful result. ; i &#x27;I.  
  
: Perceiting as we camejiearer, that Jlr. - Pen­  
dleton and myself only sat up in the stern sheets,  
he clasped his hands together irr the most&#x27; vio­  
lenlapprtbension, but when I called to him to  
have a cot prepared.and he at the same moment  
sawjiis poor friend lying in the bottom of the  
boat, be threw up his eyes and burst into a flood  
of tears and lamentation. Hamilton alone ap­  
peared tranquil and composed. We then con­  
veyed hirn as tenderly as possible up to the house.  
The distresses of the amible family were such  
that, .till the first - shock was abated, they were  
scarcely able to summon fortitude enough to  
yield sufiicient assistance to their dying friend.  
; Upon, our reaching tae housa he became  
more languid, occasioned probably by the agita­  
tion of bis! removal from the boat. I gave him  
a little Weak wine and water. When he reco v­  
ered bis feelings, he.coaplained of a pain in his  
back; W? immediately undressed htm, laid him  
in abed and darkened the room, I then gave him  
a targe ahodyr. v which I frequexrtly repeated.  
During the first day, betook upward of an dance  
cflaudaaum; and tepid anodyne, fjmen&#x27;.-licr.s  
were also applied to those parts nearest the seat

but I will represa my feeling while I endeavor lo

When called to him upon receiving the fatal

. August 17, 1804.  
Dear Sir: . ; : ..&#x27; -j  
To comply &#x27; with your request is a  
pajnful task ; but 1 will repress my feel­  
ings while j I; endeavor U furnish you  
with an enumeration of such particulars  
relative to the melancholy end of our be-,  
loved friend Hamilton, jas dwell most for­  
crbl y on my recollectioli. f  
When called to him uppn his receiving  
the fatal wound; I found him half; sitting  
on the ground supported in the arms of  
Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of  
death I shall never forget, fie , had ai  
that instant just strength Vo say, &quot;this is  
a mortal wound, doctor,&#x27; J &quot;when he sunk1  
away and became to all appearance life  
less. I immediately stripped up &#x27; his  
clothes, and $oon, alas! ascertained that  
the direction of the ball must have been  
through same vital part;! His pulses were  
not to befell, his respiration was entirely  
suspended, and, upon laying my hand on  
his heart end perceiving rfo motion there,  
I considered hirn as irrecoverably gone.  
1, however, ; observed to Mr. Pendleton,  
that the only chance forj his reviving was  
immediately to get. him j upon the water.  
We therefore lifted him tip and. carried  
him out ot the wood to the margin of the  
bank, where the bargejraeh aided us in  
conveying him to the boat, which imme­  
diately put off. During all this I could  
not discover the least symptom of return­  
ing life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and:  
temples with spirits of hartshorn, applied;  
it to his neck and breast, and to the wrists  
and palms of his- hands and endeavored  
to pour some into his mouth. When we  
had got, as I should judge, about fifty  
yards from the shore, sbrrie imperfect efJ  
torts to breathe were, for. the first time,  
manifest, in, a few minutes he sighed,  
and became sensible to the impression of  
the, hartshorn or the fresh, air of .the wa­  
ter. He breathed ; , his eyes, hardly open,  
wandered, .without fixing upon any ob  
ject; to pur- great jojr, he at length  
spoke. &quot; My vision; is; indistinct,! were  
his first words. His pulse became: more  
perceptible, his respiration more regular,  
hia sight returned. I then examined the  
wound to know if tberel was any danger­  
oua discharge of blood : upon slightly  
pressing his side it gave, &#x27; him paw, oo  
which I Resisted. Soon after recovering  
his sight be happened to eat f bis eye.op­  
bn tha case of pistpls, nd obstyrfing the  
one that he had in his hand lying on the  
  
... it.  
  
outside, he aaid, &quot; take care of that pistolj  
it is undischarged, and still cocked ; it:  
may go off and do harm.&#x27; Pendleton!  
knows&quot; (attempting to turn his head to­  
wards him) &quot;that I did not intend to fire;  
at him.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Pendleton,;  
mderstanding his wish, &quot;I have already  
  
rnaae ur. Hosack acquainted witn your;  
determination as to that. He then closed  
his eyes and remained calm, without any!  
disposition to speak j nor did he say much  
afterward, except in reply to my questions.  
He asked me once or twice how I found  
his pulse ; and he informed me that his ex­  
tremities had lost ail feeling, manifesting  
to me that he entertained-no hopes that  
he should long! survive. I  
I changed the posture.of his limbs, but  
to no purpose; they had entirely . lost  
their sensibility. i v  
Perceiving that we approaches! the  
shore, he $a id, &#x27; let Mrs. Hamiltonibe im­  
mediately sent &#x27;for ; Jet the event be gra­  
dually broken to her, but give her hopes.&quot;  
Looking up we saw his friend, Mr. Ba­  
yard, standingion the wharf in great agi­  
tation. He hat! been told by his servant  
that General tlamilton, Mr. Pendleton  
and myself, had crossed the river in a  
boat together, and too well he conjectured  
the fatal errand, and forboded the dread­  
ful result. &#x27; i  
Perceiving as we canle nearer, that  
Mr. Pendleton1 and myself only sat up  
in tne stern sheets, he clasped his hand  
together in the. most violent appehen­  
51011, when I called to hini to&#x27; have a cot  
prepared, and heat the same moment ?av  
bis poor friend lying in&#x27; the bottom of the  
boat, he tbFew up his eyes and burst into  
a flood of tears and lamentation. &#x27; Hamil  
ton alone anneared tranouil and com-  
posed We then conveyed him as ten­  
derlv as possible up to the house. The  
distresses of the amiable family were such  
that, till the first shock was abated, thev  
- - j  
were scarcely able to summon fortitude  
enough to yield sufficient assistance to  
their dying friend.  
Upon our reaching the house he be­  
came more languid, occasioned probably  
by the agitation of his removal Irom the  
boat. I gave hm a little Weak wine and  
water. When he recovered his feelings,  
he complained of a pain in his back; .we  
immediately undressed hinij laid him  
in a bed and darkened the room, I then  
gave him a large anodyne&#x27;, which I fre­  
quently repeated. During the first day,  
he took upward of an ounce of laudanum :  
ana tepid anodyne, fomentations were  
i i:j i .i. . . . . ?  
aijsu uppneu to uiose parts nearest tne  
seat of pain. &quot;Yet were his sufferings  
duringthe whole of the day almost in  
tolerable. I ; had not the shadow of n  
hope of his recovery ; and Dr. Post,  
whom I requested might be sent for im­  
mediately on cu r reach ing M r. Ba ya rd &#x27;s  
house, united with me in this opinion.  
Gen. Rey, the French consul, also Had  
the goodness to invite the surgeons of  
the French frigates in our harborias they  
had much experience in gunshot wounds,  
to render their assistance. They imme­  
diately came ; but to prevent his being  
disturbed, I stated to them his situation,  
described the nature of the wound, and  
the direction of the ball, with all the  
symptoms that could enable them &#x27;to  
form an opinion; as to the event. One  
of the gentlemen then accompanied me  
to the bed side. The. result was a con  
firmation of the opinion .that had al­  
ready been expressed. by Dr. Post and  
myself r ;  
During the niirht he had some imper  
fect sleep, but the succeeding morning  
nis symptoms, were aggravates atienaeUi  
however, with a diminution of paiik r  
His-mind retained all its usual strength  
and composure. ! The great source 6f  
his anxiety seemed to be inhis sympha-  
thy with his haif-distracted wife and  
children. He spoke to me frequently  
of them &quot;My belofed wife and chil­  
dren&quot; were always his expressions. Hut  
nis iortituae triumpnea over nis situation,.  
dreadful as it was J once, indeedrat the  
sihtof his children, brought to the bed­  
side together, seven in number, his ut­  
terance forsook him ; he opened his eyes,  
gave them one look, and closed them  
again till they were taken away.  
As a prooi or nis extraordinary com-  
posure&#x27;ef mind, let me add, that he alone  
could calm the frantic grief of ihe mo-  
ther. Remember, mv Eliza, you are  
a Christian,&quot; were the expressions with  
which he frequently, with a firm voice,  
but in a pathetic and impressive manner.  
addressed her: His words, and the tone  
in which they were uttered, will never  
be effaced from my memory. About two  
oVlock, the public well know.i he ex­  
pired &#x27;!;! &#x27; ! . J &quot;

prepared, and he at the same moment saw his poor friend lying in the bot-  
tom of the boat, he threw up his eyes and burst into a flood of tears and  
lamentation. Hamilton alone appeared tranquil and composed. We then  
conveyed him as tenderly as possible up to the house. The distresses of  
this amiable family were such that till the first shock was abated, they were  
scarcely able tosummon fortitude enough to yield sufficient assistance to  
their dying friend.  
  
‘Upon our reaching the house he became more languid, occasioned pro-  
bably by the agitation of his removal from the boat. I gave him a little  
weak wine and water. When he reeovered his feelings, he complained of  
pain ia his back ; we immediately undressed him, laid him in bed, and  
darkened the room. I then gave him a large anodyne, which I frequently  
repeated. During the first day he took upwards of an ounce of laudanum ;  
and tepid anodyne fomentations were also applied to those parts nearest the  
seat of his pain—yet wete his sufferings, during the whole of the day, al-  
most intolerable.  
  
I had not a shadow of a hope of his recovery, and Dr Post, whomI re-  
quested might be sent for immediately on our reaching Mr. Bayard’s house,  
united with me in this opinion. General Rey, the French Consul, also had  
the goodness to tuvite the surgeons of the French frigates in our harbor, as  
they had had much experience im gun-shot wounds, to render their assis-  
tance. They immediately came ; but to prevent his being disturbed I stated  
to them his situation, described the nature of his wound and the direction  
of the ball with all the symptoms that could enable them to form an opinion  
as to the event. One of the gentlemen then accompanied me to the bed-  
side. The result was a confirmation of the opinion that had already been  
expressed by Dr. Post and myself.  
  
* Daring the night, he had some imperfect sleep: but the succeeding  
morning his symptoms were aggravated, attended however with a diminu-  
tion of pain. His mind retained all its usual strength and composure. The  
great source of his anxiety seemed to bein his sympathy with his half dis-  
tracted wife and children. He spoke tome frequently of them—** My be-  
loved wife and children,” were always his expressions. But his fortitude  
triumphed over his situation, dreadful as it was ; once, indeed, at the sight  
of his children brought to the bed side together, seven in number, his ut  
terance forsook him ; he opened his eyes, gave them one look, and closed  
them again. till they were taken away. At about two o’clock, as the public  
well knows, he expired

ely took  
his aim, arid fired. Hi* ball entered (-Jen. Ham­  
ilton&#x27;s right side: as soon as the bullet struck  
him, he raised himself involuntarily on his toes,  
turned a little to the left, (at which moment his  
pistol went oft&#x27;,) and fell upon his face. Mr.  
Pendleton immediately called out for Dr. Hosack,  
who, in running to the spot, bail to pass Mr. Van  
Ness and Col. Burr: but Van Ness had the cool  
precaution to cover his principal with an umbrel­  
la, so that Dr. Hosack should not he able to swear  
that he saw him o?t the field. What parsed after  
this, the reader will have in the following letter  
August 17th, 1804.  
“Dear Sir— To comply with your request is a  
painful task; but 1 will repress my feelings w hile  
I endeavor to furnish you w ith an enumeration of  
suoh particulars relative to the melancholy end of  
our beloved friend Hamilton, as dwell most forci­  
bly on iny recollection.  
“When called to him, upon his receiving the  
fatal wound, l found him half sitting on the  
ground, supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton.  
His countenance of death 1 shall never forget—  
he had at that instant ju.*t strength to say, “This  
is a mortal wound Doctor;” when he sunk away  
and became to all appearance lifeless. I imme­  
diately -dripped up his clothes, and soon, al «s !  
ascertained that the direction of the hall must  
have been through some vital part. His pul*e*  
were not to be felt; his respiration was entirely  
suspended; and upon laying my hand upon his  
heart and perceiving no motion there, 1 consid­  
ered him as irrecoverably gone. 1 however ob­  
served to Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance  
for hi* reviving was immediately to gel him upon  
the water. We therefore lifted him up, and car­  
ried him out of the wood, to the margin of the  
bank, where the bargemen aided us in conveying  
him to the boat, which immediately put oft.—  
During all this time l could not discover the least  
symptom of returning iife. 1 now rubbed hi* face,  
lips, and temples, with spirits of hartshorne, ap­  
plied it to in* m*ck ami breast, and to the wrists  
and palms of his hands, and endeavoted to pour  
some into his mouth. When we had got, as 1  
should judge, about fifty yards from the shore,  
*ome imperfect efforts to breathe were for the  
first time manifest4, in a few minuets he sighed,  
! and became sensible to the impression of the  
! hartshorne, or the fiesh air of the water. He  
breathed; his eye*, hardly opened, wandered,  
without fixing upan any objects; to our great joy  
he at length spoke : “My vision is indistinct,” were  
his first word*. II is pulses became more percep­  
tible; his respiration more regular; his sight re­  
turned. 1 then examined the wound to know if  
there was any dangerous discharge of blood; up­  
on slightly pressing his side it gave hun pain; on  
which I de*isted. Soon after recovering his sight,  
he happened to cast his eye upon the case of pis­  
j to!*, and observing ;he otic he had had in his hand,  
lying on the outside, he said, “ I ake care of that  
pistol; it is undischarged, am) still cocked; it may  
go otl and do harm;— Pendleton knows, (attempt­  
ing to turn his head towards him) that 1 did not  
intend to fire at him.” “Yes,” said Pendleton,  
understanding his wish, “1 have already made  
Dr. Hosack acquainted with your determination  
a* to that.” lie then closed hi* eyes and remain­  
ed calm, without any disposition to speak; nor  
did he say much afterward*, excepting in reply  
to my questions as to his feeling*. He a*ked me  
! once or twice how 1 found his pulse; an I he in­  
finimd me that his lower extremities had io*t all  
telling; manifesting to me that he should not long  
  
survive. I changed the posture of his limbs, but  
I to no purpose; they had totally lost their sensi­  
bility. Perceiving that we approached the shore,  
he said, “Let Mrs. Hamilton be immediately sent  
. for—let the event he gradually broken to her;  
but give her hopes.” Looking up we saw his  
friend Mr. Jtayuid standing on the wliarl in great  
agitation, lie had been t&lt;dd by his servant that  
General Hamilton, Mr. Pendleton, and my­  
self, ha 1 crossed the river in a boat together, and  
too well he conjectured the fatal errand, and  
foreboded tne dreadful result. Perceiving, we  
came nearer, that Mr. Pendleton and myself only  
sat up in the stern-sliccts, he clasped his hands  
together in the most violent apprehension; but  
when l called to him to have a cot prepared, and  
he at the same moment saw his poor fritnd lying  
in the bottom of the boat, he threw up his eyes  
and burst into a flood ol tears and lamentation.—  
Hamilton alone appeared tranquil and composed.  
NVe then conveyed him as tenderly as possible  
up to the house. The distresses ot this amiable  
family were such that till trie first sho&lt; k was  
abated, they were scarcely able to summon forti­  
tude enough to yield sufliciail assistance to their |  
dying friend  
  
•‘Upon our reaching the hou«e he became more  
languid, occasioned probably by the ag.tal.on of |  
bis removal from tbe boat, leave him a little |  
weak wine and water. When he recovered his ;  
feeling he complained of pain in his back; we  
immediately undressed him, laid him in bed, ant!  
darkened the room. I then gave him a large ,  
anodvne, which l had frequently repeated. Du- .  
rin r the first dav he took upwards ot an ounce  
of laudanum; and tepid anodyne for mentation*  
were also applied to those parts nearest the seat  
of pain—yet were his &lt;uli&#x27;erings, during the  
whole of the day, almost intolerable.  
1 had not a shadow of a hope of his recovery, |  
and Dr. Post, whom l requested might he sent  
lor immediately on our reaching Mr. Bayard’s  
house, united with me in this opinion. General  
Kve. the French consul, had the goodness to in­  
vite the surgeons of the French frigates in our  
harbor, as they had much experience in gun­  
shot wound*, to render their assistance. I hey  
immediately came; hut to prevent his being dis­  
turbed 1 stated to them his situation, described  
the nature of his wound and the diiection o the  
hall, with all the -ymptoms that could enable  
them to form an opinion as to the event. One  
of the gentlemen then accompanied me to t he  
bed side. The result was a confirmation of the  
opinon that had already been expressed by Dr.  
Post and myself. .  
“During the night, he had some imperlect  
sleep; but the succeeding morning his symptoms  
were aggravated, attended however with a dim­  
inution of pain. His mind retained alt ils usual  
strength and composure. The gie«t source of  
his anxiety seemed to be in his sympathy with  
ids half distracted wife mid children. He spoke  
to me frequently of them—“My beloved wife  
and children.” were always his expression*.—  
But his fortitude trump!;*.] over his situation,  
dreaded, as it was; once, indeed, «l the sight of  
his children brought to the lied side together  
seven in number, his utterance forsook him; he  
opened his eyes, gave them one look, and closed  
them again, till they were taken away. At a­  
hnut two o’clock, as the public well knows, he  
cxpiied.

triumphed over his situation, dreadful, as it was:  
once, indeed, at the sight of his children brought  
to the bed side togethor, seven in number, his ut­  
terance forsook him; he opened his eyes, gave  
them one look, and closed them again, till they  
were taken away. At about two o&#x27;clock, as the  
public well knows, he expired.

enumeration of such particulars relative lo the &#x27;&quot;is they drew lots for the first shot the  
  
melancholy end of our beloved friend ilamil-  
ton, as dwell most forcibly on my recollection  
44 Yhen called to him, upon his receiving  
the fatal wound, I found him half sitting ou  
the ground, supported in the arms of Mr Pen­  
dleton. His countenance of death I never  
shall forget he had at that instant iust strength  
to say, &quot;This is a mortal wound Doctor.&quot;  
when he suuk away, and become to all an-  
pearance lifeless. I immediately shipped up  
his clothes, and soon, alas ! ascertained that  
the direct iou of the ball must have been throuoh  
some vital part. His Dulses were not lo  
felt; his respiration was entirely suspended;  
and upon laying mv hand upon his heart and  
perceiving no motion there, I considered hirn  
as irrecoverably gone. 1 however observed  
to Mr Peudlelon, that the only chance for his  
reviving was immediately to get him upon ihe  
water. e tnefeiore lilted hirn up, and car-  
ried him out of the wood, lo the margin of the  
bank, where the bargemen aided us in convev-  
ing nun 10 iuc uwai, wuicn imineuiatery put  
off. Duriug all this time I could not discover  
ibe least symptom of returning life. I now  
rubbed his lace, lips, and temples, with spirits  
of hartshorue, applied it to his ueck aud breast,  
and to the wrists and palms of his hands, and  
endeavored to pour some into bis mouth.  
- k. . . I 1 . ...l.&quot; u : IT . &#x27;I  
  
When we had got, as 1 should judge, about  
fifty yards from the shore, some imperfect  
efforts to breathe were for the first time mani­  
fest; iu a few minutes he sighed, and became  
sensible to the impression of the hartshorne,  
or the fresh air of the water. He breathed;  
his eyes, hardly opened, wandered, without  
fixing upon any objects ; to our great jov he  
at length spoke: -My vision is indistinct,&quot;  
were his first words. His pulses become more  
perceptible: his respiration more regular; his  
sight returned. I then examined the Wound  
to know if there was any dangerous dicharge  
of blood; upon slightly pressing his side it  
gave him pain; on which Ij desisted. Soon  
alter recovering his sight, he happeued to cast  
his eye upon the case of pistols, and observ­  
ing the oue he hid had in his hand lying on  
the outside, he said. &quot;Take care of that pis­  
tol; it is undischarged, and still cocked; it  
may go off and do harm; Pendleton knows,  
(attempting to turn his head towards him) that  
I did not intend to fire at him.&quot; &quot;Yea,&#x27;&quot; said  
Peudletoo, understanding his wish, &quot;I hate  
already made Dr Hosack acq jaiuted with  
your determination as to that.&quot; He then  
closed his eyes aud remained calm, without  
auy disposition to speak; nor did he say much  
afterward?, excepting in reply to my questions  
as to his leeli&#x27;igs. He asked me once or  
twice how I found his pulse: and he informed  
me that his lower extremities had lost all  
feeling ; manifesting to me that he entertain­  
ed no hopes that he should long survive. I  
changed the posture of his limbs, but to no  
purpose; they had totally lost their sensibility.  
Perceiving that we approached the shore, he  
said, &#x27;Let Mrs Hamilton be immediately sent  
for let the event be gradually broken to her;  
but give her hopes.&quot; Looking up we saw his  
frieud, Mr B iyaid standiug on the wharf iu  
great agitation. lie had been told by his ser­  
vant that Geu. Hamilton, Mr Pendleton, &amp;ud  
myself, had crossed the river iu a boat to­  
gether aud too well he conjectured the fatal  
erraud, and foieboded the dreadful result.  
Perceiving, as we came nearer, that Mr Pen­  
dleton and myself only sat up iu the stern­  
sheets, he clapped his hands together in the  
most violent apprehension; but when I called  
to him to have a cot prepared and he at the  
same moment saw his poor frieud lying iu  
the bottom of the boat, he threw up his eyes  
aud burst into a flood of tears aud lamenta­  
tion. Hamilton alone appeared tranquil aud  
composed. We then cotsveyed him as tender­  
ly as possible up to the house. The distresses  
of this amiable family were such thai till the  
  
l;rst shock was atiated, they were scarcely  
able t summon fortitude enough to yield suffi­  
cient assistance to their dying friend.  
&#x27;Upon our reaching the house he became  
more languid, occaisoued probably by the agi­  
tation of his removal from the boat. I gave  
him a little weak wiue aud water. When he  
recovered his feelings he complaiued of pain  
in his back; we immediately undressed him,  
laid him iu bed, aud darkened the room. I  
then g-ivo him a kt&#x27;ge auodyne, which I had  
fiequeutly. Du ing the first day he took up­  
wards of an ounce of Jaudnurn; and tepid  
anodvne fermeutalious iere also applied to  
those parts nearest the seat of his paiu yel

Hamilton&#x27;s return to the city, is one of  
thrilling interest. He says: &quot;I found

uttered an exclamation of pain,

announcement of the melancholy  
tidings. Mr. Bayard, a warm friend  
of the General&#x27;s having heard that  
he, in company with Mr. Pendleton  
and Dr. Hosack, had crossed the river  
in a boat together, and surmising  
the errand, and foreboding its un­  
happy result, was standing upon  
the dock awaiting their return. As  
the boat approached the spot, and  
he saw only Mr. P. and Dr. H. sit­  
ting up in the stern, he clasped his  
hands in an agony of apprehension,  
and when the Doctor called to him  
to have a cot prepared, and he saw  
his friend lying at the bottom of  
the boat, his fortitude forsook him,  
and he wept like a child. Tenderly  
as circumstances would permit he  
was conveyed to his home, where  
the shock to his amiable family was  
heightened by its suddenness and  
they were scarcely able to summon  
fortitude enough to render proper  
assistance. &quot;During the night,&quot;  
says Dr. Hosack, &quot;he had some im­  
perfect sleep, but the succeeding  
morning his symptoms were aggra­  
vated, attended, however, by a di­  
minution of pain. His mind retain­  
ed all its original strength and com­  
posure. The great source of his  
anxiety seemed to be in his svmpaty  
with his half-distracted wife and  
children. He spoke to me frequent­  
ly of them. &#x27;My beloved wife and  
children,&#x27; were always his express­  
ions. But his fortitude triumphed  
over his situation, dreadful as it  
was once, indeed, at the sight of  
his little childrenseven in number  
-brought to his bedside together,  
his utterance forsook him. He  
opened his eyes, gave them one  
look, and closed them again until  
they were taken away. As a proof  
of his extraordinary composure, let  
me add that he alone could restrain  
the franctic grief of their mother.  
&#x27;Remember, my Eliza, you are a  
christian!* was the expression with  
which he frequently, with a firm  
voice, bat in apathetic and impres-  
her.

words, and the tone in which Hhey  
were uttered, will never be effaced

They were both  
also wounded in the same month  
In Genr Hamilton&#x27;s case the liver was wound  
ed. In that of tho late President it was sup  
posed to be wounded, principally from the fact  
that the Surgeon-General of the navy, who, I  
believe, was selected to make the examinatiof  
thought the surgical tact of his finger was suf  
ficient to detect the tissue of that organ from  
that of the other soft tissues through which it  
passed  
Dr. Hosack&#x27;s letter is to be found in the see  
ond volume, page 315, of the &quot;Memoirs of Aaron  
Burr,&quot; edited by Matthew L. Davis, and the ex  
tract to which I allude is as follows  
For the satisfaction of some of Genr Hamil  
ton&#x27;s friends, I examined his body after death  
in presence of Dr. Post and two other gentle  
men. I discovered that the ball struck the see  
ond or third false rib, and fractured it about in  
the middle. It then passed through the liver  
and diaphragm, and, as far as we could ascer  
tain without a minute examination, lodged in  
the first or second lumbar vertebra. The ver  
tebra in which it was lodged was considerabl  
splintered, so that the spiculm were distinctl  
perceptible to the finger. About a pint of  
ted blood was found in the cavity of the bell  
which had probably been effused from the di  
vided vesseis of the liver

said: “Let Mrs. Hamilton be immediate­  
ly sent for; let the event be gradually  
broke to her, but give her hopes.” Look­  
ing up we saw his friend, Mr. Bayard,  
standing on the wharf in great agitation.  
He had been told by my servant that  
Gen. Hamilton, Mr. Pendleton and my­  
self had crossed the river in a boat to­  
gether, and too well he conjectured the  
fatal errand, and foreboded the dreadful  
result. Perceiving as we drew nearer  
that Mr. Pendleton and myself only sat  
up in the stern sheets, he clasped his  
hands together in the most violent ap­  
prehension; but when I called to him to  
have a cot prepared and ho at the same  
time saw his poor friend lying in the bot­  
tom of the boat, he threw up his eyes  
and burst into a flood of tears and lam­  
entations. We then conveyed him as  
tenderly as possible up to the house (to  
Bayard&#x27;s house, at Greenwich). The  
distress of his amiable family was such  
that till the first shock had abated they  
were scarcely able to summon fortitude  
enough to yield sufficient assistance to  
their dying friend.
