r  
Paris Aug. 10. 1787.  
  
I have received your two letters of Decemb. 30. and April 18. and am very happy to find by them, as well as by letters from Mr. Wythe, that you have been so fortunate as to attract his notice and good will: I am sure you will find this to have been one of the most fortunate events of your life, as I have ever been sensible it was of mine. I inclose you a sketch of the sciences to which I would wish you to apply in such order as Mr. Wythe shall advise: I mention also the books in them worth your reading, which submit to his correction. Many of these are among your father’s books, which you should have brought to you. As I do not recollect those of them not in his library, you must write to me for them, making out a catalogue of such as you think you shall have occasion for in 18 months from the date of your letter, and consulting Mr. Wythe on the subject. To this sketch I will add a few particular observations.  
1. Italian. I fear the learning this language will confound your French and Spanish. Being all of them degenerated dialects of the Latin, they are apt to mix in conversation. I have never seen a person speaking the three languages who did not mix them. It is a delightful language, but late events having rendered the Spanish more useful, lay it aside to prosecute that.  
2. Spanish. Bestow great attention on this, and endeavor to acquire an accurate knowlege of it. Our future connections with Spain and Spanish America will render that language a valuable acquisition. The antient history of a great part of America too is written in that language. I send you a dictionary.  
3. Moral philosophy. I think it lost time to attend lectures in this branch. He who made us would have been a pitiful bungler if he had made the rules of our moral conduct a matter of science.  For one man of science, there are thousands who are not. What would have become of them? Man was destined for society. His morality therefore was to be formed to this object. He was endowed with a sense of right and wrong merely relative to this. This sense is as much a part of his nature as the sense of hearing, seeing, feeling; it is the true foundation of morality, and not the truth, &amp;c., as fanciful writers have imagined. The moral sense, or conscience, is as much a part of man as his leg or arm. It is given to all human beings in a stronger or weaker degree, as force of members is given them in a greater or less degree. It may be strengthened by exercise, as may any particular limb of the body. This sense is submitted indeed in some degree to the guidance of reason; but it is a small stock which is required for this: even a less one than what we call Common sense. State a moral case to a ploughman and a professor. The former will decide it as well, and often better than the latter, because he has not been led astray by artificial rules. In this branch therefore read good books because they will encourage as well as direct your feelings. The writings of Sterne particularly form the best course of morality that ever was written. Besides these read the books mentioned in the inclosed paper; and above all things lose no occasion of exercising your dispositions to be grateful, to be generous, to be charitable, to be humane, to be true, just, firm, orderly, couragious &amp;c. Consider every act of this kind as an exercise which will strengthen your moral faculties, and increase your worth.  
4. Religion. Your reason is now mature enough to receive this object. In the first place divest yourself of all bias in favour of novelty and singularity of opinion. Indulge them in any other subject rather than that of religion. It is too important, and the consequences of error may be too serious. On the other hand shake off all the fears and servile prejudices under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a god; because, if there be one, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear. You will naturally examine first the religion of your own country. Read the bible then, as you would read Livy or Tacitus. The facts which are within the ordinary course of nature you will believe on the authority of the writer, as you do those of the same kind in Livy and Tacitus. The testimony of the writer weighs in their favor in one scale, and their not being against the laws of nature does not  weigh against them. But those facts in the bible which contradict the laws of nature, must be examined with more care, and under a variety of faces. Here you must recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from god. Examine upon what evidence his pretensions are founded, and whether that evidence is so strong as that it’s falshood would be more improbable than a change of the laws of nature in the case he relates For example in the book of Joshua we are told the sun stood still several hours. Were we to read that fact in Livy or Tacitus we should class it with their showers of blood, speaking of statues, beasts &amp;c., but it is said that the writer of that book was inspired. Examine therefore candidly what evidence there is of his having been inspired. The pretension is entitled to your enquiry, because millions believe it. On the other hand you are Astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature that a body revolving on it’s axis, as the earth does, should have stopped, should not by that sudden stoppage have prostrated animals, trees, buildings, and should after a certain time have resumed it’s revolution, and that without a second general prostration. Is this arrest of the earth’s motion, or the evidence which affirms it, most within the law of probabilities? You will next read the new testament. It is the history of a personage called Jesus. Keep in your eye the opposite pretensions. 1. Of those who say he was begotten by god, born of a virgin, suspended and reversed the laws of nature at will, and ascended bodily into heaven: and 2. of those who say he was a man, of illegitimate birth, of a benevolent heart, enthusiastic mind, who set out without pretensions to divinity, ended in believing them, and was punished capitally for sedition by being gibbeted according to the Roman law which punished the first commission of that offence by whipping, and the second by exile or death in furcâ. See this law in the Digest Lib. 48. tit. 19 § 28. 3. and Lipsius Lib. 2. de cruce. cap. 2. These questions are examined in the books I have mentioned under the head of religion, and several others. They will assist you in your enquiries, but keep your reason firmly on the watch in reading them all. Do not be frightened from this enquiry by any fear of it’s consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no god, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in it’s exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you. If you find reason to believe there is a god, a consciousness that you are acting under his eye, and that he approves you, will be a vast additional incitement. If that there be a future state, the hope  of a happy existence in that increases the appetite to deserve it; if that Jesus was also a god, you will be comforted by a belief of his aid and love. In fine, I repeat that you must lay aside all prejudice on both sides, and neither believe nor reject any thing because any other person, or description of persons have rejected or believed it. Your own reason is the only oracle given you by heaven, and you are answerable not for the rightness but uprightness of the decision.—I forgot to observe when speaking of the New testament that you should read all the histories of Christ, as well of those whom a council of ecclesiastics have decided for us to be Pseudo-evangelists, as those they named Evangelists, because these Pseudo-evangelists pretended to inspiration as much as the others, and you are to judge their pretensions by your own reason, and not by the reason of those ecclesiastics. Most of these are lost. There are some however still extant, collected by Fabricius which I will endeavor to get and send you.  
5. Travelling. This makes men wiser, but less happy. When men of sober age travel, they gather knowlege which they may apply usefully for their country, but they are subject ever after to recollections mixed with regret, their affections are weakened by being extended over more objects, and they learn new habits which cannot be gratified when they return home. Young men who travel are exposed to all these inconveniences in a higher degree, to others still more serious, and do not acquire that wisdom for which a previous foundation is requisite by repeated and just observations at home. The glare of pomp and pleasure is analogous to the motion of their blood, it absorbs all their affection and attention, they are torn from it as from the only good in this world, and return to their home as to a place of exile and condemnation. Their eyes are for ever turned back to the object they have lost, and it’s recollection poisons the residue of their lives. Their first and most delicate passions are hackneyed on unworthy objects here, and they carry home only the dregs, insufficient to make themselves or any body else happy. Add to this that a habit of idleness, an inability to apply themselves to business is acquired and renders them useless to themselves and their country. These observations are founded in experience. There is no place where your pursuit of knowlege will be so little obstructed by foreign objects as in your own country, nor any wherein the virtues of the heart will be less exposed to be weakened. Be good, be learned, and be industrious, and you will not want the aid of travelling to render you  precious to your country, dear to your friends, happy within yourself. I repeat my advice to take a great deal of exercise, and on foot. Health is the first requisite after morality. Write to me often and be assured of the interest I take in your success, as well as of the warmth of those sentiments of attachment with which I am, dear Peter, your affectionate friend,

“3. Moral Philosophy. 1 think it lost  
time to attend lectures on this branch.  
He who made us would have been a piti-  
ful bungler, if he had made the rules of  
our moral conduct a matter of science.  
For one man of science, there are thou-  
sands who are not. What would have  
become of them? Man was destined for  
society. His morality, therefore, was to  
be formed to this object. He was en-  
dowed with a sense of right and wrong,  
merely relative to this. This sense is as  
much a part of nature, as the sense of  
hearing, seeing, feeling; it is the true  
foundation of morality, and not the TO  
KAAON, truth, &amp;c. as fanciful writers  
have imagined. The moral sense, or con-  
science, is as much a part of man, as his  
leg orarm. It is given to all human be-  
ings in a stronger or weaker degree, as  
force of members is given them in a  
greater or less degree. It may be  
strengthened by exercise, as may any  
particular limb of the body This sense  
is submitted, indeed, in some degree, to  
the guidance of reason; but it is a small  
stock which is required for this: even a  
less one than what we call common sense.  
State a moral case to a ploughman and a  
professor. The former will decide it as  
well, and often better than the latter, be-  
cause he has not been led astray by artifi-  
cial rules. In this branch, therefore, read  
good books, because they will encourage,  
as well as direct your feelings. The  
writings of Sterne, particularly, form the  
best course of morality that ever was  
written. Besides these, read the books  
mentioned in the inclosed paper: and  
above all things, lose no occasion of exer-  
cising your dispositions to be grateful, to  
be generous, to be charitable, to be hu-  
mane, to be true, just, firm, orderly, cou-  
rageous, &amp;c. Consider every act of ‘this  
kind, as an exercise which will strengthen  
your moral faculties, and increase your  
worth.  
  
“4, Religion. Your reason is now mature  
  
  
  
  
Marcu,  
  
enough to examine this object. In the  
first place, divest yourself of all bias in  
favour of novelty and singularity of opi-  
nion. Indulge them in any other subject  
rather than that of religion. It is too im-  
portant, and the consequences of error  
may be too serious. On the other hand,  
shake off all the fears and servile preju-  
dices, under which weak minds are ser-  
vilely crouched. Fix reason firmlyin her  
seat, and call to her tribunal every fact,  
every opinion. Question with boldness  
even the existence of a God; because, if  
there be one, he must more approve the  
homage of reason, than that of blindfolded  
fear. You will naturally examine, first,  
the religion of your own country. Read  
the Bible then, as you would read Livy or  
Tacitus. The facts which are within the  
ordinary course of nature, you will be-  
lieve on the authority of the writer, as  
you do those of the same kind in Livy  
and Tacitus. The testimony of the writer  
weighs in their favour, in one scale, and  
their not being against the laws of na-  
ture, does not weigh against them. But  
those facts in the Bible which contradict  
the laws of nature, must be examined  
with more care, and under a variety of  
faces. Here you must recur to the pre-  
tensions of the writer to inspiration from  
God. Examine upon what evidence his  
pretensions are founded, and whether  
that evidence is so strong, as that its  
falsehood would be more improbable,  
than a change of the laws of nature, in  
the case he relates. For example, in the  
book of Joshua we are told, the sun stood  
still several hours. Were we to read that  
fact in Livy or Tacitus, we should class it  
with their showers of blood, speaking of  
statues, beasts, &amp;c. But it is said, that  
the writer of that book was inspired.  
Examine, therefore, candidly, what evi-  
dence there is of his having been in-  
spired. The pretension is entitled to  
your inquiry, because millions believe it.  
On the other hand, you are astronomer  
enough to know, how contrary it is to  
the law of nature, that a body revolving  
on its axis, as the earth does, should have  
stopped; should not, by that sudden stop-  
page, have prostrated animais, trees,  
  
uildings, and should after a certain time  
have resumed its revolution, and that  
without a second general prostration. Is  
this arrest of the earth’s motién, or the  
evidence which affirms it, most within the  
law of probabilities? You will next read  
the New Testament. It is the history of  
a personage called Jesus, Keep in your  
eye the opposite pretensions, 1. of those  
who say he was begotten by God, born of  
a virgin, suspended and reversed the laws  
of nature at will, and ascended bodily into  
heaven: and 2. of those who say he was

a man, of illegitimate birth, of a benevo-  
lent heart, enthusiastick mind, who set  
out without pretensions to divinity, ended  
in believing them, and was punished capi-  
tally for sedition, by being gibbeted, ac-  
cording to the Roman law, which punish-  
ed the first commission of that offence by  
whipping, and the*second by exile or  
death in furea. See this law in the Di-  
gest, Lib, 48. tit. 19. § 28. 3. and Lipsius,  
Lib. 2. de cruce, cap. 2, These questions  
are examined in the books I have men-  
tioned, under the head of Religion, and  
several others. They will assist you in  
your inquiries; but keep your reason  
firmly on the watch in reading them all.  
Do not be frightened from this inquiry by  
any fear of its consequences. If it ends  
in a belief that there is no God, you will  
find incitements to virtue in the comfort  
and pleasantness you feel in its exercise,  
and the love of others which it will pro-  
cure you. If you find reason to believe  
there is a God, a consciousness that you  
are acting under his eye, and that he ap-  
proves you, will be a vast additional in-  
citement: if that there be a future state,  
the hope of a happy existence in that, in-  
creases the appetite to deserve it: if that  
Jesus was also a God, you will be comfort-  
ed by a belief of his aid and love. - In fine,  
I repeat, you must lay aside all prejudice  
on both sides, and neither believe nor re-  
ject any thing, because any other person,  
or description of persons, have rejected  
or believed it. Your own reason is the  
only oracle given you by heaven, and you  
are answerable not for the rightness, but  
uprightness of the decision. I forgot to  
observe, when speaking of the New Tes-  
tament, that you should read all the histo-  
ries of Christ, as well of those whom a  
council of ecclesiasticks have decided for  
us, to be Pseudo-evangelists, as those they  
named Evangelists. Because these Pseudo-  
evangelists pretended to inspiration, as  
much as the others, and you are to judge  
their pretensions by your own reason, and  
not by the reason of those ecclesiasticks.  
Most of these are lost. There are some,  
however, still extant, collected by Fabri-  
cius, which I will endeavour to get and  
send you.”—Vol. IL. pp. 216—218.

&quot;Moral Philosophy--I think it lost time to attend ler­

there are thousand, who are not. What would have be

was endowed with a sense of riaht and wrong, taerely

true foundation of morality, and not the ro kalon, truth,

or conscience, is as much a part of man as his leg or arm.  
It is given to all human beings in a stronger or weaker

less degree. It may be strengthened by exercise, as may  
any particular limb of the body. This sense is submits

RELIGION. — Your reason is now mature enough to examine this  
subject. In the first place, divest yourself of all bias in favor of novelty  
and singularity of opinion. Indulge them in any other subject rather  
than that of religion. It is too important, and the consequences of  
error may be tvo serious. On the other hand, shake off all the fears  
and servile prejudices under which weak minds are servilely crouched.  
Fix reason firmly in her seat ; and call to her tribunal every fact, every  
opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; be-  
cause, if there be one, he must more approve the homage of reason  
than that of blindfolded fear. You will naturally examine, first, the  
religion of your own country. Read the Bible, then, as you would  
read Livy or Tacitus. The facts which are within the ordinary course  
of nature you will believe on the authority of the writer, as you-do  
those of the same kind in Livy and Tacitus. The testimony of the  
writer weighs in their favor in one scale, and their not being against  
the laws of nature does not weigh against them. But those facts in  
the Bible which contradict the laws of nature must be examined with  
more care, and under a variety of faces. Here you must recur to the  
pretensions of the writer to inspiration from God. Examine upon what  
evidence his pretensions are founded, and whether that evidence is so  
strong as that its falsehood would be more improbable than a change  
of the laws of nature in the case he relates. For example, in the book  
of Joshua we are told the sun stood still several hours. Were we to  
read that fact in Livy or Tacitus, we should class it with their showers  
of blood, speaking of statues, beasts, etc. But it is said that the writer  
of that book was inspired. Examine, therefore, candidly, what evidence  
there is of his having been inspired. The pretension is entitled to your  
inquiry, because millions believe it. On the other hand, you are  
astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the laws of nature  
that a body revolving on its axis, as the earth does, should have  
stopped ; should not by that sudden stoppage have prostrated animals,  
trees, buildings ; and should after a certain time have resumed its revo-

lution, and that without a second general prostration. Is this arrest of  
the earth’s motion, or the evidence which affirms it, most within the  
laws of probabilities? You will next read the New Testament. It is  
the history of a personage called Jesus. Keep in your eye the oppo-  
site, — pretensions, first, of those who say he was begotten by God, born  
of a virgin, suspended and reversed the laws of nature at will, and  
ascended bodily into heaven ; and, second, of those who say he was a  
man of illegitimate birth, of a benevolent heart, enthusiastic mind, who  
set out without pretensions to divinity, ended in believing them, and  
was punished capitally ior sedition, by being gibbeted, according to the  
Roman law, which punished the first commission of that offense by  
whipping, and the second bv exile or death i furea. See this law in  
the Digest, Lib. 48, tit. 19, § 28, 3 ; and Lipsius Lib. 2, de cruce. cap. 2.  
These questions are examined in the books I have mentioned, under  
the head of religion, and several others. They will assist you in your  
inquiries ; but keep your reason firmly on the watch in reading them  
all. Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its conse-  
quences. If it enc in a belief that there is no God, you will find incite-  
ments to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise,  
and the love of others which it will procure you. If you find reason  
to believe there is a God, a consciousness that you are acting under his  
eye, and that he approves you, will be a vast additional incitement ; if  
that there be a future state, the hope of a happy existence in that in-  
creases the appetite to deserve it; if that Jesus was also a God, you  
will be comforted by a belief of his aid and love. In fine, I repeat,  
you must lay aside all prejudice on both sides, and neither believe nor  
reject anything because any other person, or description of persons,  
have rejected or believed it. Your own reason is the only oracle given  
you by Heaven ; and you are answerable, not for the rightness, but up-  
rightness of the decision. I forgot to observe, when speaking of the  
New Testament, that you should read all the histories of Christ, as well  
of those of whom a council of ecclesiastics have decided for us to be  
pseudo-evangelists, as those they named evangelists. Because those  
pseudo-evangelists pretended to inspiration, as much as the others,  
and you are to judge their pretensions by your own reason, and  
not by the reason of those ecclesiastics. Most of these are lost. There  
are some, however, still extant, collected by Fabricius, which I will  
endeavor to get and send you.

the Bible as you would Livy or Tacitus  
In the book of Joshua we are told the sun  
stood still several hours. It is said the writer of  
the book was inspired. The pretension is entitled to  
your inquiry because millions believe it. On the other  
land, how contrary it is to the law of nature that a body  
revolving on its axis, as the earth does, should have  
stopped, shouid not have prostrated animals, tree  
buildings, and should, after a certain time, have  
resumed its revolution, and that without a second  
general prostration. You will next read the New Testa  
ment. It is the history of a person called Jesus. Kcep  
in your eye the opposite pretensions (1) of those who say  
he was begotten by God, born of a virgin, suspended and  
reversed the laws of Nature at will, and ascended bodily  
into heaven; and () of those who say he was a man of  
illegitimate birth, of a benevolent heart, enthusiastic  
mind, who set out without pretensions to divinity  
ended in believidg them, and was punished capitally  
by being gibbeted according to Roman law. Do not be  
frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its conse  
quences. If it ends in a behef that there is no God, you  
will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleas

If these are not infidel views, then infidelity was never

Paris, Aug. lO.  
Dear Peter I have received your two letters  
of Dec. 30 and April 18. and am happy to find by  
them, as well as by letters from Mr. Wythe,  
that you have been so fortunate as to attract his  
notice and good will. I am sure you will find  
this to be one of the most fortunate incidents of  
your life, as I have been sensible it was of mine. I  
inclose you a sketch of the sciences to which I  
wish you to apply, in such order as &quot;Mr. Wythe  
shall advise. I mention also the books in them  
worth your reading, which submit to his cor­  
rection many of them are among your father&#x27;s  
books, which you should have brought with you.  
As I do not recollect those of them not in his  
library, you must write to ma for them, making  
out a catalogue of such as you think you shall  
have occasion for in eighteen months from the  
date of your letter and consulting Mr. Wythe on  
the subject. To this sketch I will add a few  
particular observations.  
1. Italian. I fear that the learning of this  
language will confound your French and Span­  
ish. Being all of them degenerate dialects of  
the Latin they are apt to mix in conversation.  
I have never seen a person speaking the three  
languages who did not mix them. It is a de­  
lightful language, but late events have rendered  
the Spanish more useful; lay it aside to prose­  
cute that.  
2. Spanish. Bestow great attention on this  
and endeavor to acquire an accurate knowledge  
of it Our future connections with Spain and  
Spanish America will render that language a  
valuable acquisition. The ancient history of a  
great part of America, too, is written in that  
languace. I send you a dictionary.  
3. Moral philosophy, X think it lost time to  
  
attend lectures of this branch. He who made us  
would have been a pitiful bungler if He had  
made the rule of our moral conduct a matter of  
science. For one man of science there are  
thousands who are not What would have be­  
come of them? Man was destined for society.  
His morality, therefore, was to be formed to this  
object. He was endowed with the sense of right  
and wrong merely relative to this Bense. This  
sense is as much a part of his nature as the sense  
of hearing, seeing, feeling; it is the true founda­  
tion of moral it J-, and not the gonfalan, truth,  
etc, as. fanciful writers have imagined. The  
moral sense or conscience is as much a part cf  
man as his leg or arm. It is given to ail human  
beings in a stronger or weaker degree,  
as force of members is given in greater of  
less degree. It may be strengthened  
by exercise, as may any particular  
limb of the body. This science is submitted in  
some degree to the guidance of reason, but it is a  
small stock which is required for this, even a  
less one than what we call common sense. State  
a moral case to a plowman and a professor. The  
former will decide it as well, and often better,  
than the latter, because he has not been led  
astray by artificial rulss. In this branch, there­  
fore, read books, because they will encourage  
as well as direct your feelings. The writings of  
Sterne, particularly, form the best course of  
morality that ever was written. Besides these,  
read the books mentioned in the indorsed paper,  
and, above all things, lose no occasion of exer­  
cising your disposition to be grateful, to be gen­  
erous, to be charitable, to be true, just, firm, or­  
derly, courageous, etc Consider every act of  
this kind as an act which will strengthen your  
moral faculties and increase your worth.  
4. Religion. - Your reason is now mature  
enough to examine this object. In the &#x27;first  
place divest yourself entirely of all bias in favor  
of novelty or singularity of opinion. Indulge  
them in any other subject rather than that of  
religion. It is too important and the conse­  
quences of error may be too serious. On the  
other hand, shake off all fear and servile preju­  
dices under which weak minds are servilely  
crouched. Fix reason firm in her seat and call  
to her tribunal every fact, every opinion.  
Question with boldness the very existence of a  
God; because, if there be one. He must more ap­  
prove the homage of reason than that of blind­  
folded fear. You will naturally examine first  
the relieion of your own country. Read your  
Bible, then, as you would read Livy or Tacitus.  
Facts which are in the ordinary course of nature  
you will believe on the authority -of the  
writer as you do those of the same kind in  
Livy and Tacitus. The testimony of the  
writer weighs in their favor in one scale, and  
these, not being against the laws of nature, do  
not weigh agaiust them. But those facts in the  
Bible which contradict the laws of nature must  
be examined with more care and under a variety  
of phases. Here you must reour to pretensions of  
the writer to inspiration from God. Examine  
upon what evidence his pretensions are founded,  
and whether that evidence is so strong that its  
falsehood would be more improbable than a  
change of the laws of nature in the case be re­  
lates. For example, in the book of Joshua we  
are told the sun stood still several hours.  
Were we to read that fact in Livy or  
Tactions we should class it with their  
showers of blood, speaking statues, beasts, etc.  
But.it is said that the writer of that book was  
inspired. Examine, therefore, candidly, what  
evidence there is of his having been inspired.  
The pretension is entitled to your inquiry be­  
cause millions believe it. On the other hand,  
you are astronomer enough to know how con­  
trary it is to the law of nature that a body re­  
volving on its axis, as the earth does, should have  
stopped, should not, by that sudden stoppage,  
have prostrated animals, trees, buildings, and  
should, after a certain time, have resumed its  
revolution and that without a second general  
prostration. Is this arrest of the earth&#x27;s motion,  
or the evidence which affirms it, most within the  
law of probabilities?  
You will next read the New Testament. It  
is the history of a personage called Jesus.  
KeeD in your eye the opposite pretensions; first,  
of those who say he was begotten by God, born  
of a virgin, suspended and reversed the laws of  
nature at will, and ascended bodily into heaven;  
and second, of those who say he was a man of  
illegitimate birth, of a benevolent heart, enthu­  
siastic mind, who set out with pretensions to  
divinity, ended in believing them aud was pun­  
ished capitally for sedition by being gibbeted  
according to the Roman law, which punished the  
first commission of that offense by whipping and  
the second by exile or death in funca. See this  
law in the digest. Lib. 48, Tit. 19, Sec. 28, 3.  
and Lipsius, Lib. 2. De Cruce cap. 0.  
These questions are examined in the  
book I bad mentioned under the head of re­  
ligion and several others. They will assist you  
in your inquiries; but keep your reason firmly  
on the watch in reading them all. Do not be  
frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its  
consequences. If it ends in the belief that there  
is no God you will find incitement to virtue in the  
comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exer­  
cise, and the love of others which it will procure  
you. If you find reason to believe there is a  
God, a consciousness that you are acting under  
His eye and that He approves you will be a vast  
additional incitement ; if there be a future state,  
the hope of a bappy existence in that increases  
the appetite to deserve it: if that Jesus was  
also a God you will be comforted by a  
belief of His aid aud love. In fine, I  
repeat, you must lay aside all prejudice  
on both sides, and neither be­  
lieve nor reject anything because any  
other person or description of persons have re­  
jected or believed it. Your own reason is the  
only oracle given by heaven, and you are an­  
swerable, not for the Tightness, but for tn up­  
rightness of the decision. I forgot to observe,  
when speaking of the New Testament, that you  
should read all the histories of Christ as well as  
those whom a council of ecclesiastics have de­  
cided for us to be pseudo-evangelists as those  
they named evangelist, because those pseudo­  
evangelists pretend to inspiration as much as the  
others, and you are to judge of their pretensions  
by your own reason, and not by the reason of  
those ecclesiastics. Most of these are lost. There  
are some, however, still extant, collected by  
Fabricius, which I will endeavor to get and send  
you.  
5. Traveling This makes men wiser, but less  
happy. When men of sober age travel they  
gather knowledge which they may apply useful­  
ly for their country, but they are, after all, sub­  
ject to recollections mixed with regret; their af­  
fections are weakened by being extended over  
more objects, and they learn new habits which  
cannot be gratified when they return home.  
Young men who travel are exposed to all these  
inconveniences in a higher degree to others more  
serious, and do not acquire that wisdom for  
which a previous foundation is requisite by re­  
peated and just observations at home. The glare  
of pomp and pleasure is analagous to the motion  
of the blood; it absorbs all their affections and  
attention; they are torn from it, as from the only  
good in this world, and return to their home  
as to a place of exile and condemna­  
tion. Their eyes are ever turned back  
to the object they have lost, and its recollection  
poisons the residue of their lives. Their first  
and most delicate passions are hackneyed on un­  
worthy objects here, and tbey carry home the  
dregs insufficient to make themselves or any­  
body else happy. Add to this that a habit of  
idleness, and inability to apply themselves to  
business, is acquired aud renders them useless  
to themselves and their country. These obser­  
vations are founded in experience. There is no  
place where your pursuit of knowledge will be  
so little obstructed by foreign objects as in  
your own country, nor any wherein the virtues  
of the heart will be less exposed to be weakened.  
Be good, be learned and be industrious, and  
you will not want the aid of traveling to render  
you precious to your country, dear to your  
friends, happy within yourself. I repeat my ad­  
vice to take a great deal of exercise, and on foot  
Health is the first requisite for morality. Write  
to me oftener and be assured of the interest I  
take in your success, as well as the warmth of  
those sentiments of attachment with which I  
am, dear Peter, your affeotionate friend.  
Tn. Jefferson.

PAIUS , August 10,1787.  
Dear Peter I have received your two  
letters of December 80 and April 18 , and  
am happy to find by them , as well as by  
letters from Mr. Wytho that you have  
been so fortunate as to attract his notice  
and good will. I am sure you will llnd  
, his to bo ono of the most fortunate Inci­  
dents of your llfo.as I have been sensible  
t was of mine. I enclose you a sketch  
of the sciences to which I wish you to  
apply , In such order as Mr. Wytho shall  
advise. 1 mention also the books In  
; hem worth your reading , which submit  
: o his correction many of them are  
among your father&#x27;s books which you  
should have brought to you. As I do  
not recollect those of them not in his  
library you niucf write to mo for them ,  
making out a catalogue of such as you  
think you shall have occasion for In  
eighteen months from the date of your  
letter and consulting Mr. Wytho on the  
subject. To this sketch I will add a few  
particular observations.  
First , Italian. I fear that the learning  
of this laneuago will confound your  
French and Spanish. Being all of them  
degenerate dialects of the Latin , they are  
apt to mix in conversation. I have never  
scon a person speaking the throe lan­  
guages who did not mix them. It is a  
delightful language , but late events have  
rendered the Spanish moro useful ; lay it  
aside to prosecute that.  
Second , Spanish. Bestow great atten­  
tion on this and endeavor to ticquiro an  
accurate knowledge of it. Our future  
connections with Spain and Spanish  
America will render that language a val­  
uable acquisition. The ancient history of  
a great part of America , too , is written in  
that language. I send you a dictionary.  
MOKEL SENSE INBOKN.  
Third Moral philosophy. I think it  
lost time to attend lectures on this  
branch. He who made us would have  
boon a pitiful bungler if Ho made the  
rule of our moral conduct a matter of  
science. For ono man of science there  
are thousands who are not. What would  
have become of them ? Man was des­  
tined for society. His morality , there­  
fore , was to be formed to this object. He  
was endowed with a sense of right and  
wrong merely relative to this senso. This  
sense is as much a part of his nature as  
the sense of , hearing , seeing , fooling ; it is  
the true foundation .of morality. The  
moral sense&#x27;or conscience is as much a­  
part of man as his leg or arm. It is  
given to till human beings in a stronger  
or weaker degree , as force of members  
is given in a greater or less degree. It  
may bo strengthened by exercise , as may  
any particular limb of the body. This  
Hoimicu is submitted-in-som&amp;dcgroo-to  
the guidance of reason , but it is a small  
stock which is required for this ; oven a  
less ono than what wo call common senso.  
State a moral case to a ploughman and a  
professor. The former will decide it as  
well , and often better than tie ( latter , because-  
cause no has not been led estray by arti­  
ficial rules. In this branch , therefore ,  
road books because they will encourage  
as well as direct your feelings. The  
writings of Stcrno , praticularly , form the  
the best course of morality that over was  
written. Beside these , read the books  
mentioned in the indorsed paper , and ,  
above all things , lose no occasion of ex­  
orcising your disposition to bo grateful , to  
be generous , to be charitable , to be true ,  
just , linn , orderly , courageous , etc. Con­  
sider every act of this Kind as an act  
which will strengthen your moral facul­  
ties and increase your worth.  
CAUTIONS ABOUT RELIGION.  
Fourth Ilelicion. Your reason is now  
raaturn enough to examine this object.  
In the first place divest yourself entirely  
of all basis in favor of novelty or singu­  
larity of opinion. Indulge them in any  
other subject rather than thai of religion.  
It is too important , and the consequences  
of error may bo too serious. On the  
otho&#x27;r hand , shako off all fear and servile  
prejudices under which weak minds are  
servilely crouched. Fix reason lirm , in  
her seat and call to her tribunal every  
fact , every opinion. Question with bold­  
ness the very existence of God ; because  
if there bo one , Ho must more approve  
the homage of reason than that of blind­  
folded fear. You will naturally examine  
first the religion of yourfown country.  
Huad your bible , then , as you would road  
Llvy or Tacitus. The facts which arc in  
the ordinary course of nature you will  
believe on the authority of the writer as  
you do those of the same kind in Livy  
and Tacitus. The testimony of the  
writer weighs in their favor in  
ono scale , and these , not being against  
the laws of naturedocs not weigh against  
them. But those facts in the bible  
which contradict the laws of nature must  
bo examined with moro care anil under a  
variety of faces. Hero you must recur  
to pretensions of the writer to inspiration  
from ( iod. Examine upon what evidence  
his pretensions are founded , and wlmthcr  
that evidence is so strong that its false­  
hood would be moro improbable than a  
change of the laws of nature in the case  
ho relates. For example , in the book of  
Joshua wo are tokl&#x27;tho sun stood still  
several hours. Wore wo to road that fact  
in Livy or Tacitus wo should class it with  
their showers of blood , speaking statues ,  
boasts , etc. But it is said that the writer  
of that book was inspired. Examine ,  
tkwroforo , candidly , what evidence there  
is of his having been inspired. The pretension -  
tension is entitled to your inquiry because  
millions behevo it. On the other hand ,  
vou are astronomer enough to know how  
contrary it is to the laws of nature , that  
a body revolving on its axis , as the earth  
docs , should have stopped , should not , by  
that sudden stoppage , have prostrated  
animals , trees , buildings , and should ,  
after a certain timo. have resumed its  
revolution and that without a second gen­  
eral prostration. Is this arrest of the  
earth&#x27;s motion , or the evidence which  
alllrms it , most within the law of prob­  
abilities ?  
&quot;A I&#x27;KKSON&#x27;AGK GALLED JESUS. &quot;  
You will next read the Now Testament.  
It is the history of a personaco called  
Jesus. Keep in your eye the opposite  
pretension ; lirst , of these who say ho was  
bcgottan by God , born of a virgin , sus­  
pended and reversed the laws of nature  
at will , and ascended bodily into heaven ;  
and second of those who say ha was a  
man of illegitimate birthof u benevolent  
heart , enthusiastic mind , who set out  
without pretensions to divinity ended in  
believing them and was punished capi­  
tally for sedition by being glbbettod ac &lt;­  
cording to the Roman law , which pun­  
ished the first otlenso by whipping and  
the second by exile or death in tunca ,  
Hoe this law in the Digest , Lib. 48 , tit. 10 ,  
28 &gt; 3 , and Lipslus , Lib. 3. Do Cruco cap ,  
2. Those questions are examined in the  
book I bad mentioned under the head ol  
religion and several * others. They will  
assist you m your luquiucs ; but keep  
  
your reason firmly on the watch in read­  
ing thorn alL Do not bo frightened from  
this inquiry by any fear of the cense  
quences. If it ends in the belief thr.t  
there Is no God you will find Incitements  
to virtno In the comfort and pleasantness  
you feel In its exercise , and the love of  
others which it will procure you. If you  
tind reason to bcllcvo there is a God , a  
consciousness that you are acting under  
His cyo and that Ho approves you will bo­  
a vast additional incitement ; if there bo­  
A future statn , the hope of n happy exist-  
mco In that increase , the appetite to do-  
dorvo it ; if that Jesus was also a God  
you will bo comforted by a belief of His

lay aside all projudlco&#x27;oh both sides , and  
neither bcliovo or regret anything bo-  
jjauso any other porsorror description of

Your own reason is the only oracle given  
by hniivon , and you are answerable , not  
&#x27;or the riahtness , but for the uprightness  
jf the decision. I forgot to observe ,  
when speaking of the Now Testament ,

Fifth Traveling. Tills makes mun  
wiser but loss happy. When men of  
sober ago iravol they gather knowledge ,  
which they may apply usefully for their  
country , but they are after all subject to  
recollections mixed with regret ; their nf-  
Jcctions are weakened by being extended  
over moro objects , and they learn now  
habits which cannot bo gratified when  
they return homo. Young men who  
travel are exposed to all these inconve­  
niences in a higher degree to others moro  
serious , and do not acquire that wisdom  
for which a previous foundation is requi­  
site by repeated nnd just observations at  
&#x27;  
homo&#x27; . The glare of pomp andpleasure  
is analogous to the motion of the blood ;  
it absorbs all their affections nnd atten­  
tion ; they are torn from It , as from the  
only good in this world , and return to  
their homo as to a place of &quot;cxllo nnd con  
demnation. Their eyes arc over turned  
back to the object they have  
lost , and its recollection poisons  
the residue of their lives. Their  
first and most dulicato passions are hackneyed -  
noyod on unworthy objects hero , and  
they carry home the dregs insufllciont to  
make themselves or anybody else happy.  
Add to this that a habit of idleness and  
inability to apply themselves to business ,  
is acquired and renders them useless to  
themselves and their country. These  
observations are founded in experience.  
There is no place where your pursuit of  
knowledge will bo so Httlo obstructed by  
foreign objects as in your own country ,  
nor any wherein the virtues of the heart  
will be less exposed to be weakened.  
Bo good , bo learned nnd bo industri­  
ous and you will not want the aid of tra  
velling to render you precious to your  
country , dear to your friends , happy  
within yourself. I repeat my advice to  
take a great deal of exercise , and on foot.  
Health is the first requisite for morality.  
Write to mo often and bo assured , of the  
interest 1 take in your success , as  
well as the warmth of these sentiments  
of attachments with which I am , dear  
Peter , your affectionate friend ,

“Paris, Aug. 10.—Dear Peter: 1  
have received your two letters of  
December 30 and April 18, ami am  
happy to find by them, as well as by  
letters from Mr. Wythe, that you  
have been so fortunate as to attract  
bis notice and good will. I amjjtue  
you will find this to !&gt;•* one of the  
most fortunate accidents of your  
life, as 1 have been sensible it was  
of mine. 1 inclose you a sketch of  
the sciences to which I wish you to  
apply iu such order as Mr. Wythe  
| shall advise. I mention also the  
hooks in them worth your reading,  
which submit to his correction—  
many of them are among your fath­  
er&#x27;s hooks, which you should have  
brought with you. As I do not ic  
colicet those of them not in his libra­  
i rv, you must write to me for them,  
making out a catalogue of such as  
vou think you shall have occasion  
for iu eighteen months from the  
date of your letter and consulting  
Mr. Wythe on the subject. To this  
sketch I will add a few particular  
1 observations:  
“First—Italian. I fear that the  
i learning of this language will eou­  
: found your French and Spanish.  
Being ail of them degenerate dialects  
, of liic Latin, they are apt to mix in  
conversation. I have never seen a  
person speaking the three languages  
who did uot mix them. It is a de­  
lightful language, but late events  
have rendered the Spanish more use  
ful; lay it aside to prosecute that.  
“Second—Spanish. Bestow great  
attention on this and endeavor to  
acquire an accurate knowledgeol it.  
Our future connections with Spain  
ami Spauisii America will render  
, that language a valuable acqusilion.  
1 he ancient history of a great part  
of America, too, is written iu that  
language. I send you a dictionary.  
“Third—Moral philosophy. 1  
think it lost time to attend lectures  
of this braneli. lie who made us  
would have been a pitiful bungler if  
he bad made the rule of our moral  
conduct a matter of science. For  
one man of science, there arc thou­  
sands who are not. What would  
have become of them? Man was des­  
tined lor society. His morality,  
therefore, was to be formed to this  
1 object. He was endowed with the  
sense of right and wrong merely rel­  
, ative to this sense. This sense is  
  
as much a part ot Ins nature as the  
&#x27; sense of hearing, seeing, feeling; it  
is the true foundation of morality,  
aud not the gonfalon, truth, etc., as  
fanciful writers have imagined. The  
moral sense of conscience is as much  
a part of man as his arm or leg. It  
is given to ail human beings in a  
stronger or weaker degree, as force  
of members is given in greater or  
less degree. It may be strengthened  
by exercise, as may any particular  
limb of the body. This science is  
submitted in some degree to the  
guidance of reason, but it is a small  
stock which is required lor this,even  
a less one than what we call common  
sense. State a moral case to a plow­  
man and a professor. The forinci  
will decide it as well, and often bet­  
ter, because he has not been led  
astray by artificial rules. In this  
branch, therefore, read hooks, be­  
cause they will encourage as well as  
direct your feelings. The writings  
of Sterne, particularly, form the best  
course of morality that ever was  
written. Resides these, rea«h the  
books mentioned iu the indorsed  
paper, and. above ail things, lose no  
occasion of exercising your disposi  
lion to be grateful, to be generous,to  
be charitable, to lie true, just, firm,  
orderly, courageous, etc. Consider  
every act of this kind, as an act  
which will strengthen your moral  
faculties and increase your worth.  
“Fourth—Religion. Your reason  
is now mature enough to examine  
this object. In the first place, di­  
vest yourself of all bias in favor of  
novelty or singularity of opinion, in­  
dulge them iu any other subject  
rather than that of icligion. It is  
too important, and the consequences  
of error may be too serious. On the  
other hand, shake oil’ a;l tear aud  
servile prejudices.under which weak  
minds are servilely crouched. Fix  
reason firm in her seat and call to  
her tribunal every fact, every opin  
ion. Question with boldness the  
very existence of a God; because, if  
there be one, he must more approve j  
the homage of reason than that of  
blindfolded fear. You will naturally  
examine first the religion of your  
own country. Read your Rihie,then,  
as you would read Rivv or laeitus.  
  
Facts which are in the ordinary  
course of nature }’ou will believe on  
the authority of the writer as you do  
those of the same kind in Livy and  
Tacitus. The testimony of the wri­  
ter weighs iu their favor in one  
scale, and these, not beiug against  
Lite laws of nature, do not weigh  
against them. But those facts in  
the Bible which contradict the laws  
of nature must be examined with  
more care and under a variety of  
phases. Here you must recur to  
pretensions of the writer to inspira­  
tion from Giyl. Examine under  
what evidence his pretensions are  
founded, and whether that evidence  
is so strong that its falsehood would  
be more improbable than a change  
of the laws of nature in the case lie  
relates. For example, in the book  
of Joshua we are told the sun stood  
still several hours. Were we to read  
that fact in Livy or Tacitus we  
should class it with their showers  
of blood, speaking statues, beasts,  
etc. But it is said that the writer  
of that book was inspired. Exam­  
ine, therefore, candidly, what evi­  
dence there is of his having been in­  
spired. The pretension is entitled  
to your inquiry because millions  
believe it. On the other hand, you  
are astronomer enough to know how  
contrary it is to the law of nature  
that a body revolving on its axis, as  
the earth does, should have stopped,  
should not,by that sudden stoppage,  
have prostrated animals, trees,build­  
ing, and should, after a certain time,  
have resumed its revolution, and  
that without a second general pros­  
tration. Is this arrest of the earth’s  
motion; or the evidence which af­  
firms it, most within the law of  
I probabilities?  
  
“You will next road the New ies­  
j tament. It is the history of a per­  
sonage called Jesus. Keep your eye  
; on the opposite pretensions, first, of  
those who say he was begotten of  
God, born of a virgin, suspended  
and reversed the laws of nature at  
will, and ascended bodily into heav­  
en; and, second, of those who say  
he was a man of illegitimate birth,  
■ of a benevolent heart, enthusiastic  
mind, who set out with pretensions  
i to divinity, ended in believing them,  
; and was punished capitally for sc­  
I dition by being gibbeted according  
• to the Roman law, which punished  
! the first commission of that offense  
| by whipping and the second by ex­  
! ile or death in funcu. See this law  
in the digest, Lib. 4S, Tit. lb, Sec.  
28, 3, anil Lipsius, Lib. 2. I)e  
. t ruce. Cap. 0. These questions arc  
j examined in the book I had men­  
tioned under the head of religion  
and several others. They will as­  
sist you in your inquiries; but keep  
your reason firmly on the watch in  
reading them all. Do not be fright­  
1 eued from this inquiry by any fear  
1 of its consequences. If it ends in  
the belief that there is no God you  
will find incitement to virtue in the  
comfort and pleasantness you feel in  
; its exercise, and the love of others  
which it will procure you. It you  
find reason to believe there is a God,  
a consciousness that you are acting  
under His eye, and that He ap­  
proves you will be a vast additional  
: incitement; iftherebea future state,  
the hope of a happy existence in  
that increases the appetite to de  
serve it; if that Jesus was also a  
j God you will be comforted by a  
belief of His aid and love. In fine,  
1 repeat, you must lay aside all pre­  
judice on both sides, and neither  
believe nor reject anything, because  
any other person or description of  
persons have rejected or believed it.  
Your own reason is the only oracle  
given by heaven, and you are an­  
swerable, not for the rightness, but  
for the uprightness of the decision.  
I forgot to observe, when speaking  
of the New Testament, that you  
should read all the histories of  
Christ as well as those whom a  
council of ecclesiastics have decided  
for us to be pseudo evangelists as  
those they named evangelist, be­  
cause these pseudo-evangelists pre­  
tend to inspiration as much as the  
others, and you are to judge of their  
pretensions by your own reason, and  
not by the reason of those ecclesias­  
tics. Most of these are lost. There  
are some, however, still extant, col­  
lected by Fabricius, which I will  
endeavor to get and send you.  
  
“Fifth—Traveling. This makes  
men wiser, but less happy. When  
men of sober age travel they gather  
knowledge which they may apply  
usefully for their country, but they  
are, after all, subject to.recollec­  
tions mixed with regret; their af­  
fections arc weakened by being ex­  
tended over more objects, anti they  
learn new habits which cannot be  
gratified when they return home.  
Young men who travel are exposed  
to all these inconveniences- in a  
higher degree toothers more serious  
and do not acquire that wisdom for  
which a previous foundation is re­  
quisite by repeated and just obser­  
vations at home.  
The glare of pomp and pleasure is  
analogous to motion of the blood; it  
absorbs all their affections and at  
tentions; they are torn from it, as  
from the only good in this world,  
and return to their home as io a  
plaee of exile and condemnation.  
Their eyes are ever turned back to  
the object they have lost, and its rec­  
ollection poisons the residue of their  
lives. Their first and most delicate  
  
1 passions are hackneyed on unworthy  
■ objects here, and they carry home  
I the dregs ipsuffieientto make them­  
selves or anybody else happy. Add  
to this that a habit of ’(lioness, and  
inability to apply theqpselverf to bus­  
iness, is acquired and renders them  
useless to themselves and their  
&#x27; country. These observations are  
founded in experience. There is no  
place where your pursuit ot knowl­  
edge will be so little obstructed by  
j foreigu objects as in your own coun­  
try, nor any wherein the virtues of  
the heart will be less exposed to be  
weakened.  
‘•He good, be learned and be in­  
dustrious, and you will not want the  
aid of traveling to render you prec­  
ious to your country, dear to your  
friends, happy within yourself. I  
repeat my advice to take a great deal  
of exercise and on foot. Health is  
the first requisite of morality. Write  
to me oftener, and be assured of the  
interest I take in your success, as
