Mount Vernon Decr 15th 1773.  
  
The favourable account you was pleas’d to transmit me of Mr Custis’s conduct at College, gave me very great satisfaction; &amp; I hoped to have felt an increase of it by his continuance at that place under a Gentleman so capable of instructing him in every branch of useful knowledge, as you are: but these hopes are at an end; &amp; at length, I have yielded, contrary to my judgment, &amp; much against my wishes, to his quitting College; in order that he may enter soon into a new scene of Life, which I think he would be much fitter for some years hence, than now; but having his own inclination—the desires of his mother—&amp; the acquiescence of almost all his relatives, to encounter, I did not care, as he is the  
  
last of the family, to push my opposition too far; &amp; therefore have submitted to a Kind of necessity.  
Not knowing how his expences at College &amp;c. may stand, I shall be much obliged to you for rendering me an account of them. You will please to charge liberally for your own particular attention to Mr Custis; &amp; sufficiently reward the other Gentlemen who were engaged in the same good offices. If the money I left with you is insufficient to answer these purposes please to advise me thereof, &amp; I will remit the deficiency. I am very sorry it was not in my power to see you, whilst you were in these parts. I thank you very sincerely, Sir, for your polite regard to Mr Custis, during his abode at College, &amp; through you beg leave to offer my acknowledgments in like manner to the Professors &amp;c., &amp; with very great esteem &amp; regard, am Revd Sir, Your mot Obt humble Servt

erend Sir: The favorable account,  
which you were pleased to transmit to  
me, of Mr. Custis&#x27; good conduct at col­  
lege, gave me very great satisfaction.  
I hoped to have felt an Increase of it  
by his continuance at that place un­  
der a gentleman so capable of instruct­  
ing him in every branch of useful  
knowledge. But this hope is at an  
end, and it has been against my  
wishes that he should quit college in  
order that he may soon enter into a  
new scene of life for which he would  
be much fitter some years hence But  
having his own inclination, the deslre3  
of his mother and the acquiescence of  
almost all. his relatives to encounter,  
I did not care, as he Is the last of the  
family, to push my opposition too far,  
and I have therefore submitted to ft  
kind of necessity.  
&quot;Not knowing how his expenses at  
college stand I shall he much obliged  
if you will render me an account of  
them. You will please to charge lib­  
erally for your own particular atten­  
tion to Mr. Custis and sufficiently re­  
ward the other gentlemen who were  
engaged in the same good offices. If  
the money with you is insufficient to  
answer theso purposes, please to ad­  
vise me thereof and I will remit the  
deficiency.  
&quot;I am very sorry it was not in my  
power to see you whilst in these parts.  
I thank you very sincerely, sir, for  
your polite regard to Mr. Custis dur­  
ing his abode at college, and through  
you beg leave to offer my tcknowl­  
tdgments in like manner to the pro­  
lessors. Witi very great esteem and
