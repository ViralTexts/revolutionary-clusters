ncy, the Governor, to inform him that we have taken into our Consideration the joint Address of the two Houses of Parliament, his Majesty’s Answer, and the Resolution of the Commons which his Lordship has been pleased to lay before us. That wishing nothing so sincerely as the perpetual continuance of that brotherly love which we bear to our fellow subjects of Great Britain and still continuing to hope and believe that they do not approve the measures which have so long oppressed their brethren in America, we were pleased to receive his Lordship’s notification that a benevolent tender had at length been made by the british House of Commons towards bringing to a good end our  unhappy disputes with the Mother Country: that next to the possession of liberty, we should consider such Reconciliation the greatest of all human blessings. With these dispositions we entered into consideration of that Resolution: we examined it minutely; we viewed it in every point of light in which we were able to place it; and with pain and disappointment we must ultimately declare it only changes the form of oppression, without lightening its burthen. That we cannot close with the terms of that Resolution for these Reasons.  
Because the British Parliament has no right to intermeddle with the support of civil government in the Colonies. For us, not for them, has government been instituted here; agreeable to our Ideas provision has been made for such Officers as we think necessary for the administration of public affairs; and we cannot conceive that any other legislature has a right to prescribe either the number or pecuniary appointments of our Offices. As a proof that the Claim of Parliament to interfere in the necessary Provisions for support of civil Government is novel and of a late Date we take leave to refer to an Act of our Assembly passed so long since as the thirty second Year of the Reign of King Charles the second intituled An Act for raising a public Revenue and for the better support of the Government of this his Majesty’s Colony of Virginia. This Act was brought over by Lord Culpeper then Governor under the great Seal of England and was enacted in the name of the “King’s most excellent Majesty by and with the Consent of the General Assembly.”  
Because to render perpetual our exemption from an unjust taxation, we must saddle ourselves with a perpetual tax adequate to the expectations and subject to the disposal of Parliament alone. Whereas, we have right to give our money, as the Parliament does theirs, without coercion, from time to time, as public exigencies may require, we conceive that we alone are the judges of the condition, circumstances, and situation of our people, as the Parliament are of theirs. It is not merely the mode of raising, but the freedom of granting our Money for which we have contended. Without this we possess no check on the royal prerogative, and what must be much lamented by dutiful and loyal subjects, we should be stript of the only means, as well of recommending this Country to the favour of our most gracious Sovereign as of strengthening those bands of Amity with our fellow subjects which we would wish to remain indissoluble.  
Because on our undertaking to grant money as is proposed, the Commons only resolve to forbear levying pecuniary taxes on us;  still leaving unrepealed their several Acts passed for the purposes of restraining the trade and altering the form of Government of the Eastern Colonies; extending the boundaries and changing the Government and Religion of Quebec; enlarging the jurisdiction of the Courts of Admiralty, and taking from us the right of trial by jury; and transporting us into other Countries to be tried for criminal Offences. Standing armies too are still to be kept among us, and the other numerous grievancies of which ourselves and sister Colonies separately and by our representatives in General Congress have so often complained, are still to continue without redress.  
Because at the very time of requiring from us grants of Money they are making disposition to invade us with large Armaments by Sea and land, which is a stile of asking gifts not reconcileable to our freedom. They are also proceeding to a Repetition of injury by passing acts for restraining the commerce and fisheries of the Provinces of New England, and for prohibiting the Trade of the other Colonies with all parts of the world except the Islands of Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies. This seems to bespeak no intention to discontinue the exercise of this usurped Power over us in future.  
Because on our agreeing to contribute our proportion towards the common defence, they do not propose to lay open to us a free trade with all the world: whereas to us it appears just that those who bear equally the burthens of Government, should equally participate of it’s benefits. Either be content with the monopoly of our trade, which brings greater loss to us and benefit to them than the amount of our proportional contributions to the common defence; or, if the latter be preferred, relinquish the former, and do not propose, by holding both, to exact from us double contributions. Yet we would remind Government that on former emergencies when called upon as a free People, however cramped by this monopoly in our resources of wealth, we have liberally contributed to the common defence. Be assured then that we shall be generous in future as in past times, disdaining the shackles of proportion when called to our free station in the general system of the Empire.  
Because the proposition now made to us involves the interest of all the other Colonies. We are now represented in General Congress, by members approved by this House where our former Union it is hoped will be so strongly cemented that no partial Application can produce the slightest departure from the common Cause. We consider ourselves as bound in Honor as well as Interest to share one general Fate with our Sister Colonies, and should hold ourselves  base Deserters of that Union, to which we have acceded, were we to agree on any Measures distinct and apart from them.  
To observe that there was indeed a plan of accomodation offered in Parliament, which tho’ not entirely equal to the terms we had a right to ask, yet differed but in few Points from what the General Congress had held out. Had Parliament been disposed sincerely as we are to bring about a reconciliation, reasonable men had hoped that by meeting us on this ground something might have been done. Lord Chatham’s bill on the one part and the terms of the Congress on the other would have formed a basis for negotiation which a spirit of accomodation on both sides might perhaps have reconciled. It came recommended too from one whose successful experience in the art of Government should have ensured to it some attention from those to whom it was tendered. He had shown to the world that Great Britain with her Colonies, united firmly under a just and honest government, formed a power which might bid defiance to the most potent enemies. With a change of Ministers however a total change of measures took place; the component parts of the empire have from that moment been falling asunder, and a total annihilation of its weight in the political scale of the World seems justly to be apprehended.  
To declare that these are our sentiments on this important subject, which we offer only as an individual part of the whole empire. Final determination we leave to the General Congress now sitting, before whom we shall lay the Papers his Lordship has communicated to us. To their Wisdom we commit the improvement of this important advance; if it can be wrought into any good, we are assured they will do it. To them also we refer the discovery of that proper method of representing our well founded grievancies which his Lordship assures us will meet with the attention and regard so justly due to them. For ourselves, we have exhausted every mode of application which our invention could suggest as proper and promising. We have decently remonstrated with Parliament; they have added new injuries to the old: we have wearied our King with supplication, he has not deigned to answer us: We have appealed to the native honour and justice of the British nation; their efforts in our favour have been hitherto ineffectual. What then remains to be done? That we commit our injuries to the even-handed justice of that being who doth no wrong, earnestly beseeching him to illuminate the Councils and prosper the endeavors of those to whom America hath confided her hopes; that thro’ their wise  direction we may again see reunited the blessings of Liberty, Property, and Union with Great Britain

met in General Aſſembly, have taken into our conſideration the joint ad- ;  
dreſs of the two Houſes of Parliament, his Majeſty&#x27;s anſwer, and the reſolution  
of the Commons, which your Lordſhip has been pleaſed to lay before us.  
Wiſhing nothing ſo ſincerely as the perpetual continuance of that brotherly love  
which we bear to our fellow ſubjects of Great Britain, and ſtill continuing to  
hope and believe that they do not approve the meaſures, which have ſo long op-  
preſſed their brethren in America, we were pleaſed to receive your Lordſhip&#x27;s

it: and, with pain and diſappointment, we muſt ultimately declare, it only  
caanges the form of oppreſſion, without lightcning its burthens. We cannot  
  
zy Lord, cloſe with the terms of that reſolution, for theſe reaſons: &quot;254  
Becaule the Zr i7i// Parliament has no right to intermeddle with the ſupport of  
  
,  
  
  
inititated here. Agreeable to our ideas, proviſion has been made for ſuch offi-  
  
  
not conceive that any other legiſlature has a right to preſeribe either the number  
or pecuniary appointments of our ofiices. As a proof that the claim of Parlia-  
ment, to interfere in the neceſſary proviſions for ſupport of civil government, is  
novel, and of a late date, we take leave to refer to an act of our Aſſembly,  
pailed ſo long ſince as the zad year of the reign of King Charles II. entitled,  
Ai ad for raiſing a publick revenue, end for the better ſupport of the goverumeut. of  
this his Majeſty&#x27;s colony of Virginia. This act was brought over by Lord Culpeper,  
then Governour, under the great ſeal of Eng/and, and was enacted in the name  
of the King&#x27;s Moſt Excelieit Majeſty, by and with the confent of the General Aſſembly.  
  
Becauſe, to render perpetual our exemption from an unjuſt taxation, we  
  
  
money, as the Parliament do theirs, without coercion, from time to time, as  
1blick exigencies may require. We conceive, that We alone are the judges  
  
  
are of theirs. It is not merely the mode of raiſing, but the freedom of grant-  
ing, our money, for which we have contended. Without this, we poſſeſs no  
check on the royal prerogative; and, what muſt be lamented by dutiful and  
loyal ſubjects, we ſhould be ſtripped of the only means, as well of recom-  
mending this country to the favour of our moſt gracious ſovereign, as of  
ſtrengthening thoſe bands of amity with our fellow ſubjects, which we would  
wiſh to remain indiſſoluble. | b  
  
Becauſe, on our undertaking to grant money, as is propoſed, the Comm ons  
only reſolve to forbear levying pecuniary taxes on us, fti.1 um. unrepcaled  
their ſeveral acts paſſed for the purpoſes of reſtraining the trade and altering the  
Form of government of the eaſtern colonies; extending the 3 and  
changing the government and religion of Quebeck, enlarging the juriſdiction  
of the courts of admiralty, taking from us the right of trial by jury, and tranſ-  
porting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offences. Standing ar-  
mies, too, are ſtill to be kept among us; and the other numerous grievances,  
of which ourſelves, and ſiſter colonies, ſeparately, and by our repreſentatives,  
in General Congreſs, have ſo often complained, areſtill tocontinue without redreſs.  
  
Becauſe, at the very time of requiring from us grants of money, they are  
making diſpoſition to invade us with large armaments, by fea and land: which  
is a ſtyle of aſking gifts not reconcileable to our freedom. They are alſo pro-

ceeding to a repetition of injury, by paſſing acts for reſtraining the commerce  
and fiſheries of the provinces of New England, and for probibiting the trade of  
the other colonies with all parts of the world, except the iſla nds of Great Bri-  
rain, Ireland, and the Weſt Indies, This ſeems to bęſpeak no intention to diſcon-  
tinue the exerciſe of this uſurped power over us in future. |  
&#x27; Becauſe, on our agreeing to contribute our proportion towards the common  
defence, they do not propoſe to lay open to us a free trade with all the world;  
whereas, to us, it appears juſt that thoſe, who bear equally the burthens of  
government ſhould equally participate of its benefits. Either be contented  
with the monopoly of our LR which brings greater loſs to us, and benefit  
to them, than the amount of our proportional contributions to the common  
defence; or, if the latter be preferred, relinquiſh the former; and do not pro-  
propoſe, by holding both, to exact from us double contributions. &#x27; Yet we  
would remind government, that on former emergencies, when called upon as  
a {ree people, however cramped by this monopoly in our reſources of wealth,  
we have liberally contributed to the common defence. Be affured, then, that  
we ſhall be generous in future as in paſt times, diſdaining the ſhackles of pro-  
  
rtion, when called to our free ſtation in the general ſyſtem of the empire  
  
Becau +, the propoſition now made to us involves the intereſt of all the other  
colonies. We are now repreſented in General Congreſs, by members approved  
vy this Houſe, where our former union, it is hoped, will be ſo ftrengly cemented,  
t t no partial applications can produce the ſlighteſt departure from the common  
cauſe. We conſider ourſelves as bound in hononr, as well as intereſt, to ſhare  
one general fate with our ſiſter colonies; and ſhould hold ourſelves baſe deſer-  
ters, of that union to which we have acceded, were we to agree on any mea-  
ſures diſtinct and ↄpart from them. |  
  
There was indeed a plan of accommodation offered in Parliament; which,  
though not entirely equal to the terms we had a right to aſk, yet differed but  
in few points from what the General Congreſs had held out. Had Parliament  
been diſpoſed ſincerely, as we are, to bring about a reconciliation, reaſonable  
men had hoped, that, by meeting us on this ground, ſomething might have  
been done. Lord Chathan&#x27;s bill, on the one part, and the terms of the Con-  
greſs, on the other, would have formed a baſis for negotiation; which a ſpirit  
of accommodation, on both ſides, might perhaps have reconciled. It come  
recommended, too, from one whole ſucceſsful experience in the art of govern-  
ment ſhould have enſured to it ſome attention from thoſe to whom it was ten-  
dered. He had ſhewn to the world, that Great Britain, with her colonies,  
united firmly under a juſt and honeſt government, formed a power which  
might bid defiance to the moſt potent enemies. With a change of miniſters,  
however, a total change of meaſures took place: The component parts of the  
empire have, from that moment, been falling aſunder; and a total annihilation  
  
ol its weight, . in the political ſcale of the world, ſeems juſtly to be apprehended.  
  
&quot;x - TRY  
  
Theſe, my Lord, are our ſentiments on this important ſubject; which we  
offer, only, as an individual part of the whole empire. Final determination  
we leave to the General Congreſs, now fitting, before whom we ſhall lay the  
papers your Lordſhip has communicated to us. To their wiſdom we commit  
  
the improvement of this important advance. If it can be wrought into any  
good, we are aſſured they will do it. To them alſo we refer the diſcovery of  
that proper method of repreſenting our well-founded grievances, which, your  
Lordſhip aſſures us, will meet with the attention and regard+ſo juſtly due to  
them. For ourſelves, we have exhauſted every mode of application, which our  
invention could ſuggeſt, as proper and promiſing. We have decently remon-  
. ſtrated with Parliament; they have added new injuries to the old. We have  
wearied our King with ſupplications; he has not deigned to anſwer us. We  
have appealed to the native honour and juſtice of the Briri/h nation; their  
efforts, in our favour, have been hitherto ineffectual. What then remains to  
| be done? That we commit our injuries to the even-handed juſtice of that  
| BEING who doth no wrong; earneſtly beſeeching him to illuminate the  
| councils, and, proſper the endeavours, of thoſe to whom America hath confided  
  
her hopes; that, through their wiſe direction, we may again ſee, reunited,  
  
A the bleſſings of liberty and property, and the moſt permanent harmony with  
Great Britain. NP

we bear to our fellow-tubjects of Great-

teien of King Charles the Second, enti-  
tle , “ An aft foi railing a public reve~  
“ que, and for the better {upport of the  
« government of this his Majefty’s colo-  
« ny of Virginia,” Thisaét was brought  
over by Lord Culpeper, then Governor,  
under the great feal of England, and was  
enaéted in the name of the ‘ King’s  
 moft excellent Majefty, by and with  
&amp; the conient of the General Aflembly.”  
  
Becaule, to render perpetual our exemp-  
tion from an unjuit taxation, we muft  
faddle ourielves with a perpetual tax ade-  
quate to the expectations, and tubject  
to the difpofal of parliament alone.  
Whereas we have a right to give our  
money, as the parliament do theirs,  
without coertion, from time to time, as  
public exigencies may require. We  
conceive that we alone are the jucges  
of the condition, circumftances, and  
fituation of our people, as the parli-  
ament is of theirs. It is not meerly the  
mode of railing, but the freedom of grant-  
ing our money for which we contended.  
Without this we poflets no check on the  
royal prerogative; and, what mutt be  
lamented by dutiful and loyal fubjeéts,  
we fhould be ftript of the only means as  
well of recommending this country to  
the favours of our moft gracious Sove-  
seign, asof ftrengthening thofe bands of  
amity with vur tellow fubjeéts, which we  
would with to remain indiffoluble.  
  
Becaufe on our undertaking to grant  
money, as is propofed, the Commons  
only refolve to forbear levying pecuniary  
taxes on us: {till leaving unrepealed their  
feveral atts pafled for the purpofes of re-  
firaining the trade, and altering the form  
of government of the eaftern colonies; ex-  
tending the boundaries, and ehanging the  
government and religion of Quebec; en-  
larging the jurifiction of the courts of ad-  
miralty, taking from us the right of tri-  
al by jury, and tran{porting us into other  
countries tobe tried for criminal offences.  
Standing armies too are {till to b: kept  
among us, and the other numerous gricv-  
ances‘of which ourfelves and {iter colo-  
mies, feperately and by our reprefenta-  
tives in General Congrefs, have fo often  
complained, are ftili to continue without  
redrefs,  
  
Becaufe at the very time of requiring  
Fom us grants of money, they are ma-  
king difpofition to invade us with large  
ae by fea and land, which isa  
sg gifts not reconcileable to  
  
fom: They are alfo proceeding  
  
to repetition of injury by paffing aéts for  
ining the commerce and fifkeries of  
Provinces of New-England, gnd for  
  
  
  
prohibiting the trade of the other colo-  
nies with all parts of the world, except  
the iflands of Great-Britain, Ireland, and  
the Weft-Indies. This fcems to befpeak  
no intention todifcoutinue the exercite of  
this ufurped power over us in future.  
  
Becaufe on our agreeing to contribute  
our proportion towards the common de-  
fence, they do not propofe to lay open to  
us a free trade with all the world; where-  
as to us it appears but juft, that thofe  
who bear equally the burthens of govern-  
ment, ihouid equally participate of its  
benefits. Either be contented with the  
  
nonopoly of our trade. which brings  
greater Jofs tousand benefitto them, than  
the amount of our proportional contribu-  
tions to the common defence; or, if the  
latter be preferred, relingquith the former,  
and do not propofe, by holding both, to  
exact from us double contributions. Yet  
we would remind government, that, on  
former emergencies, when called upon  
as a free people, however cramped by this  
monopoly in our refources of wealth, we  
have liberally contributed to the common  
defence. Be affured then, that we thall  
be generous in future as in paft times,  
difdaining the fhackles of proportion,  
when called to our free ftation in the ge-  
neral fyftem of the empire.  
  
Becauie the propofition now made tous,  
involves the intereft of all the other cole-  
nies. Weare reprefented in General Con-  
grve{s by members approved by this houfe,  
where our former union it is hoped, will  
be fo ftrongly cemented that no partial  
applications can produce the flighteft de-  
parture from the common caufe.—We  
confider ourfelves as bound in honour, as  
well as intereft, to thare one general fate  
with our fitter colonies, and fhould hold  
ourfelves bafe deferters of that union, to  
which we have acceded, were we to agree  
on any meafures diftin€ and apart irom  
them.  
  
&quot;There was indeed a plan of accommo-  
dation offered im parliament, which,  
though not entirely equal to the terms  
we had aright to afk, yet differed but in

ment fhould have enfured to it fome at-  
tention from thofe to whom it was ten-  
dered.—He had fhewn to the world that  
Great-Britain, with her colonics, united  
firmly, under a juft and honeft govern-  
meat, formed a power which might bid  
defiance to the moft potent enemics.  
With a change of minifters, however, a  
total change of meafure took place: com-  
ponent parts of the empire have from  
that moment been falling afunder, and  
a total annihilation of its weight in the  
political fcale of the world, feenis juftly  
to be apprehended.  
  
Thefe, my Lord, are our fentiments  
‘on this impértant fubje&amp;t, which we of-  
fer only asan indtvidual part of the whole  
empire. Final determination we leave to  
the General Congrefs now fitting, before  
whom we fhall lay the papers your Lord-  
fhip has communicated tous. ‘To their  
wifdom we commit the improvement of  
this important advance; if it can be  
wrought into any good, we are aflured  
they will do it. To them alfo we refer  
the difcovery of that proper method of  
reprefenting our well founded grievances,  
which your Lordthip affures us will meet  
with the attention and regard fo juftly  
due to them. For ourfelves, we have ex-  
haufted every mode of application, which  
our inyention could fuggeft as proper and  
promifing. We have decently remon-  
{trated with parliament, they have add-  
ed few injuries to the old? we have wea-  
ried our King with fupplications, he has  
not deigned to anfwer us; we have ap-  
pealed to the native honour and juftice of  
the Britith nation, their efforts in our fa-  
vour have been hitherto ineffe@tual. What  
then remains to be done? ‘That we com-  
mit our injuries tothe even handed juftice  
of that Being who doth no wrong, eat-  
neftly befeeching him to illuminate the  
counfels, and profper the endeavours of

without coercion, from time to time, as public exigencies may ge-  
quire, We conceive, that we alone are the judges of the condition,  
circumſtances, and ſituation of our people, as the parliament are of

continue the exerciſe of this uſurped power over us in future.  
* Becauſe on our agreeing to contribute our proportion towards  
the common defence, they do not propoſe to lay open to us a free trade  
With all the world; whereas, to us it appears juſt, that thoſe who  
bear equally the burthens of government ſhould equally participate of its  
benefits. Either be contented with the monopoly of our trade, which  
brings greater loſs to us, and benefit to them, than the amount of our  
proportional contributions to the common defence; or, if the latter  
be preferred, relinquiſh the former; and do not propoſe, by holding  
both, to exact from us double contributions. Yet we would remind  
government, that on former emergencies, when called upon as a free  
people, however cramped by this monopoly, in our reſources of wealth,  
We have liberally contributed to the common defence. Be aſſured then,  
that we ſhall be generous in future as in paſt time, diſdaining the  
ſhackles of proportion, when called to our free ſtation in the general  
ſyſtem of the empire. Ws OT NE  
* Becauſe the propoſition now made to us involves the intereſt of  
all the other colonies. We are now repreſented in general congreſs  
by members approved of by this houſe ; where our former union, it is  
Hoped, will be ſo ſtrongly cemented, that no partial „ can  
pruduce the ſlighteſt departure from the common cauſe. We conſi-  
der ourſelves as bound in honour, as well as intereſt, to ſhare one  
general fate with our ſiſter colonies, and ſhould hold ourſelves baſe  
deſerters of that union to which we have acceded, were we to agree  
on any meaſures diſtin and apart from them. RE TN  
There was indeed a plan of accommodation, offered in parliament,  
which, though not entirely equal to the terms we had a right to aſk,  
yet differed but in a few points from what the general congreſs had  
held out. Had parliament been diſpoſed ſincerely, as ue ate, to bring  
ebout a reconciliation, reaſonable men had hoped, that by meeting us  
on this ground, ſomething might have been done. Lord Chatham&#x27;s  
bill, on the one hand, and the terms of the congreſs on the other,  
would have formed a baſis for negociation, which a ſpirit of accom-  
modation on both ſides, might perhaps have reconciled. It came  
recommended too, from one, whoſe fucce/5ful experience in the art of  
government, (ſhould have enſured to it ſome attentjon from thoſe to  
whom it was offered. He had ſhewn to the world, that Great Britain |  
with ber colonies, united firmly under a juſt and honeſt government,  
formed a power which might bid defiance to the moſt potent enemies.  
With a change of miniſters, however, a total change of meaſures  
took place. The component parts of the empire have, from that  
moment, been falling aſunder; and a total annihilation of its weight,  
in the political ſcale of the world, ſeems juſtly to be apprehended.  
« Theſe, my Lord, are our ſentiments on this important ſubject ;  
which we offer, only as an individual part of the whole empire. The  
final determination we leave to the general congreſs, now ſitting,  
before whom we ſhall lay the papers your Lordſhip has communicated  
to us. To their wiſdom we commit the improvementof this impor-  
tant advance. If it can be wrought into any good, we are aſſui
