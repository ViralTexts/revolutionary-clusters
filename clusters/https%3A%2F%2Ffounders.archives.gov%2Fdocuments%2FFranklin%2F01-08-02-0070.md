“This very Ground that is under me (Striking it with his foot) was my Land and Inheritance, and is taken from me by Fraud, when I say this Ground I mean all the Land lying between Tohiccon Creek and Wioming on the River Susquehanna;  
“All the Land extending from Tohiccon over the great Mountain to Wioming has been taken from me by Fraud for when I had agreed to Sell the Land to the Old Proprietary by the Course of the River, The Young Proprietarys came and got it run by a Streight Course by the Compass and by that means took in double the Quantity intended to be Sold.”

y the Lieut. Governor, the Speaker, and several Members of the Assembly and others with the Indians The said Delawarr King Teedyuscung on the 28th of that Month delivered himself as follows.  
“The Complaints I made last Fall, I yet continue. I think some Lands have been bought by the Proprietary, or his Agents, from Indians who had not a right to Sell, and to whom the Lands did not belong. I think also, when some Lands have been Sold to the proprietary by Indians who had a Right to Sell to a certain place, whether that purchase was to be Measured by Miles or Hours Walk, that the Proprietaries have, contrary to Agreement or Bargain taken in more Lands than they ought to have done, and Lands that belonged to others. I therefore now desire that you will produce the Writings and Deeds by which you hold the Land, and let them be read in Publick, and Examined, that it may be fully known from what Indians you have bought the Lands you hold, and how far your purchases extend, that Copies of the whole may be laid before King George and published to all the provinces under his Government. What is fairly bought and paid for I make no further Demands about: But if any Lands have been bought of Indians to whom these Lands did not belong, and who had no Right to sell them, I expect a satisfaction for these Lands. And if the Proprietaries have taken in more Lands than they bought of true Owners, I expect likewise to be paid for that. But as the persons to whom the Proprietaries may have Sold these Lands which of Right belonged to me, have made some Settlements, I do not want to disturb them, or to force them to leave them, but I expect a full Satisfaction shall be made to the true Owners for these Lands though the Proprietaries, as I said before, might have bought them from persons that had no right to Sell them.”
