Gentlemen of the Senate,February 9th 1790.   
Among the persons appointed during your late Session, to offices under the national Government, there were some who declined serving. Their names and offices are specified in the first column of the annexed list. I supplied these Vacancies, agreeably to the Constitution, by temporary appointments; which you will find mentioned in the second column of the list.
