non] Saturday Decr 14th 1799.  
  
This day being marked by an event which will be memorable in the History of America, and perhaps of the world, I shall give a particular statement of it, to which I was an eye witness.  
The last illness and Death of General Washington  
On thursday Decr 12th—the General rode out to his farms about ten o’clock, and did not return home ’till past three. Soon after he went out the weather became very bad, rain, hail and snow falling alternately with a cold wind: When he came in, I carried some letters to him to frank, intending to send them to the Post Office in the Evening. He franked the letters; but said the weather was too bad to send a servant to the Office that Evening. I observed to him that I was afraid he had got wet; he said no, his great coat had kept him dry; but his neck appeared to be wet and the snow was hanging upon his hair. He came to dinner (which had been waiting for him) without changing his dress. In the evening he appeared as well as usual.  
A heavy fall of snow took place on friday, which prevented the General from riding out as usual. He had taken cold (undoubtedly from being so much exposed the day before) and complained of a sore throat: he however went out in the afternoon into the ground between the House and the River to mark some trees which were to be cut down in the improvement of that spot. He had a Hoarseness, which increased in the evening; but he made light of it. In the evening the Papers were brought from the Post Office, and he sat in the parlour, with Mrs Washington &amp; myself reading them till about nine o’clock—when Mrs W. went up into Mrs Lewis’ room, who was confind in Child bed, and left the General &amp; myself reading the papers. He was very chearful, and when he met with anything interesting or entertaini[n]g, he read it aloud as well as his hoarseness would permit him. He requested me to read to him the debates of the Virginia Assembly on the election of a Senator and a Governor; and on hearing Mr Madison’s observations respecting Mr Monroe, he appeared much affected and spoke with some degree of asperity on the subject; which I endeavoured to moderate, as I always did on such occasions. On his  
  
retiring I observed to him that he had better take something to remove his cold; He answered no; “you know I never take anything for a Cold. Let it go as it came.”  
Between two &amp; three o’clock on Saturday Morning, he awoke Mrs Washington, and told her he was very unwell, and had had an ague. She observed that he could scarcely speak and breathed with difficulty; and would have got up to call a Servant; but he would not permit her lest she should take cold. As soon as the day appeared, the Woman (Caroline) went into the Room to make a fire, and Mrs Washington sent her immediately to call me. I got up, put on my clothes as quickly as possible and went to his Chamber. Mrs Washington was then up, and related to me his being taken ill as before stated. I found the General breathing with difficulty, and hardly able to utter a word intelligibly. He desired that Mr Rawlins (one of the Overseers) might be sent for to bleed him before the Doctor could arrive. I dispatched a Servant instantly for Rawlins, and another for Dr Craik, and returned again to the General’s Chamber, where I found him in the same situation as I had left him. A mixture of Molasses, Vinegar &amp; butter was prepared to try its effects in the throat; but he could not swallow a drop; whenever he attempted it he appeared to be distressed, convulsed and almost suffocated. Rawlins came in soon after sun rise, and prepared to bleed him. When the Arm was ready the General observing that Rawlins appeared to be agitated—said, as well as he could speak “Dont be afraid.” And after the incision was made, he observed “The orifice is not large enough.” However the blood ran pretty freely. Mrs Washington not knowing whether bleeding was proper or not in the General’s situation, begged that much might not be taken from him, lest it should be injurious, and desired me to stop it; but when I was about to untie the string, the General put up his hand to prevent it, and as soon as he could speak, said “more, more”! Mrs Washington being still very uneasy lest too much blood should be taken, it was stop’d after taking about half a pint. Finding that no relief was obtained from bleeding, and that nothing would go down the throat, I proposed bathing it externally with Salvilatila, which was done; and in the operation, which was with the hand, and in the gentlest manner, he observed “’tis very sore.” A pi[e]ce of flannel dip’d in salvilatila was put round his neck, and his feet bathed in warm water; but without affording any relief.  
  
In the mean time; before Dr Craik arrived, Mrs Washington desired me to send for Dr Brown of Port Tobacco, whom Dr Craik had recommended to be called, if any case should ever occur that was seriously alarming. I dispatchd a Messenger (Cyrus) immediately for Dr Brown (between 8 &amp; 9 o’clk). Dr Cra[i]k came in soon after, and upon examining the General, he put a blister of Cantharides on the Throat, took some more blood from him, and had a gargle of Vinegar, &amp; sage tea, and ordered some Vinegar &amp; hot water for him to inhale the steam, which he did; but in attempting to use the gargle he was almost suffocated. When the gargle came from his throat some ph[l]egm followed it, and he attempted to cough, which the Doctor encouraged him to do as much as possible; but he could only attempt it. About eleven o’clock Dr Craik requested that Dr Dick might be sent for, as he feared Dr Brown woud not come in time. A messenger was accordingly dispatched for him. About this time the General was bled again. No effect, however, was produced by it, and he remained in the same state, unable to swallow anything. A glister was administered about 12 o’clk, which produced an evacuation; but caused no alteration in his complaint.  
Doctor Dick came in about 3 o’clk, and Dr Brown arrived soon after. Upon Dr Dick’s seeing the General, and consulting a few minutes with Dr Craik, he was bled again; the blood came very slow, was thick, and did not produce any symptoms of fainting. Dr Brown came into the Chamber soon after; and upon feeling the General’s pulse &amp;c. the Physicians went out together. Dr Craik returned soon after. The Genl could now swallow a little. Calomil &amp; tarter em. were administered; but without any effect.  
About half past 4 o’clk he desired me to call Mrs Washington to his bed side, when he requested her to go down into his room, and take from his desk two Wills which she would find there, and bring them to him; which she did. Upon looking at them he gave her one, which he observed was useless, as being superseded by the other, and desired her to burn it; which she did, and took the other and put it into her closet.  
After this was done, I returned to his bed side and took his hand. He said to me, “I find I am going, my breathe cannot last long; I beleived from the first that the disorder would prove fatal. Do you arrange &amp; record all my late military letters and papers—arrange my accounts and settle my books, as you know more about them than any one else, and let  
  
Mr Rawlins finish recording my other letters which he has begun.” I told him this should be done. He then asked if I recollected anything which it was essential for him to do, as he had but a very short time to continue among us. I told him I could recollect nothing; but that I hoped he was not so near his end; he observed, smiling, that he certainly was, and that as it was the debt which must all pay, he looked to the event with perfect resignation.  
In the course of the afternoon, he appeard to be in great pain &amp; distress, from the difficulty of breathing, and frequently changd his posture in the bed. on these occasions I lay upon the bed &amp; endavourd to raise him, &amp; turn him with as much ease as possible. He appeared penetrated with gratitude for my attentions, &amp; often said, I am afraid I shall fatigue you too much; and upon my assuring him that I could feel nothing but a wish to give him ease; he replied “Well! it is a debt we must pay to each other, and I hope when you want aid of this kind you will find it.”  
He asked when Mr Lewis &amp; Washington Custis would return. (they were in New Kent.) I told him about the 20th of the month.  
About 5 o’clk Dr Craik came again into the Room &amp; upon going to the bed side, the Genl said to him, Doctor, I die hard; but I am not afraid to go, I beleived from my first attack, that I should not survive it; my breath cannot last long.  
The Doctor pressed his hand; but could not utter a word. He retired from the bed side &amp; sat by the fire absorbed in grief.  
Between 5 &amp; 6 o’clk Dr Dick &amp; Dr Brown came into the room, and with Dr Craik went to the bed; when Dr Craik asked him if he could sit up in the bed. He held out his hand &amp; I raised him up. He then said to the Physicians, “I feel myself going, I thank you for your attentions; but I pray you to take no more trouble about me, let me go off quietly; I cannot last long.” They found that all which had been done was without effect; he laid down again, and all retired, exceptg Dr Craik. He continued in the same situation, uneasy &amp; restless; but without complaining; frequently asking what hour it was. When I helped him to move at this time he did not speak; but looked at me with strong expressions of gratitude.  
About 8 oclk the Physicians came again into the room &amp; applied blisters and cataplasms of wheat bran to his legs &amp; feet; after which they went out (except Dr Craik) without a ray of hope.  
I went out about this time, and wrote a line to Mr Law &amp; Mr  
  
Peter, requesting them to come with their wives (Mrs Washingtons Granddaughters) as soon as possible to Mt Vernon.  
About ten o’clk he made several attempts to speak to me before he could effect it; at length he said, “I am just going! Have me decently buried; and do not let my body be put into the vault in less than three days after I am dead.” I bowed assent; for I could not speak. He then looked at me again and said, “Do you understand me?[”] I replied yes! “Tis well” said he.  
About ten minutes before he expired (which was between ten &amp; eleven o’clk) h[is] breathing became easier; he lay qu[i]etly; he withdrew his hand from mine, and felt his own pulse. I saw his countenance change. I spoke to Dr Craik, who sat by the fire; he came to the bed side. The General’s hand fell from his wrist—I took it in mine and put it into my bosom. Dr Craik put his hands over his Eyes and he expired without a struggle or a sigh!  
While we were fixed in silent grief, Mrs Washington (who was sitting at the foot of the bed) asked, with a firm &amp; collected voice, Is he gone? I could not speak; but held up my hand as a signal that he was no more. “Tis well, said she in the same voice, All is now over, I shall soon follow him! I have no more trials to pass through! [”]  
Occurrances not noted in the preceding Narattive.  
The General’s Servant Christopher was in the room through the day; and in the afternoon the General, directed him to sit down, as he had been standing almost the whole day. He did so.  
About 8 o’clk in the Morng he expressed a desire to get up. His Clothes were put on and he was led to a chair by the fire. He found no relief from that position, and lay down again about 10 o’clk.  
About 5 P.M. he was helped up again &amp; after sitting about half an hour desired to be undressed &amp; put in bed; which was done.  
During his whole illness he spoke but seldom, and with great difficulty and distress; and in so low &amp; broken a voice as at times hardly to be understood. His patience, fortitude and resignation never forsook him for a moment. In all his distress he uttered not a sigh nor a complaint; always endeavouring (from a sense of duty as it appeared) to take what was offered him, and to do as he was desired by the Physicians.  
At the time of his decease Dr Craik and myself were in the situation  
  
beforementioned; Mrs Washington was sitting near the foot of the bed. Christopher was standing by the bedside. Caroline, Molly &amp; Charlotte were in the room standing near the door. Mrs Forbes, the House Keeper, was frequently in the room during the day and evening.  
As soon as Dr Craik could speak, after the distressing scene was closed, he desired one of the Servants to ask the Gentln below to come up stairs. When they came to the bed side; I kissed the cold hand, which I had held to my bosom; laid it down &amp; went to the other end of the room; where I was for some time lost in profound grief; until aroused by Christopher desiri[n]g me to take care of the General’s keys and other things which were taken out of his pockets; and which Mrs Washington directed him to give to me. I wrapped them in the General’s handkerchief &amp; took them with me to my room.  
About 12 oclk the Corps was brought down stairs and laid out in the large Room

&quot; On Thursday, Dec&#x27;r. 12th, the General  
  
rode out to his farms at about 10 o&#x27;clock, and  
  
did not return home till 3. Soon after he went  
  
out, the weather became vary bad ; rain hail and  
snow falling alternately, with a celd wind  
  
When he came in, I carried some letters to him  
to frank, intending to send them to the Post Of­  
fice. He franked the letters, but said the wea­  
ther was too bad to send a servant to the office  
that evening. I observed to him that I was  
afraid he had got wet ; he said no his great­  
coat had kept him dry; but his neck appeared to  
be wet tho snow was hanging on his hair.  
He came to dinner without changing his dress.  
In the evening he appeared as well as usual. A  
heavy fall of snow took place en Friday, which  
prevented the Genoral from riding out as usual.  
  
lie has taken cold (undoubtedly tram being so  
much exposed the day before,) and complained  
  
of having a sore throat ; he hud a hoarseness,  
which increased in the evening, but he made light  
of it, as he would never take any thing to carry  
  
off a cold, always observing, &quot;let it go as  
  
came.&quot; In the evening, the papers having come  
from the Post Office, he sat in the room, with  
  
Mrs. Washington and myself, reading them, till

about nine o ciecu: anu wnen ne met wiui any  
  
thing which he thought diverting er interesting,  
  
he would read it aloud. He desired mete read  
  
to him tho debates of tho Virginia Assembly, on  
  
the election of a Senator and Governor, which  
  
did. On his retiring to .bed, he appeared to be  
  
in perfect health, except the cold which he con  
  
sidered as trifling he had been remarkably

her he was very unwell, and had an ague. &#x27; She  
observed that he could scarcely speak, and  
breathed with difficulty, and she wished to get  
  
up and call a servant; but the General would  
not permit her, lest she should tako cold.4 &#x27; As

she sat on his bed in silent grief, watching his part-

collected voice, “Is he gone?” When answered in

He thanked his physicians for their kindness,  
but assuring them that no efforts could be of any  
avail, entreated them to let him die quietly.  
On the night of the 14th, between the hours of  
ten and eleven, he gently expired in the sixty-  
eighth year of his age, and in the full possession  
of all his faculties. At the moment of death  
Mrs. Washington sat in silent grief at the foot  
of the bed.  
  
“Is he gone?” she asked, in a firm and collect-  
ed voice.  
  
The physician, unable to speak, gave a silent  
signal of assent.  
  
  
  
“°Tis well,” she added, in the same untrem-  
ulous utterance; “all is now over. I shall soon  
follow him. I have no more trials to pass  
through.”

were called in. Various remedies were tried, and ad-­  
ditior al bleeding, but all of no avail.  
&quot;About half-past four o clock writes Mr. Lear,  
&quot;he desired me to call Mrs. Washington to his bed­  
side, when he requested her to go down into his room  
and take from his desk two wills, which she would find  
there, and bring them to him, which she did. Upon  
looking at them, he gave her one, which he observed  
was uscless, as being superseded by the other, and de  
sired her to burn it, which she did, and took the other  
and put it into her closet,  
&quot;After this was done, I returned to his bedside and  
took bis hand. He said to me: &quot;I find I am going;  
my breath cannot last long. I believed from the first  
that the disorder would prove fatal. Do you arrange  
all my late military letters and papers. Arrange  
my accounts and seitle my books, as you know more  
abiont them than any one else; and let Mr. Rawling  
finish recording my other letters which he has begun.  
Itold him this would be done. He then asked if I  
recollected anwthing which it was cssential for him to  
do, as he had but a very short time to continne with  
.I told him that I could recollect nothing; but that  
T hoped he was not so near his end. He observed,  
en iling, that he certainly was, and that, as it was the  
debt which we must all pay, he looked to the event  
with perfect resignation.  
In the course of the afternoon he appeared to be in  
geat pain and distress from the difficulty of breath­  
ing, and frequently changed his posture in the bed.  
Mr. Lear endeavored to raise him and turn him with  
as much case as possible. &quot;I am afraid I fatigue you  
too much, the beneral would say. Upon being ase  
sured to the contrary, &quot;Well,&quot; observed he, gratefully,  
&quot;it is a debt we must pay to each other, and I hope  
when you want aid of this kind, you will find it.  
His servant, Christopher, had been in the room  
during the day, and almost the whole time on his feet.  
The General noticed it in the afternoon, and kindly told  
him to sit down.  
About five o clock his old friend, Dr. Craik, came  
again irto the room, and approached the bedeide.  
&quot;Doctor, said the General, &quot;I die hard, but I am  
net afraid to go. I believed, from my first attack,  
that I should not survive it--my breath cannot last  
long. The coctor pressed his hand in silence, retired  
from the bedside, and sat by the fire absorbed in  
grief.  
Between five and six the other physicians came in,  
and he was assisted to sit up in his bed. &quot;I feel I am  
going, said he, &quot;I thank you for your attentions,  
but I pray you to take no more trouble about me; let  
me go off quietly; I cannot last long.&quot; He lay down  
all retired except Dr. Craik. The General con

frequently asking what hour it was,

&quot;About ten o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes Mr. Lear, &quot;he made  
several attempts to speak to me before he could effect  
it. At length he said, &quot;I am just going. Have me  
decently buried, and do not let my body be put into the  
vault in less than three days after I am dead.&quot; I bowed  
assent, for I could not speak. He then looked at me  
again and said, &quot;Do you ur derstand me?&quot; I replied,  
&quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Tis well, said he.  
&quot;About ten minutes before he expired which was  
between ten and eleven o&#x27;clock) his breathing became  
easier. He lay quietly; he withdrew his hand from  
mine and felt his own pulse. I saw his countenance  
change. I spoke to Dr. Craik, who sat by the fire.  
He came to the bedside. The General&#x27;s hand fell from  
his wrist, I took it in mine and pressed it to my bosom.  
Dr. Craik put his hands over his eyes, and he expired  
without a struggle or a sigh.&quot;  
While we were fixed in silent grief, Mrs. Washing.­  
ton, who was seated at the foot of the bed, asked with  
a firm and collected voice, &quot;Is he gone!&quot; I could  
not speak, but held up my hand as a signal that he was  
no more. &quot;Tis well, said she in the same voice.  
&quot;All is now over; I shall soon follow him; I have no  
more trials to pass through.&quot;

snow, soon after hail, and then turned to a  
settled cold rain.&quot; Having on an overcoat,  
he continued his ride without regarding the  
weather, and did not return to the house un­  
til after 3.  
His secretary approached him with letters  
to be franked, that they might be taken to  
the Post Office in the evening. Washington  
franked the letters, but observed that the  
weather was too bad to send a servant out  
with them. Mr. Lear perceived that snow  
was hanging to his hair, and expressed fears  
that he had got wet; but he replied, No, his  
great coat had kept him dry.&quot; As dinner  
had been waiting for him, he sat down to  
the table without changing his dress. &quot;In  
the evening,&quot; writes his secretary, &quot;he ap­  
peared as well as usual.&quot;  
On the following morning the snow was  
three inches deep and still falling, which pre­  
vented him from taking his usual ride. He  
complained of a sore throat, and had evident­  
ly taken cold the day before. In the after­  
noon the weather cleared up, and he went out  
on the grounds between the house and the  
river, to mark some trees which were to be  
cut down. A hoarseness which had hung  
about him through the day grew worse to­  
ward night but he made light of it.  
He was very cheerful in the evening, as he  
sat in the parlor with Mrs. Washington and  
Mr. Lear, amusing himself with the papers  
which had been brought from the Post Office.  
When he met with anything interesting or  
entertaining, he would read it aloud as well  
as his hoarseness would permit, or he listened  
and made occasional comments, while Mr.  
Lear read the debates on the Virginia As­  
sen tbly etiring to bed, Mr. Lear, enggested  
that he should take something to relieve the  
cold. &quot;No,&quot; replied he, &quot;you know I never  
take anything for a cold. Let it go as it  
came.&quot;  
In the night he was taken extremely ill  
with ague and difficulty of breathing. Be­  
tween two and three o&#x27;clock in the morning,  
he awoke Mrs. Washington, who would have  
risen to call a servant, but he would not per­  
mit her, lest she should take cold. At day­  
break, when the servant woman entered to  
nake a fire she was sent to call Mr. Lear.  
He found the General breathing with diffi­  
culty, and hardly able to utter a word intelli­  
gibly. Washington desired that Dr. Craik,  
who lived in Alexandria, should be sent for,  
and that in the meantime Rawlins, one of the  
overseers, should be summoned, to bleed him  
before the doctor could arrive

A gargle was prepared for his throat, but  
whenever he attempted to swallow any of it,  
he was convulsed and almost suflocated.  
Rawlins made his appearance soon after sun­  
rise, but when the General&#x27;s arm was ready  
for the operation, became agitated. &quot;Don&#x27;t  
be afraid,&quot; said the General, as well as he  
could speak. Rawlins made an incision.  
&quot;The orifice is not large enough,&quot; said Wash­  
ington. The blood, however, ran pretty  
freely, and Mrs. Washington, uncertain  
whether the treatment was proper, and fear­  
ful that too much blood might be taken, beg­  
ged Mr. Lear to stop it. When he was  
about to untie the string the General put up  
his hand to prevent him, and as soon as he  
could speak murmured, &quot;more, more;&quot; but  
Mrs. Washing ton&#x27;s doubts prevailed, and the  
bleeding was stopped, after about half a pint  
of blood had been taken. External applica­  
tions were now made to the throat, and his  
feet were bathed in warm water, but without  
aflording any relief.

rious remedies were tried, and additional  
bleeding, but all of no avail.  
  
&quot;About half-past four o&#x27;clock&quot; writes Mr.  
Lear, &quot;he desired me to call Mrs. Washing­  
ton to his bedside, when he requested her to  
go down into his room and take from his desk  
two wills, which she would find there, and  
bring them to him, which she did. Upon  
looking at them, he gave her one, which he  
observed was useless, as being superceeded  
by the other, and desired her to burn it, which  
she did, and took the other and put it into  
her closet.  
&quot;After this was done, I turned to his bed­  
side and took his hand. He said to me: &quot;I  
find I am going; my breath cannot last long.  
I believed from the first that the disorder  
would prove fatal. Do you arrange all my  
late military letters and papers. Arrange  
my accounts and settle my books, as you  
know more about them than any one else;  
and let Mr. Rawlins finish recording my  
other letters which he has begun. I told  
him this would be done. He then asked if I  
recollected anything which was essential for  
him to do, as he had but a very short time to  
continue with us. I told him I could recol­  
lect nothing; but that I hoped he was not  
so near his end. He observed, smiling, that  
he certainly was, and that, as it was the debt  
which we must all pay, he looked to the event  
with perfect resignation.&quot;  
In the course of the afternoon he appeared  
to be in great pain and distress from the  
difficulty of breathing, and frequently chang­  
ed his posture in the bed. Mr. Lear endeav­  
ored to raise him and turn him with as much  
ease as possible. &quot;I am alraid I latigue  
you too much,&quot; the General would say.  
Upon being assured to the contrary, &quot;Well,&quot;  
observed he gratefully, &quot;it is a debt we must  
pay to each other, and I hope when you want  
aid of this kind, you will find it.&quot;  
His servant, Christopher, had been in the  
room during the day, and almost the whole  
time on his feet. The General noticed it in  
the afternoon, and kindly told him to sit  
down.  
About five o&#x27;clock his old friend, Dr. Craik  
came aggin into the room, and approached the  
bedside. &quot;Doctor,&quot; said the General, &quot;I die  
hard, but I am not afraid to go. I believed  
from my first attack, that I should not sur  
vive it--my breath cannot last long.&quot; The  
doctor pressed his hand in silence, retired  
from the bed-side and sat by the fire, absorb.  
ed in grief.  
Between five and six the other physicians  
came in, and he was assisted to sit up in the  
bed. &quot;I feel I am going,&quot; said he; &quot;I thank  
you for your kind at entions, but I pray you  
to take no more trouble about me; let me go  
off quietly; I cannot last long.&quot; He lay  
down again; all retired except Dr. Craik.  
The General continued uneasy and restless,  
but without complaining frequently asking  
hat hour it was.  
Further remedies ware tried without avail

&quot;About ten o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes Mr. Lear, &quot;he  
made several attempts to speak to me before  
he could effect it. At length he said, &quot;I am  
just going. Have me decently buried, and  
do not let my body be put into the vault in  
less than three days after I am dead.&quot; I  
bowed assent, for I could not speak. He  
then looked at me again and said, &quot;Do you  
understand me?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Tis  
well,&quot; said he.  
&quot;About ten minutes before he expired  
which was between ten and eleven o&#x27;clock)  
his breathing became easier. He lay quietly;  
he withdrew his hand from mine and felt his  
own pulse. I saw his countenance change.  
I spoke to Dr. Craik, who sat by the fire.  
He came to the bedside. The General&#x27;s hand  
fell from his wrist. I took it in mine and  
pressed it to my bosom. Dr. Craik put his  
hands over his eyes, and he expired without  
a struggle or a sigh.&quot;  
While we were fixed in silent grief, Mrs.  
Washington, who was seated at the foot of  
the bed, asked with a firm and collected voice  
&quot;Is he gone?&quot; I could not speak, but held up  
my hand as a signal that he was no more.  
&quot;Tis well,&quot; said she in the same voice. &quot;All  
is now over; I shall soon follow him; I have  
no more trials to pass through.&quot;  
Torturing of the Widows.  
In the interior of New Calidonia, which is  
east of Vancouver&#x27;s Island and north of the  
river Columbia, among the tribe called &quot;Taw­  
wo-tins,&quot; who are also Babines, and also  
among other tribes in the neighborhood, the  
custom prevails of burning the bodies, with  
circumstances of peculiar barbarity to the  
widows of the deceased. The dead body of  
the husband is laid naked upon a large heap  
of resinous wood, his wife is then placed upon  
the body and covered over with a skin; the  
pile is then lighted, and the poor woman i

he notes, &quot;it hegan to snow; soon atter to harl,  
and then turned to a settted cold rain.&quot; Ha  
ing on an overcont, he continued his ride  
without regarding the weather, and did not  
return to his house till after  
His Secretary approached him with letter  
to he franked, that they might he taken to the  
post-office in the evening. Washington frank­  
ed the fetters, but observed that the weather  
was too hard to send a servant out with them.  
Mr. Lear perceived that snow was hanging  
from his hair, and exressed his fear that he  
had got wet; but he repited, &quot;No, his great coat  
had kept him dry.&quot; As dinner had been wait­  
ing for him, he sat down to table withont  
changing his dress. &quot;In the evening,&quot; writes  
his Secretary, &quot;he appeared as well as usual.&quot;  
On the following morning the snow was  
three inches deep, and still failing, which pre­  
vented him from taking his usual ride. Hte  
compiained of a sore throat, and had evident­  
ly takeir cold the day before. In the afternoon  
the weather cleared up, and he went out on  
the grounds between the house and the river,  
to marx some trees which were to be cut  
  
down. A hoarseness which had hung about  
him through the day, grew worse toward  
night; but he made light of it.  
nie was very cheerful in the evening, as he  
sat in the parfor with Mrs. Washington and  
Mr. Lear, amusing himself with the papers  
which nad been brought from the post-office.  
When he met with anything interesting or en­  
tertaining he would read it aloud, as well as  
his hoarsenes would permit, or he tistened and  
made occasional comments while Mr. Lear  
read the debates of the Vrginia Assembly.  
tin retiring to bed Mr. Lear suggested that  
he should take something to relieve his cold.  
&quot;o,&quot; replied he &quot;you know I never take any  
thing for a cold. Let it go as it came.&quot;  
In tas night he was extremely ill with  
asue and difficully of breatiiitg. 3an tW  
and three o clock in the morning he awoke  
Mrs. Washingion, who would have risen to  
call a servant, but he would not permit her,  
lest she should take cold. At daybreak, when  
the servant woman entered to make a fire, she  
was sent to call Mr. Lear. He lound the cren­  
eral breathing with difficulty and hardly able  
to utter a word intelirgibly. Washington de­  
sired that Dr. Craie, who lived in Alexandria,  
showld be sent for, and that in the meantime  
Rawlins, one of the overseers, should be sum-  
moned to biced him before the Doctor could  
arrive

ment was proper, and fearful that too much  
blood might be taken, begged Mr. Lear to stop  
  
it. When he was about to untie the string the  
General put up his hand to prevent him, and  
as soon as he could speak, murmured, &quot;more.&quot;  
more, but Mrs. Washington&#x27;s doubts prevail­  
ed and the bleeding was stopped, after about  
half a pint of blood had been taken. External  
applications were now made to the throat  
and his feet were bathed in warm water, but  
without affording any relief.  
His old friend, Dr. Craik, arrived between  
eight and nine, ahd two other physicians, Drs  
bick and Brown, were called int. Yarious rem­  
edies were tried, and additional bleeding; but  
all of no avail.  
&quot;About half-past four o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes Mr  
Lear, he desired me to call Mrs. Washington  
to his bedside, when he requested her to go  
down into his room and take from his desk  
two wills which she would find there, and  
bring them to him, which she did. Upon look­  
ing at them, he gave her one, which he ol­  
served was useless, as being superseded by the  
other, and desired her to burn it, which she  
did, and took the other and put into her closet.  
&quot;After this was done, I returned to his bed.  
side and took his hand. He said to me: &quot;I  
find I am going; my breath cannot last long.  
I believed from the first that the disorder  
would prove fatal. Do you arrange all my  
iilitary letters and papers. Arrange my a­  
counts and settle my books, as you know more  
abont them than any one else, and let Mr.  
Rawlins finish recording my other letters  
which he has begun.&quot; I told him this would  
be done. He then asked me if I recoliected  
any thing which it was essential for him to do,  
as he had a very short time to continue with  
us. I told him that I could recollect nothing:  
but that I hoped he was not so near his end.   
He observed, smiling, that he certainly was,  
and that as it was the debt which we must all  
pay, he loohed to the event with perfect resig­  
nation.&quot;  
In the course of the afternoon he app   
to be in graat pain and distress from the dift­  
cnlty of breathing, and frequently changed  
his posture in the Led. Mr. Lear endeavored  
  
to raise him and turn him with as much   
as possible. &quot;I am afraid I fatigne you too  
much,&quot; the General would say. Upon being  
red to the contrary, &quot;Well,  observed he,  
gratefully, &quot;it is a debt we must pay to each  
other, and I hope when you want aid of thi­  
kind you will find it.&quot;  
His servant, Christopher, had been in the  
room, and almost the whole time on his feet.  
The General noticed it in the afternoon and  
kindly told him to sit down.  
About five o&#x27;clock, his old friend, Dr. Cralk,  
came again into the room, and approached the  
bedside. &quot;Doctor,&quot; said the General, &quot;I die  
hard, but I am nof afraid to go. I believed,  
from my first attack, that I should not survive  
it-my breath cannot last long.&quot; The doctor  
pressed his hand in silence, retired from the  
dside, and vat by the fire, absorbed in grief.  
Ietween five and six the other physicians  
same in, and he was assisted to sef up in his  
bed. &quot;I fed I ain going,&quot; said he; &quot;I thank  
rou for your atteation, but I pray you to take  
to mors trouble about me; let me go off quiet.  
ly; I cannot last long.&quot; He lay, down again;  
all retired except br. Craik. The General con-  
inued uneasy and restless, but withont com­  
platning, frequently asking what hour it was.

&quot;About ten o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes Mr. Lear, &quot;he  
made several atlempts to speak to me before he  
could effectil. At length he said. &#x27;I am juar

His secretary approached him with letters to ; through.&#x27;  
be franked, that they might be taken to the pt»st j  
office in the evening. Washington franked the I  
letters, but observed that the weather was too j  
bad to send a servant out with them. Mr. Lear &#x27;  
perceived that snow waa hanging from his hair, &#x27;  
and expressed his fears that he had got wct; but j  
he replied, &quot;Xo, his great coat had kept him dry .”  
As dinner had been waiting for him, he sat down  
to the table without changing his dre.«s. &quot;In the  
evening,” writes his secretary, &quot;he appeared as  
well as usual.”  
On the following niornins: the snow was three  
inches deep and still falling, which prevt-nted him  
from takinL&#x27; his usual ride. He complained of a  
sore throat, and had evidently taken cold the dav  
before. In the afternoon the weather cleared up,  
and he went out on the grounds between the  
hou.se and the river, to mark some trees which  
were to be cut down. A hoarseness which had &#x27;  
hung about him through the day, grew worse to- I  
ward night, but he made light of it. j  
He was very cheerful in the evening, as he sat  
in the parlor with Mrs. Washington and Mr. :  
Lear, amusing him.self with the papers which  
had been brought from the post office. When i  
he met with anything interesting or entertaining j  
he would read it aloud, a.s well as his hoarseness &#x27;  
wouid permit, or he listened and made occasional  
comments while Mr. Lear read the debates of the  
Virginia Assembly.  
On retiring to bed Mr. Lear suggested that  
he_ should take something to relieve his cold.  
“Xo,&quot; replied he; “you know I never take any­  
thing for a cold. Let it go as it came.”  
In the night he was extremely ill with ague ari&#x27;l  
difficulty of breathing. Between two and three  
o’clock in the morning he awoke Mrs. Washinr-  
ton, who would have ri.sen to call a servant, but  
he would not permit her, lest she should’ take  
cold. At daybreak, when the servant wo^nan  
entered to make a fire, »he was .sent to call Mr.  
Lear. He found the general breathing with diffi­  
culty and hardly able to utter a word intelligibly.  
Washington desired that Dr. (.’raik, who lived in

meantime Kawlins, one of the overseers, should  
be .summoned to bleed him before the Doctor could

In the course of the afternoon he appeared to be  
in great pain and distres; from the disiculty of  
breathing, and frequently changing his posture in  
bed. Mr. Lran endeavored to raise and turn him  
with as much ease as possible. &quot;I am afraid I fa­

you will aind it.&quot;  
His servant, Christopher, had been in the room

kindly told him to sit down,  
At about five his old friend br. Craik, oame

Doctor,&quot; said the General, &quot;I die hard, but I am  
not afraid to go. I believed, fros my first attack

last long.&quot; The doctor pressed his hand in silence,  
retired from the bedside, and sat by the fire ab­

attention, but I pray you take no more trouble  
about me, let me ge off quietly; I cannot last long.&quot;

notes &quot;h began to snow, soon after to bail, and  
then turned to a settled cold rain.&quot; Having on  
an overcoat, he continued his ride without re­

His secretary approached him with letters to

On the following morning the snow was three  
inches deep and still falling, which prevented  
him from taking his usual ndc. He complained  
cf a sore throat, and had evidently taken cold  
the day before. In the afternoon the weather  
cleared up, and he went out on tbe grounds be­

?now, soon after to hail, and then turned to  
a settled cold rain.&quot; Having on an overcoat,  
ho continued his ride without regarding  
the weather, and did not return to  
his house till after three.  
His secretary approached him with  
letters to be franked, that they might be  
taken to the post office in the evening.  
Washington franked the letters, but ob  
served that the weather was too bad to  
send a servant out with them. Mr. Lear  
perceived 4hat snow was hanging from  
liis htar, and expressed his fears that lie had  
got yvet; but ho replied,44 No, hie great  
coat bad kept him dry.&quot; As dinner had  
been waiting for him, he sat down to the  
  
Stable without changing his dress. &quot; In the  
evening,&quot; writes his secretary,&quot; he appeared  
as well as usual.&quot;  
On the following morning the snow was  
three inches deep and still falling, which  
prevented bim from taking his usual  
rjde. He oomplained of a sore throat,  
and had evidently taken cold thft day  
beforo. In tho afternoon the weather  
  
cleared tip, ana tie went oui on me grounds  
between the house and the river, to mark  
?otpo trees which were to bo cut down. A  
hoarseness which had hung about him  
through tlio day grew worse towards night,  
blit he made light of it.  
I?e was very cheerful in the evening, as  
  
be satin the parlor with Mr?. Washington  
and Mr. Lear, amusing himself with the  
papers which had been brought from the  
postofficc. When be met with anything  
  
interesting or entertaining, lie would read it  
aloud as well as his hoarseness would permit,  
or ho listened and made occasional  
comments while Mr. Lear read tho debates  
of tho Virginia Assembly.  
On returning to bed, Mr. Lear suggested  
that lie should take something to relieve  
his cold. &quot; Xo,&quot; replied he, &quot; you  
know I never take anything for a cold. Lel  
it go as it came.&quot;  
  
In tho night he was extremely ill with  
ague and difficulty of breathing. Betweon  
two and tlnee o&#x27;clock in the morning ho  
awoko Mrs. Washington, who would havo  
i risen to call a servant, but ho would no1  
| permit her, lest she should take cold. At  
daybrake, when the servant woman entored  
! to make a fire, she was sent to call Mr.  
Lear. .Ho found tho General breathing  
with difficulty, and hardly able to utter a  
word intelligibly. Washington desired  
that Dr. Craik, who lived in Alexandria,  
should be sent for, and that in tho meantime  
Rawlins, ono of the overseers, should  
bo summoned, to bleed him before the doctor  
could arr&#x27;ve.  
  
A gurgle was prepared for his throat,  
but whenever lie attempted to swallow  
any of it, ho was convulsed and almost  
suffocated. Kawlins made his appearance  
soon after sunrise, but when the General&#x27;s  
arm was ready for tho operation, bccomo  
agitated. &quot; Don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot; said the Gen  
eral, as well as he could speak. Rawlins  
made an incision. 41 Tho orifico is not  
large enough,&quot; Baid &quot;Washington. The  
blood however, ran pretty freely, and Mrs.  
? --- -  
  
? it&amp;iiingiuu, uuceriain wiictner liie treatment  
was proper, and fearful that too much  
blood might bo taken, begged Mr. Lear to  
stop it. When ho was about to untie the  
string tho General put up his hand to prevent  
him, and as soon as ho could speak  
murmured,&quot; more,more but Mrs. Washington&#x27;s  
doubts prevailed, and the bleeding  
was stopped, after about half a pint of  
blood had been taken. External applications  
wcro now made to the throat, and  
his feet wcro bathed in warm water, but  
  
wmioiu aiiorcung any relict.  
His old friend, Dr. Craik, arrived between  
eight and nine, and two i ther pliysi.  
cians, Drs. Dick and Drown, were called  
in. Various remedies were tried, and  
additional bleeding, but fill of no avail.  
&quot;About half-past four o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes  
Mr. Lear, &quot;he desir?-d me to call MrsWashington  
to his bed side, when he requested  
her to go down into his room and  
take from his desk two wills which she did.  
Upon looking at them, he gave her one,  
which 6he observed was useless, as being  
  
superceded l&gt;y the other, and desired her  
to burn it, which she did, and took the  
other and put it into her closet.  
&quot; After this was done, I returned to  
his bedside and took liis hand. IIo baid to  
me : &quot; I find I am going; my breath cannot  
lust long. I believed from the firet  
that tlie disorder would prove fatal. Do  
you arrange all niv military letters and pa&#x27;  
pers. Arrange my accounts and settle my  
books, as you know more about them than  
any one else; and let Mr. Rawlins finish  
recording my other letters which lie lias  
begun.&quot; I told him this would be  
done. He then asked me if I recollected  
anything which it was essential for hiin  
?_ .1^. ? ? * *  
  
i?j uu, as lie nan a very snort timo to continuo  
wiiii us. I told him that I could recollect  
nothing ; but that I hoped he was  
not so near his end. Ho observed, smiling,  
that he certainly was, and that as it was  
the debt which wo must all pay, he  
looked to the event with perfect resignation.&quot;  
In the coursc of the afternoon he appeared  
to be in great pain and distress from  
the difficulty of breathing, and frequently  
changed his posture in the bed. Mr. Lear  
endeavored to raise hiin and turn him with  
as much ease as possible. &quot; I am afraid I  
fatigue you too much,&quot; the General would  
TT t -  
  
say. upon ueing assured to tho contrary,  
&quot;Well,&quot; observed he, gratefully, &quot; it is a  
debt wc must pay to each other, and I hope  
when you want aid of this kind you will  
find iu&quot;  
His servant, Christopher, had been in the  
room during the day, and almost the whole  
time on his feet. Tho General noticed it  
in the afternoon, and kindly told him to sit  
down.  
About 5 o&#x27;clock his old friend, Dr.  
Craik, came again into tbo room, and approachcd  
the bedside. &#x27; Doctor.&quot; 6aid the  
  
General, &quot; I die hard, but I am not afraid

hand in silence, retired from the bed*

or complaint.  
About ten o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes Mr. Lear,  
he made several attempts to speak to me  
before he could effect it. At length he  
said, &quot;I am just going. Have me decently  
buried, and do not let my body be put into  
the vault in less than three days after I  
am dead.&quot; I bowed assent, for I could  
not speak. He then looked at me again  
and said, &quot;Do you understand me?&quot; I  
replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Tis well,&quot; said he.  
About ten minutes before he expired  
(which was between ten and eleven o&#x27;clock  
on the night of December 14, 1799) his  
breathing became easier. He lay quietly;  
he withdrew his hand from mine and felt  
his own pulse. I saw his countenance  
change. I spoke to Dr. Craik, who sat  
by the fire. He came to the bedside.  
The General&#x27;s hand fell from his wrist, I  
took it in mine and pressed it to my bosom.  
Dr. Craik put his hand over his eyes,  
and he expired without a struggle or a  
sigh.  
While we were fixed in silent grief,  
Mrs. Washington, who was seated at the  
foot of the bed, asked with a firm and  
collected voice, &quot;Is he gone?&quot; I could  
not speak, but held up my hands as a  
signal that he was no more.&quot;Tis well,&quot;  
said she, in the same voice. &quot;All is now  
over; I shall soon follow him; I have no  
more trials to pass through.&quot;  
An English Jury, in a criminal case  
is said to have brought in the following  
verdict some years ago: &quot;Guilty, with

to snow, soon after it hail, and then turn­  
ed to a settled cold rain.” Having on  
an overcoat, he continued His ride with­  
out regarding tho weather, and did not  
return to his house till after three.  
His secretary approached him with  
letters to be franked, that they might be  
I taken to the post office in the evening.—  
! Washington franked tho letters, but ob­  
served that tho w eather was too bad to  
send a servant out with them. Mr. Lear  
perceived that snow 7, as ‘hanging from  
his hair, and expressed his fears that he  
had got wet; but he replied, “No, his  
great coat had kept him dry.” As din­  
ner had been waiting for him, ho sat  
down to table without changing his dress.  
“In the evening,” writes his secretary,  
••he appeared a* well as usual.”  
  
On the following morning the snow  
was three inches deep and st’ll falling,  
which prevented him taking his usual  
ride. He complained of a sore throat,  
aud Lad evidently taken cold tlie day j  
before. In the afternoon the weather j  
cleared up, and he went out on the i  
grounds between the house and the river !  
to mark some trees which were to be cut |  
down. A hoarseness which lmd hung j  
about him through tho day grew worse  
toward night, but he made light of it.  
He was very cheerful in the evening as  
he sat in the parlor with Mrs. Washing­  
ton and Mr. Lear, amusing himself with  
(ho papers which had been brought from  
tho post office. When be mot with any­  
thing interesting or entertaining,he would  
read it aloud as weil as his hoarsness  
would permit, or he listened and made :  
occasional comments while Mr. Lear rend  
the debate of the Virgina Assembly.  
On retiring to bed, Mr. Lear suggest­  
ed that lio should take something to re­  
lieve his cold. “No,” replied he, “you  
know I never take anything for cold.—  
Let it go ns it came.”  
In tho night he was extrcmly ill with  
ague and difficult of breathing. Between  
two and three o&#x27;clock in the morning he  
awoke Mrs. Washington, who would have  
risen to call a servant, but ho would not  
permit her lest she should take cold.—  
At day-break, when tho servant, entered j  
to make a fire, she was sent to call Mr* j  
Lear. He found him breathing with diffi- j  
cnlty, and hardly able to utter a word  
intelligibly. Washington desired that  
Dr. Craik, who lived in Alexandria,  
should be sent for, and that in the mean­  
time Rawlins, one of the overseers,should  
bo summoned, to bleed him before the  
doctor could arrive.  
A gurgle was prepared for Lis throat  
but whenever he attempted to swallow  
any of it, he was convulsed and almost  
suffocated. Rawlins made his appear­  
ance soon after sunrise, but when the  
General’s arm was ready for the opera­  
tion,became agitated. “Don’t he afraid,’’  
said the General as well as he could  
speak. Rawlins made an inctision. “The  
orifice is not large enough,” said Wash­  
ington.  
The blood, however, ran pretty freely, j  
and Mrs. Washington, uncertain whether  
the treatment was proper, and fearful that  
too much blood might be taken, begged  
Mr. Lear to stop it. When ho was  
about to untie the string, the General put  
up his hand to prevent him, aud as soon  
as ho could speak murmured, “more,  
more;” but Mrs. Washington&#x27;s doubts  
prevailed, and the bleeding was stopped,  
after about half a pint of blood had been  
taken. External applications were now  
made to tho throat, and his feet were  
bathed in warm water, but without afford­  
ing any relief.

and additional Heeding, but all of no  
avail.  
“About half past four o’clock,” writes  
Mr. Lear, “he desired me to call Mrs.  
Washington to his bedside, when he re­  
quested her to go down into his room and  
take from his desk two wills which she  
would find there, and bring them to him,  
which she did. Upon looking at them he  
gave her one, which he observed was  
useless, as being superceded by the other,  
and desired her to burn it, which she did  
and took the other aud put it into her  
closet.  
“After this was done, I returned to  
his bedside and took his hand. He said  
to me: ‘I find I am going, my breath can­  
not last long. I believed from the first  
that tho disorder would prove fatal. Do  
you arrange all my military letters and  
papers. Arrange my accounts and set.

them than any one else; and let Mr. Raw­  
lins finish recording my other letters which  
he lias begun,’ I told him this would be  
done. He then asked me if I roccolloct­  
| anything which it was essential for him  
to do, as ho had a very short time to  
continue with us. 1 toll him that I could  
recollect nothing; but that l hoped he  
was not so near his end. He observed,  
smiling, that ho certainly was, and that it  
was the debt which we must all pay; he  
looked to tho debt with perfect resigna­  
| tion.”  
j In the course of the afternoon ho ap­  
j pcard to ho in great paiu and distress  
from the difficulty of breathing, and fre­  
quently changed his posture in bed. Mr.  
I Bear endeavored to raise him and turn  
him with a-, much -.aso as possible. “I  
  
am afraid I fatigue you too much,” the  
General would say. Upon being asured  
to tho contrary, “Well,” observed he  
gratefully, “it is a debt wo must pay to  
each other, and 1 hope when you want  
aid of this kind you will find it.”  
Ill’s servant Christopher, had been in  
the room during the day, and almost the  
whole time on his feet. The General  
noticed it in the afternoon, and kindly  
told him to sit down.  
About five o&#x27;clock, his old friend, Dr.  
Craik came again into the room, aud ap­  
proached the bedside. “Doctor.” said the  
General, “1 die hard, but I am not  
afraid t&lt;&gt; go. I believed, from my first at­  
tack that 1 should not survive it—my  
breath cannot last long.” The doctor  
pressed his hand in silence, retired from  
the bedside, and sat by the fire absorbed  
in grief.  
Between five and six the other physi  
cialis came in, an Ihe was assisted to sit  
up in his bed. “I feel I am going,’’  
said lie: “I thank you for you attentions,  
but l pray you to take no more trouble

order would prove fatal. Do you arrange all

more about them than any one else and

this would be done He&#x27;then asked me if I   
recollected anything which it was eraential   
for him to do, as he&#x27; had a very short time   
to con tinue with us. I told him that 1 could   
recollect nothing ; but that I hoped he was   
not so near his etid. He observed. smiling   
that he certainly was, ar.d that as it wan the   
debt which we all must pay, he looked to   
the event with perfect resignition.&quot;   
  
iu the course of the&#x27; afternoon he appear   
ed to great pain and distress from the diffi­  
culty in breathing, and frequently changed   
his posture in the bed. Mr. Lear endeavor­  
ed to raise him and turn him with as much   
ease as possible. &#x27;I am afraid I fatigue   
you too much, &quot; the general would say.   
Upon being assured to the contrary, &quot;Well,&quot;   
observed he, gratefully, &quot;It Is a debt we   
must pay to each other, And I hope when   
you want aid of this kind you will fled it.&quot;

her, lest she should take cold. At day­  
break, when the servant woman entered to  
make a fire, she was sent to call Mr. Lear.  
He found the General breathing with diffi­  
culty and hardly able to utter a worJ in  
telligibly. v asinngton uesireu mat ur.  
Craik, who lived in Alexandria, should be  
sent for, and that in the meantime Rawlins  
one of the overseers, should be summoned,  
lo bleed him before the Doctor could ar­  
rive.A gurgle was prepared for his throat,  
but whenever he attempted to swallow any  
of it, he was convulsed and almost suffo­  
cated. Rawlins made his appearance soon  
after sunrise, but when the General&#x27;s arm  
was ready for the operation, became agi­  
tated. &#x27; Don&#x27;t be afraid,&#x27; said the general  
as well as he could speak. Rawlins made  
an incision. &#x27; The orifice is not large  
enough,&quot; said Washington. Tho blood  
however, ran pretty freely, and Mrs. Wash­  
ington, uncertain whether the treatment  
was proper, and fearful that too much  
blood might be taken, begged Mr. Lear to  
stop it. When he was about to untie the  
string the General put up his hand to pre­  
vent him, and as soon as he could speak  
murmured &#x27;more, more ;&#x27; but Mrs. Wash­  
ington&#x27;s doubts prevailed, and the bleeding  
was stopped, at&#x27;ier about half a pint of  
blood had been taken. External applica­  
tions were now made to the thront, and his  
feet were bathed in warm water, but with  
out affording any relief.  
His old friend, Dr. Craik, arrived be­  
tween eight and nine, and two other phy­  
sicians, Drs. Dick and lirown, were called  
in. Various remedies were tried, and addi­  
lionnl bleeding, but all of no avail.

overcoat, he continued his ride without  
  
regarding the weather, and did not re­  
turn to his house till after three.  
His secretary approached him with let­  
ters to be franked, that they might be ta­  
ken to the post-office in the evening.  
Washington franked the letters, but ob­  
served that the weather was too bad to  
send a servant out with them. Mr. Lear  
perceived that snow was hanging from his  
hair, and expressed his fears that he had  
got wet; but he replied, &quot;No, his great­  
coat had kept him dry.&quot; As dinner had  
been waiting for him, he sat down to the  
table without changing his dress. &quot;In  
the evening,&quot; writes his secretary, &quot;he ap­  
peared as well as usual.&quot;  
On the following morning the snow was  
three inches deep and still falling, which  
prevented him from taking his usual ride.  
He complained of a sore throat, and had  
evidently taken cold on the day before.  
In the afternoon the weather cleared up,  
and he went out on the grounds between  
  
the house and the river to mark some  
trees which were to be cut down. A hoarse­  
ness which had hung about him through  
  
the day grew worse toward night, but he  
made light of it.  
He was very cheerful in the evening, as  
he sat in the parlor with Mrs. Washington  
and Mr. Lear, amusing himself with the  
papers which had been brought from the  
post-office. When he met with any thing  
interesting or entertaining, he would read  
it aloud as well as his hoarseness would per­  
mit, or he listened and made occasional

would have risen to call a servant, but he  
would not permit her, lest she should take  
  
cold. At daybreak, when the servant  
woman entered to make a fire, she was  
sent to call Mr. Lear. He found the Gen­  
eral breathing with difficulty, and hardly  
able to utter a word intelligibly. Wash­  
ington desired Dr. Craik, who lived in  
Alexandria, should be sent for, and that  
in the meantime Rawlins, one of the over­  
seers, should be summoned to bleed him  
before the doctor could arrive.  
A gargle was prepared for his throat, but  
whenever he attempted to swallow it, he  
was convulsed and almost suffocated.  
  
Rawlins made his appearance soon after  
  
sunrise, but when the General s arm was  
ready for the operation, became agitated.  
&quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot; said the General, as  
well as he could speak. Rawlins made  
an incision. &quot;The orifice is not large  
enough,&quot; said Washington. The blood,  
however, ran pretty freely, and Mrs.  
Washington, uncertain whether the treat­  
ment was proper, and fearful that too  
much blood might be taken, begged Mr.  
Lear to stop it. When he was about to  
untie the string, the General put up his  
hand to prevent him, and as soon as he  
could speak, murmured, &quot;More, more;&quot;  
but Mrs. Washington&#x27;s doubts prevailed,  
and the bleeding was stopped, after about  
  
a half-pint of blood had been taken. Ex­  
ternal applications were now made to the  
throat, and his feet were bathed in warm  
  
water, but without affording any relief.  
His old friend, Dr. Craik, arrived be­  
tweeneight and nine, and two other phy­  
sicians, Drs. Dick and Brown, were called  
in. Various remedies were tried, and ad­  
ditional bleeding, but all of no avail.  
&quot;About half-past four o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes  
Lear, &quot;he desired me to call Mrs.  
Wshington to his bed-side, when he re­  
quested her to go down to his room, and  
take from his desk two wills which she  
would find there, and bring them to him;  
which she did. Upon looking at them, he  
gave her one, which he observed was use­  
less, as being superseded by the other, and  
desired her to burn it, which she did, and  
took the other and put it into her closet.  
&quot;After this was done I returned to his  
bedside and took his hand. He said to  
me: &quot;I find I am going; my breath can­  
not last long. I believed from the first  
that the disorder would prore fatal. Do  
  
you arrange my military letters and pa­  
pers. Arrange my accounts and settle my  
books, as you know more about them  
  
than any one else; and let Mr. Rawlins  
finish recording my other letters which he  
has begun.&quot; I told him this would be  
done. He then asked me if I recollected  
anything which it was essential for him  
to do, as he had a very short time to con­  
tinue with us. I told him that I could  
recollect nothing, but that I hoped he  
was not so near his end. He observed,  
smiling, that he certainly was, and that as  
it was the debt which we must pay, he  
looked to the event with perfect resigna­  
tionl the sourse of the afterncon he ap­  
peared to be in great pain and distress  
teot the dimet a ia o  
  
each other, and I hope when you want  
aid of this kind you will find it.&quot;  
His servant, Christopher, had been in  
the room during the day, and almost the  
whole time on his feet. The General no­  
ticed it in the afternoon, and kindly told  
him to sit down.  
About five o&#x27;clock his old friend, Dr.  
Craik, came again into the room and ap­  
proached the bedside. &quot;Doctor,&quot; said the  
General, &quot;I die hard, but I am not afraid  
to go. I believed from my first attack  
that I should not survive it; my breath

his hand in silence, and retired from the

&quot;About ten o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes Mr. Lear,  
&quot;he made several attempts to speak to  
me before he could effect it. At length  
he said, &quot;I am just going. Have me de­  
cently buried, and do not let my body be

could not speak. He then looked at me  
again and said, &quot;Do you understand me?&quot;  
I replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;&#x27;Tis well,&quot; said he.  
&quot;About ten minutes before he expired,  
(which was between ten and eleven o&#x27;clock

breathing became easier. He lay quietly;

Dr. Craik put his hand over his eyes, and  
he expired without a struggle or a sigh.  
&quot;While we were fixed in silent grief,  
Mrs. Washington, who was seated at the  
foot of the bed, asked with a firm and  
collected voice, &quot;Is he gone?&quot; I could not  
speak, but held up my hand as a signal  
that he was no more. &quot;&#x27;Tis well,&#x27; said  
she, in the same voice. &quot;All is now over:

In the course of the afternoon he appeared to  
be in great pain and distress from the difficulty of  
breathing, and frequently changed his posture in  
the bed. Mr. Lear endeavored to raise him and  
turn him with as much ease as possible. “I am  
afraid I fatigue you too much,” the General would  
say. Upon being assured to the contrary, “ Well,”  
observed he, gratefully, “ It is adebt we must pay  
to each other, and I hope when you want aid of  
this kind you will find it.”  
  
His servant, Christopher, had been in the room  
  
feet. The General noticed it in the afternoon, and  
kindly told him to sit down.  
  
At about five his old friend, Dr. Craik, came  
again into the room, and approached the bedside.  
Doctor,” said the General, “I die hard, but I am  
not afraid to go. I believed, from my first attack,  
that I should not survive it—my breath cannot last  
long.” The doctor pressed his hand in silence, re-  
tired from the bedside, and sat by the fire absorbed  
in grief.  
  
Between five and six the other physicians came  
in, and he was assisted to sit up in his bed. «J  
feel I am going,” said he: “I thank you for your  
attentions, but I pray you to take no more trouble  
about me; let me go off quietly; I cannot last  
long.” He lay down again ; all retired excepting  
Dr. Craik. The General continued uneasy and  
restless, but without complaining, frequently asking

« About ten o&#x27;clock,” writes Mr. Lear, “he made  
several attempts to speak to me before he could  
effect it. At length he said, ‘I am just going.  
Have me decently buried, and do not let my body  
be put into the vault in less than three days after  
I am dead.’ I bowed assent, for I could not speak.  
He then looked at me again and said, ‘ Do you un-

« About ten minutes before he expired (which  
was between ten and eleven o&#x27;clock) his breathing  
became easier. He lay quietly; he withdrew his  
hand from mine and felt his own pulse. I saw his  
countenance change. I spoke to Dr. Craik, who  
sat by the fire. He came to the bedside. The  
  
General’s hand fell from his wrist. — I took it in  
mine and pressed it tomy bosom. Dr. Craik put  
his hands over his eyes, and he expired without a  
struggle or a sigh.  
  
“While we were fixed in silent grief, Mrs.  
Washington, who was seated at the foot of the bed,  
asked with a firm and collected voice, ‘ Is he gone ?’  
I could not speak, but held up my hand as a signal  
that he was no more. ‘’Tis well,’ said she, in the  
same voice. * All is now over; I shall soon follow  
him ; I have no more trials to pass through.”

snow, soon after to hail, then turned to a  
settled cold rain.&quot; Having on an over­  
coat, he continued his ride without regard­  
ing the weather, and did not return to his  
house till after three.  
His secretary approached him with let­  
ters to be franked, that they might be ta  
ken to the post office in the evening.  
Washington franked the letters, but obsery­  
ed that the weather was too bad to send a  
servant out with them. Mr. Lear per­  
ceived that snow w as hanging from his  
hair, and expressed his fears that he had  
got wet; but he replied, &quot;No, his great  
coat had kept him dry.&quot; As dinner had  
been waiting for him, he sat down to the  
table without changing his dress. &quot;In the  
evening,&quot; writes his secretary, &quot;he appear­  
ed as well as usual.&quot;  
On the following morning the snow was  
three inches deep and still falling, which  
prevented him from taking his usual ride.  
He complained of a sore throat, and had  
evidently taken cold the day before. In  
the afternoon the weather cleared up, and  
he went out on the grounds between the  
house and the river, to mark some trees  
which were to be cut down. A hoarse­  
ness which had hung about him through  
the day grew worse towards night, but he  
made light of it.  
He was very cheerful in the evening, as  
he sat in the parlor with Mrs. Washington  
and Mr. Leer, amusing himself with the  
papers which had been brought from the  
post office. When he met with anything  
interesting or entertaining, he would read  
it aloud as well as his hoarseness would  
permit, or he listened and made occasional  
comments while Mr. Lear read

in the meantime Rawlins, one of the over­  
seers, should be summoned, to bleed him  
before the Doctor could arrive.  
A gargle was prepared for the throat,  
but whenaver he attempted to swallow any  
of it he was convulsed and almost suffoca­

after sun rise, but when the general&#x27;s arm

ing was stopped, after about half a pint of  
bloodhad been taken. External applica­  
tions were how made to the throst and his  
feet were bathed in warm water, but with­  
out affording any relief.  
His old friend, Dr. Craik, arrived be  
tween eight and nine, and two other phy  
sicians, Drs. Dick and Brown, were called  
in. Various remedics were tried, and ad­  
ditional bleeding, but all of no avail.  
&quot;About half past four o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes  
Mr. Lear, &quot;he desired me to call Mrs.  
Washington to his bedside, when he re­  
quested her to go down into his room, and  
take from his desk two wills which she  
would find there, and bring them to him,  
which she did. Upon looking at them, he  
gave her one, which he observed was use­  
less, as being superseded by the other, and  
desired her to burn it, which she did, and  
took the other and put it into her closet.  
&quot;After this was done I returned to his  
bedside and took his hand. He said to  
me, &quot;I find I am going; my breath can­  
not last long. I believed from the first  
that disorder would prove fatal. Do you  
arrange all my military letters and papers.  
Arrange my accounts and settle my books,  
as you know more about them than any  
one else; and let Mr. Rawlins finish record­  
ing my other letters which he has begun  
  
I told him this would be done. He then  
asked me if I recollected anything which  
it was essential for him to do, as he had a  
very short time to continte with us. I  
told him that I could recollect nothing,  
but hoped that he was not so near his end.  
He observed, smiling, that he certainly  
was, and that as it was the debt which all  
must pav, he looked to the event with per­  
fect resignation.&quot;  
In the course of the afternoon he ap­  
peared to be in great pain and distress  
from the difficulty of breathing, and fro­  
quently changed his posture in the bed.  
Mr. Lear endeavored to raise him with as  
much ease as possible. &quot;I am afraid I  
fatigue you too much,&quot; the general would  
say. Upon being assured to the contrary,  
&quot;Well,&quot; observed he gratefully, &quot;it is a  
debt which we must pay to each other, and  
I hope when you want aid of this kind  
you will find it.&quot;  
His servant Christopher, had been in  
the room during the day, and almost the  
whole time on his feet. The general no­  
ticed it in the afternoon, and kindly told  
him to sit down.  
About five o&#x27;clock his old friend, Dr.  
Craik, came again into the room, and ap­  
proached the bedside. &quot;Doctor,&quot; said the  
general, &quot;I die hard, but I am not afraid  
to go. I believed from my first attack,  
tuat I should not survive it--my breath  
cannot last long.&quot; The doctor pressed his  
hand in silence, retired from the bedside,  
and sat by the fire absorbed in grief.  
Between five and six the other physi­  
cians came in, and he was assisted to sit  
up in his bed. &quot;I feel I am going,&quot; said  
he; &quot;I thank you for your attentions, but  
I pray you to take no more trouble about  
me; let me go off quietly; I cannot last  
long.&quot; He lay down again; all retired  
except Dr. Craik. The general continued  
uneasy and restless, but without complain­  
ing frequently asking what hour it was.  
Further remedies were tried withon

ing on an overcoat, be continued his ride with­  
out regarding the weather, and did not return  
to his house till after 3.  
His Secretary approached him with letters  
to be franked, that they might be taken to the  
postufHcc in the evening. Washington frank­  
ed the letters, but observed that the weather  
was too had to send a servant out with them.  
Mr. Lear perceived that snow was hanging  
from his hair, and expressed his fears that ho  
had got wet ; but lie replied, &quot; Xn, his great  
coat had kept him dry.&quot; As dinner had been  
waiting for him, he sat down to table with­  
out changing his dress. “In the evening,&quot;  
writes his Secretary, “ ho appeared as well os  
usual.”  
Ou the following morning the snow was  
three inches deep and still falling, which pre­  
vented him from taking his usual rids. He  
complained of a sore throat, and bad evidently­  
taken cold the day before. In the afternoon  
the weather cleared up, and he went out on  
the grounds between thedwuso and the river,  
to mark some trees which were to be cut down.  
A hoarseness which had hung about him  
through dio day grew worse toward night, but  
he made light of it.  
He wan very cheerful in the evening, as he  
sat in the parlor with Mrs. Washington and  
Mr. Lear, amusing himself with tho papers  
which had been brought from the post office.  
Win n he met with anything interesting or en­  
tertaining, ho would read it aloud as well as  
his hoarseness would permit, or ho listened  
and made occasional comments while Mr. Lcnr  
rend (he dignitied debates of the Virginia As­  
sembly.  
On retiring to bed, Mr. Lear suggested that  
he should take something to relieve his cold.  
“ No.&quot; replied he, *• you know I never take  
anything for a cold. L?titgo os It came.”  
In tho night he was extremely ill with ague,  
and difficulty of breathing. Between two and  
three o’clock in the morning, he awoke Mrs.  
Washington, who would have risen to call s  
servant, but be would not permit her, lest she  
should take cold. At daybreak, when tho  
servant woman entered to make a Ore, she was  
sent to call Mr. Lear. Ho found the General  
breathing with difficulty, and hardly able to  
utter a word intelligibly. Weshington desired  
that Ur. Craik, who lived in Alexandria,should  
be sent for, and that in the mean time Raw­  
lins, one of the overseers, should be sum­  
moned, to bleed him before the Doctor could  
arrive.  
A gargle was prepared for hie throat, bat  
whenever he attempted to awallow any of it,  
he was convulsed and almost suffocated. Raw­  
lins made his appearance soon after sunrise,  
but wh#n tha General&#x27;s arm was ready for the  
operation, became agitated. “ Don&#x27;t bo afraid,”  
said the General, as well aa he could speak.  
Rawlins made an incision. &quot;The orifice is  
not large enough,&quot; said Washington. The  
blood, However, ran pretty freely, and Mrs.  
Washington, uncertain whether the treatment  
was proper, end fearftii that too mueh btood  
might be taken, begged Mr. Lear to stop It  
When he was about to untie the string, the  
General put up his band to prevent him, and  
as soon as he «mid apeak, murmured “ more,  
more,*&#x27; but Mr*. Washington&#x27;s efforts prevail­  
ed. and the bleeding was stopped, after about  
half a pint, of blood had been taken. Exter­  
nal applications were now made to the throat,  
and bis feet were bathed In warm water, but

&quot; Aboht hklf-past four o’clock,&quot; write* Mr.  
Lear, “ he desired me to call Mrs. Washington  
  
to hi» bed side, when he requested her to go  
down into hi» room, end take from his desk  
two wills which she would And there, and  
bring them to him, which she did. Upon  
looking at them, he gave her one, which he  
observed was useless, as being superseded by  
the other, and denired her to burn it, which  
she did, and took tho other and put it into her  
closet  
“ After this wn» done, I returned to hit  
bed»ido and took his hand. 110 said to me:  
‘1 find I am going; my breath cannot laat  
long. I believed from tho first that tho disor­  
der would prove fatal. Do you arrange all  
iny military lettura and papers. Arrange my  
accounts and settle my books, as you know  
more about them than any one else ; and let  
Mr. Rawlins finish recording my other lettera  
which he baa begun.’ I told him this would  
be done. He then asked me if I recollected  
anything which it was essential for him to do,  
aa he had a very abort time to continue with  
ua. I told him that I could recollect nothing ;  
but that I hoped he was not so near his end.  
He observed, smiling, that he certainly was,  
and that aa it waa the debt which wo must  
all pay, lie looked to the event with perfect  
resignation.”  
In the course of tho afternoon he appeared  
to be in great pnin and distress from the dif­  
ficulty of breathing, and frequently changed  
Ilia poature in the bed. Mr. Lear endeavored  
to raise him and turn him with as much eaae  
as possible. “ I am afraid I fatigue you too  
mudi,” the General would say. Upon being  
assured to the contrary—•• Well,” observed  
he, gratefully, “it is a debt we must pay to  
each other, and I hope when you want aid of  
this kind you will find it,”  
His servant Christopher had been in tho  
room during the dvr, and almost the whole  
time on his feet. The General noticed it in  
the afternoon, and kindly told him to sit down.  
About 6 o&#x27;clock his old friend Dr. Craik,  
came again into the room and approached the  
bedside.  
“Doctor,&quot; said tho General, &quot;I die hard,  
but lam not afraid to go. I believed, from  
roy first attack, that I should not survive it—  
my breath cannot last long.” The doctor  
pressed bis ham) in silence, retired from the  
bedside and sat by the fire, absorbed in grief.  
Between five and six the other physicians  
came in, and he was assisted to sit up in bis  
bed. “ I feel lam going,” said he ; I “ thank  
you for your attentions, but I pray you to  
take no more trouble about me; let me go  
off quietly ; I cannot lost long.” He lay down  
again; all retired except Dr. Craik. The  
General continued uneasy and restless, but  
without complaining, frequently asking what  
hour it was.  
Further remedies were tried without avail  
in the evening. Hu took whatever was offered  
him, did as lie was desired by Hie physicians,  
and never uttered a sigh or complaint.  
“ About ten o&#x27;clock,” writes Mr. Lear, “he  
made several attempts to speak to me before  
be could effect it. At length ho said, “1 am  
just going. Have mo decently buried, and  
do not let my body be put into the vault in  
less than three days after I am dead.&quot; I  
bowed assent, for I could not speak. Hu then  
looked at me again and said, ‘Do you under­  
stand me!11 replied, ‘ Yes.’ ‘Tis well,’said  
lie.  
“About ten minutes before he expired (which  
was between ten and eleven o’clock, on tho  
night of December 14-, 1700.) his breathing  
bucamo easier, lie lay quietly ; he withdrew  
his hand from mine and felt bis own pulse. I  
saw his countenance change. I spoke to Dr.  
Craik, who oat by the fire. Ho came to the  
bedside. The General&#x27;ls hand fell from his  
wrist. I took it in mine and pressed it to my  
bosom. Dr. Craik put his hand over his eyes,  
and lie expired w ithout a struggle or a sigh,  
“While wo were fixed in silent grief, Mrs.  
Washington, who waa seated at the foot of the  
bed, asked with a firm anil collected voice,  
&#x27;ls he gone f’ I could not apeak, but hold up  
my hand as a signal that ho was no more.—

and then turned to a settled cold rain.&quot; Hav.  
ing on an overcoat, he continued his ride with  
out regarding the weather, and did not return  
to his house till after three.  
His secretary approached him with letters to  
be franked, that they might be taken to the post  
office in the evening. Washington franked the  
letters, but observed that the weather was too  
bad to send a servant out with them. Mr.  
Lear preceived that snow was hanging from  
his hair, and expressed his fears that he had  
got wet; but he replied, &quot;No, his great coat  
had kept him dry.&quot; As dinner had been wait  
ing for him, he sat down to table without  
changing his dress. &quot;In the evening,&quot; writes  
his secretary, &quot;he appeared as well as usual.  
On the following morning the snow was three  
inc hes deep and still falling, which prevented  
him from taking his usual ride. He complained  
of a sore throat and had evidently taken cold  
the day before. In the afternoon the weather  
cleared up, and he went out on the grounds  
between the house and the river, to mark some  
trees which were to be cut down. A hoarsen­  
ess which had hung about him through the  
day grew worse toward night, but he made  
light of it.  
He was very cheerful in the evening, as he  
sat in the parlor with Mrs. Washington and Mr.  
Lear, amusing himself with the papers which  
had been brought from the post office. When  
he met with anything interesting or entertains

ashington, who would have risen to call a  
servant, but he would not permit her, lest she  
should take cold. At daybreak, when the ser  
entered to make a fire, she was  
sent to call Mr. Lear. He found the General  
breathing with difficulty, and hardly able to  
utter a word intelligibly. Washington desired  
that Dr. Craik, who lived in Alexandria, should  
be sent for, and that in the meantime Rawlins,  
one of the overseers, should be summoned, to  
bleed him before the doctor could arrive.  
A gargle was prepared for his throat, but  
whenever he attempted to swallow any of it he  
was convulsed and almost suffocated. Rawlins  
made his appearance soon after sunrise, but  
when the General&#x27;s arm was ready for the op­  
eration, became agitated. &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot;  
said the General, as well as he could speak.  
Rawlins made an incision. &quot;The orifice is not  
large enough,&quot; said Washington. The blood,  
however, ran pretty freely, and Mrs. Wash­  
ington, uncertain whether the treatment was  
proper, and fearful that too much blood might  
be taken, begged Mr. Lear to stop it. When  
he was about to untie the string, the General  
put up his hand to prevent him, and as soon  
as he could speak, murmured &quot;more, more;&quot;  
but Mis. Washington&#x27;s douhts prevailed, and  
the bleeding was stopped, after ahout half a pint  
of blood had heen taken. External applications  
were now made to the throat, and his feet were  
hathed in warm water, but without affording  
any relief.

of no avail.  
&quot;Ahout half-past four o&#x27;clock,&quot; writes Mr.  
Lear, &quot;he desired me to call Mrs. Washington  
to his bed-side, when he requested her to go  
down into his room, and take from his desk two  
wills which she would find there, and bring  
them to him, which she did. Upon looking at  
them, he gave her one, which he observed was  
useless, as being superseded by the other, and  
desired her to burn it, which she did, and took  
the other and put it into her closet.  
&quot;After this was done, I returned to his bed­  
side and took his hand. He said to me: &quot;I find  
am going; my breath cannot last long. I be.­  
lieved from the first, that the disorder would  
prove fatal. Do you arrange all my military  
letters and papers. Arrange my accounts and  
settle my books, as you know more about them  
than any one else; and let Mr. Rawlins finish  
  
recording my other letters, which he has begun.&quot;  
I told him this would be done. He then asked  
me if I recollected anything which it was essen  
tial for him to do, as he had a very short time  
to continue with us. I told him that I could  
recollect nothing, but that I hoped he was not  
so near his end. He observed, smiling, that  
he certainly was, and that as it was a debt which  
we all must pay, he looked to the event with  
perfect resignation.  
In the course of the afternoon, he appeared  
to be in great pain and distress from the diffi­  
culty of breathing, and frequently changed his  
posture in the bed. Mr. Lear endeavored to  
raise him and turn him with as much ease as  
possible. &quot;I am afraidl fatigue you too much,&quot;

the contrary, &quot;Well,&quot; observed he gratefully,

1 to murk some trees, which were to be out down  
A hoarseness wlibii bad bung about him  
through tho day grew worse toward night, but  
he made light of it. lie was very cboenitll in  
the evening, as he sat in the parlor with Mrs.  
Washington and Mr. Lear, amusing himself  
with the papers which hod been brought from  
the post office. When he uiet with anything  
interesting pr entertaining, lie would read it  
aloud as well as his.hoarseness would permit,  
or he listened and tuada occasional comments  
while Mr. Lear read the debates of tbe Vir­  
ginia Assembly.  
On retiring to bed. Mr. Lear suggested that  
he should take something to relievo his cold.  
; No,&#x27;:.replied he, &quot;you know, J never take  
anything for ft cold. Let it go as it came,&quot;  
In the night he was extremely ill with ugje  
and ditfietilty of,breathing. Between 2 and if  
o&#x27;clock in the morning he awoke Mrs. Wash­  
ington, who would have risen to call a servant  
but lie would not permit her lest she should  
take cold. At day break, when the servant  
woman cutcred to make a fire, she was sent to  
call Mr. Lear. He found tbe general breath­  
ing with difficulty, and hardly able to utter a  
  
word intelligibly. Washington desired tint  
l)r. Craik, who lived in Alexandria, should  
he sent for, and that id the meanwhile Raw­  
lins, one of the overseers should be sumniond  
to bleed him before the doctor could arrive  
A gargle was prepared for his throat, but,  
whenever he attempted to swallow any of it,  
he was convulsed t&#x27;.ud almost suffocated,—  
Rawlins tnade his appearance soon after sun­  
rise, bt when the general&#x27;s arm was ready  
for the operation, become agitated. &quot;Don&#x27;t  
be afraid,&quot; said the general, as well as ho  
could speak.  
Rawlins made an incision. &quot;The orifice is  
not large enough,&quot; said Washington. The  
ldood however yap. pretty freely, and TV&#x27;is.  
Washington, uncertain whether tho treatment  
was proper, and fearful that too much blood  
might be taken, bogged Mr. Lear to stop it.  
\\ hen he was about to untie the string the  
general put up his hand to prevent it, and ao  
soon as iio could speak murmured &quot;more,  
more,&#x27;&#x27; hut Mrs. Washinton&#x27;s doubts pre­  
vailed, and the bleeding was stopped, after  
about half a pint of blood had been taken.

oe Thursday, Dec. 12, the General rode out  
nis farm about 10 o&#x27;clock, and did not re-  
turn home till past 3. Soon after he went ous  
the weather became very bad—rain, hail, and  
snow falling alternately, with a cold wind.  
When he came in I carried some letters to  
to frank, intending to send them to the  
ffice in the evening. He franked the  
jetters, but said the weather was.too bad to  
a servan  
j observed to him that I was afraid he had  
wet. He said no, his great coat had  
gept him dry. But his neck appeared to be  
wet and the snow was hanging upon his  
. He came to dinner, which had been  
waiting for him, without changing his dress.  
In the evening he appeared as well as usual,  
a heavy fall of snow took place on Friday,  
ghich “prevented the General from riding  
out as usual. He had taken cold (undoubt-  
edly from being so much exposed the day  
pefore) and complained of a sore throat; he,  
however, went out in the afternoon intu  
the ground between the house and the river  
to mark some trees which were to be cut  
  
down in the improvement of that spot. He |  
  
had a hoarseness, which increased in the  
  
evening, but he made light of it. In the |  
evening the papers wer®e brought. from the |  
  
office, and he sat in the parlor, with  
  
Mrs. Washington and myself, reading them |  
  
till about 9 o’clock, when Mrs. W. went up  
  
into Mrs. Lewis’ room, who was confined, |  
in childbed, and left the General and myself |  
  
reading the papers. He was very cheerful,  
end when he met with anything interesting  
or enterta’ning he read it aloud as well as  
his ness would permit him. He re-  
quested me to read to him the debates of the  
Virginia Assembly on the election of a Sen-  
gtor and a Goyernor; and on hearing Mr.  
Madison&#x27;s observations suspecting Mr. Mon-  
roe he appeared much affected, and spoke  
with some degree of asperity on the sub-  
ject, which I endeavored to moderate, as I  
always did on such occasions. On his re-  
tiring I observed to him that he had better  
take something to remove his cold, He an-  
swered no, “ You know I never take an;-  
thing for acold. Let it go as it came.”  
Bled by a Servant.  
  
Béetween 2 and 3 o&#x27;clock on Saturday morn-  
ing he awoke Mrs. Washington, and told her  
he was very unwell, and had had an ague.  
She obse that he could scarcely speak,  
and breathed with difficulty, and would have  
got up to call a servant, but he would not  
‘permit her lest she should take cold. As  
sooh as the day appeared the woman (Caro-  
  
tine) went into the room to make a fire, and  
Mrs. Washington sent her immediately to  
eall me. I got up, put on my clothes as quick-  
ly as possible, and went to his chamber.  
Washington was then up, and related to  
“me his being taken ill, as before stated. I  
“found the General breathing with difficulty,  
‘and hardly able to utter a word intelligibly.  
’ He desired that Mr. Rawlings (one of the  
overseers) might be sent for to bleed him  
before the doctor could arrive. I dispatched  
a*servant instantly for Rawlings, and an-  
other for Dr. Craik, and returned again to  
the General’s chamber, where I found him in  
_the same situationaslIhadlefthim. A mix-  
‘Mire of molasses, vinegar, and butter was  
; fo try its effect on the throat; but  
Would not swallow a drop; whenever he  
it he appeared to be distressed,  
  
,and almost suffocated. Rawlings  
  
™ soon after sunrise and prepared to  
fhim. When the arm was ready the  
  
| , observing that Rawlings appeared  
tbeagitated, said, as well as he could speak,  
“Don&#x27;t be afraid,” and after the incision  
Was made he observed: ‘ The orifice is not  
large endugh.’’ However, the blood ran  
pretty freely. Mrs. Washington, not know-  
ing whether bleeding was proper or not in  
the General&#x27;s situation, begged that much  
might not be taken&lt;from him, lest it should  
be injurious, and desired me to stop it; but  
  
when I was about to untie the string, the  
  
General put up his hand to prever» it, and  
88 soon as he could speak, said: ‘* More,  
more.” Mrs. Washington being still un-  
  
| easy lest too much blood should be taken,  
  
was Stopped after taking about half a  
. Finding that no relief was obtained  
bleeding, and that nothing would go  
  
| . down the throat, I proposed bathing it ex-  
_ termally with salvolatila, which was done,  
  
4 t  
  
if the operation, which was with the  
‘and in the gentlest manner, he ob-

a in salvolatila was put around his  
Reck and his feet bathed in warm water,  
‘Wut without affording any relief.

Inthe meantime, before Dr. Craik arrived,  
Washington desired me to send fcr

7 recommended to be called if any case  
ee0uig ever occur that was seriously alarm-

nothing but a wish to give him ease, he re-  
plied: ‘* Well, it is a debt we must all pay to  
  
| each other, and I hope when you will want  
aid of this kind you will find it.”  
  
|  
| _ He asked when Mr. Lewis and Washing-  
  
ton Custis would return (they were in New  
Kent). I téld him about the 29th of the  
month. .  
  
About 5 o’clock Dr. Craik came into the  
room, and upon going to the bedside the  
General said to him: ‘“ Doctor, I die hard;  
but I am not afraid to go; I believed from my  
first attack that I should not survive it; my  
breath cannot last long.’’ The doctor pressed  
_his hand, but could not utter a word. He  
retired from the bedside and sat by the fire  
absorbed in grief.  
  
Between 5 and 6o0’clock Dr. Dick and Dr.  
Brown came into the room, and with Dr.  
Craik went to the bed: when Dr. Craik asked  
him if he could sit up in the bed he held out  
his hand and I raised him up.  
  
Feared Burial Alive.  
  
He then said to the physicians: “‘ I feel my-  
self going; I thank you for your attentions;  
but I pray you to take no more trouble about  
me; let me go off quietly; I cannot last  
long.’’ They feared that all which had been  
done was without effect: he laid down again  
  
t to the office that evening. + and all retired except Dr. Craik. He con-  
  
tinued in the same situation, uneasy and  
restless, but without complaining, frequent-  
ly asking what hour it was. When 1 helped  
him to move at this time he did not speak,  
but looked at me with strong expressions of  
gratitude, ~  
  
into the room and applied blisters and cata-  
plasms of wheat bran to his legs and feet,  
after which they went out (except Dr.  
Craik) without a ray of hope. I went out  
about this time and wrote a line to Mr. Law  
and Mr. Peter, requesting them to come  
| with their wives, Mrs. Washington&#x27;s grand-  
  
daughters, as soon as possible to Mount  
| Vernon. About 10 o’clock he made several  
  
attempts to speak ta, me before he could  
| effect it. At length he said:  
  
‘TIT am just going: have me decently  
buried, and do not let my body be put into  
the vault in less than three days after I am  
dead.’’  
  
I bowed assent, for I could not speak. He  
then looked at me again and said, *‘ Do you  
understand me?’”’ I replied, ‘‘ Yesx”’ ‘Tis  
well,’’ said he. About ten minutes before  
he expired (which was between 10 and 11  
o&#x27;clock) his breathing became easier; he  
lay quietly; he withdrew his hand from  
mine and feit his own pulse.  
  
I saw his countenance change. I spoke to  
Dr. Craik, who sat by the fire. He came to  
the bedside. The General’s hand fell from  
his wrist. I took it in mine and put it in  
my bosom.  
  
Dr. Craik put his hands over his eyes, and  
really he expired without a struggle or a  
sigh.  
  
While we wete filled with silent grief Mrs.  
Washington, who yras sitting at the foot of  
the bed, asked with a firm and collected  
voice, ‘“‘Is he gone?’ I could not speak,  
but held up my hand as a signal that he  
was no more.  
  
“’&#x27;Tis well,&quot;’ said she in the same voice.  
** All is now over. I shall soon follow him.  
I have no more trials to pass through.”’

that he certainly was. and as it was  
  
the debt which we must all pay he look

I endeavored to raise him and turn him

It Is a debt we must pay to each other.

Craik. came to his room. &#x27;Doctor, he  
  
said. &#x27;I die hard, but I am not afraid

his hands in silence, retired from the

ork Press has presented (o its readers  
the very words of the report that Wash­  
ington’s secretary made in bis private  
diary at the time.  
On Thursday, December 12, the general  
rode out to his farm about 10 oo’clock, and  
did not return home till past 3. Soon  
sfter he went out the weather became very  
bad--rain, hail and snow falling altern­  
ately, with a cold wind,  
When he came in I carried some letters  
to him to frank, intending to send them  
to the postotlice in the evening. He  
franked the letters, but said the weather  
was too bad to send a servant to the otlice  
that evening.  
I observed to him that I was afreid he  
had ﬁOt wet. He said no his great coat  
had kept him dry. But his neck appear­  
ed to be wet and the snow was banging  
upon his hair.  
A heavy fall of rnow took place on Fri­  
day, which prevented the geueral from  
riding out as usual. He hed a hoarseness  
which increased in the evening, but he  
made light of it.  
  
In the evenln%the papers were brought  
from the Eocto ce, and he rat in the  
parlor with Mrs. Wasthington and myself,  
readhw them till about ¥ o’clock, when  
Mrs. W, went up into Mrs, Lewis’ room,  
who was confined in childbed, and left  
the general and myself reading (he papers.  
He was very cheerful, and when he  
met with anything interesting or enter­  
taining he read it aloud as well as his  
hoarseness would permit him,  
He requested me to read to him the de­  
bates of the Virginia Assemlby on the  
election of a Senator and a Governor; and  
on hearing Mr. Madison’s observations  
suspecting Mr. Monroe, he appeared  
much affected, and spoke with some de­  
gree of asperity on the subject, which |  
endeavored to moderate, as I always do  
on such occasions.  
  
Between 2 and 3 o’clock on Saturday  
mornlng. he awoke Mrs. Washingtgn,  
and told her he was very unwell, and  
bhad had an ague. She observed that he  
counld scarcely spesk, and breathed with  
difficulty, and would have got up to call  
a servant, but be would not permit ler  
lest she should take cold.  
  
As soon as the day appeared the woman  
(L‘arollne&amp;awem into the room to make a  
th&#x27;ea and Mrs. Washington sent her im­  
mediately to eall me,  
1 got ur, put my clothes on as quickly  
ns possible, and went to his chamber,  
Washington was then up, and related to  
me his belng taken 111, as before stated,  
He desired that Mr. Rawlings (one of  
the overseers) might be sent for to bleed  
him before the doctor could arrive, 1 dis­  
patched a&#x27;servant instantly for Rawlins  
and another for Dr. Craik, and returmti  
again to the general’s ctamber, where 7  
found him in the same situation as |  
bad left him. A mixture of molasses,  
vine%nr and butter was pregnred to try  
its effects on the throat, but he could not  
swallow a drop; whenever he attempted  
it he appeared to pe distressed, convelsed  
and almost suffocated. Rawunﬁs came in  
soon after sunrise and prepared to bleed  
him. When the arm was rcady the gen­  
eral, observing that Rawlings appeared  
to be agitated, laid, as well as he could  
speak, **Don’t be afraid,”” and after the  
incision was made he observed: ‘‘lhe  
orifice is not lnrﬁe enough.”’  
However, the blood ran pretty freely  
Mrs, Wusb‘ngston, not knowing whether  
bleodinf was proper or not in the [l;en­  
eral’s situation, hm;?od that much might  
not be taken from him lest it should be  
injurious, and desired me to stop it, but  
when 1 was about to untie the string the  
general put up his hand to prevent it,  
and es soon as he could speak said:  
**More, more.”” Mrs. Washington bein  
still uneasy lest too much rlood uhoulg  
te taken, it was stopped after taking  
about l_mh a pint. TR 35 :  
  
In the meantime, before Dr., Craik  
arrived, Mr. Washington] desired me to  
gend for Dr. Brown of Port Tobhacco,  
whom Dr, Craik had recommended to be  
called it any case should ever occur that  
was seriously alarming. 1 dispatched a  
messenger (Cyrus) immediateiy for Dr,  
Brown between 8 and 9 o’clock.  
  
Dr. Craik came insoon after and upon  
examining the general he put a blister of  
cantharides on the throat, took some  
more blood from him, and had a gargle  
of vinegar ana sage tea and ordered some  
vinegar and hot water {or him to inhale  
the steam, which he aid. Eut in at­  
tempting to use the gargle he was almost  
suffocated,  
  
About 11 o’clock Dr. Craik requested  
that Dr. Dick might be sent for, as he  
feared Dr. Brown would not come in  
time. A messenger was accordingly dis­  
patched for him. About this time the  
general was bled again, i  
  
vr. Dick came in about 3 o’clock sand  
Dr. Brown arrived soon after, Upon Dr,  
Diek*sFeeng the general and consulting  
a few minutey with Dr. Craik he was bled  
again, Dr. Brown c¢ame inio the cham­  
ber soon after, and upon fee&#x27;ing the gen­  
eral’s pulse, etc., the physicians went out  
toget her,  
About 4:30 o’cléck he desired me to call  
Mrs. \Vnhln%ton to his bedside, when  
he requested her to go down into his  
room and take from his desk two wills  
which she would tind there and bring  
them to him, which «he did.  
U’pon looking at them he gave har one  
which he observed was uscless, as being  
superseded by the other, and desired her  
to burn it, whieh she did, ard took the  
other and put it into her closet,  
Aster this was done | returned to bis  
bedslide and took his hand. He said to  
me:  
  
“[find T am fo!ug; my bresth ecannot  
last long. 1 believed from the first that  
this disorder would p rove fatal. Do yon  
arrange and record all my late military  
letters and papers. Arrange my accounts  
and settle my books, #8 you know more  
about them than any one else,and jet Mr,  
Rawlins finish recording my other letiers  
which he had begun.” .  
1 told bim that this should be done.  
He ¢ten asked me if 1 recollected any­  
thing which it was essential for him to  
do, as he had but a very shot time to  
continue among us,  
I told him 1 could recollect nothing,  
but thet I hoped he was not so near his  
end. He observed, smiling, that he cer­  
tainly was, and that as it was the de&#x27;t  
that all must pc{v he looked to the event  
with perfeet resignation.  
He appeared penetrated with gratitude  
for my attentions, and often said: ““I am  
afraia 1 shall fatigue you too mueb,’”” and  
upon my assuring bim that I could feel  
nothing but a wish (o give him ease, he  
repliedr ‘‘Well, it &#x27;s a debt we must all  
pay to each othr, and | hope when you  
‘\:I’I! want aid of this kind you will find  
About 5 o&#x27;clock Dr. Cralk came intothe  
room and :pon going to (he bedside the  
general said to bim:  
‘“Doctery, 1 die hard, bnt I am not  
afrald togo. 1 believed from my first  
attack that I conld not survive it; my  
breath eannot last Jong.”’ The doctor  
presced his hand, but could not utter a  
word. He retired from the bedside and  
eat by the fire absorbed In grief,  
Between 5 and 8 o’cloek Dr. Dick and  
r. Brown eame into the reom. and with  
Dr. Craik went to toe bed. When Dr,

‘I feel myself going; I thank you for  
your attentions, but I pray you to take  
no more trouble about me; let me go off  
quietly. I cannot last long,”’  
They feared that all which had been  
done was without eflfect., He lay down  
again and all retired except Dr.Craik.

posed the day before) and complained of a  
sere throat: he, however, went out in the  
afternoon into the ground between the  
house and the river to mark some trees  
which were to be cut down in the im­  
provement of that spot. He had a hoarse­  
ness, which increased in the evening, but  
he made light of it. In the evening the  
papers were brought from the postoffice,  
an^-h&#x27;e&amp;fli4*in the parlor, with Mrs Wash­  
ington and myself, reading them till about  
ft o&#x27;clock, when/Mrs. W. went up into Mis.  
Lewie&#x27; room, who was confined&quot; in child­  
lied, and left the general and myself read­  
ing the papers. He was very cheerful,  
and when he met with anything interest­  
ing or entertaining he read it aloud as  
well as his hoarseness would permit him.  
He requested me to read to him the de­  
bates of the Virginia Assembly on the  
election of a senator and a governor and  
on healing Mr. Madison&#x27;s observations  
suspecting Mr. Monroe he appeared much  
affected, and spoke with some degree of  
asperity on the subject, which I endeav­  
ored to moderate, a  
a I always did on such  
occasions. On his retiring I observed to  
him that he had better take something to  
remove his cold. He answered no, &quot;You  
know I never take any/thing from a cold.  
Let it go as it came.&quot;  
  
Between 2 and o&#x27;clock on Saturday  
morning he awoke Mrs. Washington, and  
told her he was very unwell, and Irad had  
an ague. She observed that he could  
scarcely speak, and breathed with difficul­  
ty. and would have got up to call a serv­  
ant, but he would not permit her-lest she  
should take cold. As soon as the day  
appeared the woman (Caroline) went into  
1he room to make a. fire, and Mrs. Wash­  
ington seii&#x27;t her immediately to call me.  
got up, put on my clothes as quickly as  
possible, and went to his chamber. Wash­  
ington was then up. and related to me his  
being taken ill, as before stated. I found  
the genera,1 &#x27;breathing with difficulty, and  
hardly able to utter a word intelligibly.  
He desired that Mr. Rawlings (one of the  
overseers) might be semt for to bleed him  
before the doctor could arrive. I dis­  
patched a servant, instantly for Rawlings.  
and another for Dr. Craik, and returned  
flgain to the general&#x27;s chamber, where I  
found him in the same situation as I had  
left him. A mixture of molasses, vine­  
gar, and butter was prepared to try its  
effects on the throat but he could not  
swallow a drop whenever he- attempted it  
he appeared to be distressed, eonvulsed,  
land almost suffocated. Rawlings came in  
soon after sunrise and prepared to bleed  
him. When the arm was ready the gen­  
eral, observing that Rawlings appeared to  
be agitated, said, as weii as he could  
speak, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot; and after the in­  
cision was made he observed: &quot;The ori­  
fice is not large enough.&quot; However, the  
blood ra.n pretty freely. Mrs. Washing­  
ton, not. knowing whether bleeding was  
proper or not in the general&#x27;s situation,  
begged that much might not be taken  
from him. lest it should be injurious, and  
desired me to stop it but when I was  
about to untie the string, the general put  
up his hand to prevent it, end as soon as  
he could speak, said &quot;.More, more.&quot; Mrs.  
Washington being still uneasy lest too  
much blood should be taken, it was  
stopped after (taking about half a pint.  
Finding that no relief was obtained from  
bleeding, and thalt nothing would go down  
the throat, I proposed bathing it exter­  
nally with salvolatila, which was done,­  
and in the operation, which was with the  
hand, aind in the gentlest manner, he ob­  
served: &#x27;Tis very ssre.&quot; A piece of  
flannel dipped in salvolatila was put  
around his neck- and his feet bathed in  
warm water, but without affording any  
relief.  
  
In the meantime, before Dr. Craik ar­  
rived. Mrs. Washington desired me to  
send for Dr. Brown,. of Port Tobacco,  
whom Dr. Craik had recommended to be  
called if any case should ever oectir that  
was seriously alarming I dir patched a mes­  
senger (Cyrus) i-mmedvately for Dr. Brown  
(between 8 and 9 o&#x27;clock). Dr. Craik  
earns to aoon after., and upon examining  
the generalrhe put a bHster of cantharides  
cm the throat, took some&#x27;tnore blood from  
lum. fnd had a gargle of vinegaF and sage  
ordered softie vinegar and hot  
ttKMr for him 110 tahale the atefttt, which  
  
ft  
  
he did. But in attempting to use the  
gargle he was almost suffocated.  
When the gargle came frcm his throat  
some phlegm followed it a.nd he attempted  
to cough, which the doctor encouraged  
him to dp as much as possible, but he  
could only attempt it. About 11 o&#x27;clock  
Dr. Craik requested that Dr. Dick might  
bo sent for, as he feared Dr. Brown would  
not come in time. A messenger was ac­  
cordingly dispatched for him. About this  
timo the general was bled again. No ef­  
fect, however, was produced by it, and he  
remained in the same state, unable to  
swallow anything. A blister was admin­  
istered asbouit 12 o&#x27;clock, which produced  
an evacuation, but caused no alteration in  
his complaint.  
  
Dr. Dick came in about 3 o&#x27;clock and  
Dr. Brown arrived soon, after. Upon Dr.  
Dick&#x27;s seeing the general and consulting  
a few minutea with Dr. Craik he was bled  
again. The blood came very slow, was  
thick, and did not produce any symptoms  
of faintimg. Dr. Brown came into the  
chamber soon after, and upon feeling the  
general&#x27;s pulse, etc., the physicians went  
out together. Dr. Craik returned soon  
after. The general could now swallow a  
little. Calomel and tartar em. were ad­  
ministered, but without effect.  
  
About half past 4 o&#x27;clock he desired me  
to call Mrs. Washington to his bedside,  
when he requested her to go down into his  
room and take from his desk two wills  
which she would find there and bring  
them to him, which she did. Upon look­  
ing at them hei gave her one. which he ob­  
served was useless, as being superseded  
by the other, and desired her to burn it,  
which she did, and took the other and put  
it into her closet.  
  
After this was done I returned to his  
bedside and took his hand. He said .to  
me  
&quot;I find I am going, my breath cannot  
last long. I believed from the first that  
this disorder would prove fatal Do you  
arrange and second my late military let­  
ters a nd papers. Arrange my accounts  
and settle my books, as you know more  
about them than any one else, and let  
Mr. Rawlins finish recording my other let­  
ters which he had begun.&quot;  
  
I told him that this should be done. He  
then asked me if I recollected anything  
which i&#x27;t was essential for hiim to do, as he  
had but a very short time to continue  
among us. I told him I could recollect  
nothing but that I hoped he was not so  
near &#x27;his ewd He observed, .smiling, that  
he certainly was, and that as it was the  
debt that all must pay he looked to the  
event with perfect resignation.  
  
In the course of the afternoon he ap­  
peared to be great pain a,nd distress  
from the difficulty of breathing, and fre­  
quently changed his position in the. bed.  
On these occasions I lay iipcn the bed and  
endeavored to raise him and turn, him  
with as much care as possible.  
  
He appeared penetrated with gratitude  
for my attentions and often said: &quot;I am  
afraid I shall fatigue you too much,&quot; and  
upon my assuring him that I could feel  
nothing but a wish to give him ease, he  
replied: &quot;Well, it i3 a debt we must all  
pay to each other, and I hope when you  
will want aid of this kind you will find it,&quot;  
  
He asked when Mr. Lewis and Wash­  
ington Curtis would return (they were in  
New Kent). I told&#x27;him about the 29t&#x27;h of  
the mont&#x27;h.  
  
About 5 o&#x27;clock Dr. Craik ca.me into the  
room, and u$on going to the bedside tlhe  
general said to him: &quot;Doctor, I die hard  
but I am not afraid to go I believed from  
my first attack that I should not survive  
it my breath cannot last long/&#x27; The don­  
tor pressed his hand, but could not utter  
a word. He retired from the bedside and  
sat by the fire absorbed in grief.  
  
Between 5 and 6 o&#x27;clock Dr. Dick and  
Dr. Craik went to the bed wheoi Dr. Craik  
asked him if he could sit up in the bed he  
held out his band and I raised him up.  
  
He than said to the physicians: &quot;I feel  
myself going I .thank you fcr your atten­  
tions but I pray you to take no more  
trouble about me: lot me go off quietly I  
caninot last long.&quot; They feared that all  
which had been done waa without effect  
he laid down again and all retired except  
Dr. Craik. He continued in the same sit­  
uation, uneasy and restless, but without  
complaining, frequently asking what hour  
it was. When I helped him to move at  
this time he did .not speak, but looked at  
me with strong expressions of gratitude.  
  
At about 8 o&#x27;clock the physicians came  
again into the room and applied blisters  
and cataplasms of wheat bran to his legs  
and feet, after which they went out (ex­  
cept Dr. Craik) without a my of hope. I  
went out about this time and wrote a line  
to Mr. Law and Mr. Peter, requesting  
•them to come with their wives, Mrs.  
Washington&#x27;s granddaughters, as ecpn as  
possible to Mount Vernon. About 10  
o&#x27;clock he made several attempts to speak  
to «ne before he could effect it. At length  
he sa.id:  
&quot;I am just going have me decently  
buried, and do not let my body be put into  
the vault in less than three days after I  
am dead.&quot;  
  
I bowed assent, for I could net speak.  
He then looked at me again and said, &quot;Do  
you understand me?&quot; I replied., &quot;Yes.&quot;  
&#x27;Tis well,&quot; said he. About, ten minutes  
before he expired (which was between 10  
and 11 o&#x27;clock) {lis breathing became eas­  
ier: he.lay quietly he withdrew his hand  
from mine and felt his own pulse.  
  
I saw his countenance change. -I spoke  
to Dr. Craik, who sat by the fire. He,  
came to the, bedside. The general&#x27;s hand  
fell from his wrist. I took it in mine and  
put it in my bosom.  
  
Dr. Craik put his hands over his eyes,  
and really he expired without a struggle  
or a sigh.  
  
While we were filled with silent grief  
Mrs Washington, who was sitting at the  
foot of tihe bed, asked with a firm and col­  
lected voice, &quot;Is he gone?&quot; I could not  
speak, but held up my hand as a signal  
that he wtas no more.  
&#x27;Tis well,&quot; said she in the some voice.  
&quot;All is now over. I shall soon follow him.  
I have no more trials to pass through.&quot;

Night.”— Washington’s Diary.  
  
“On Thursday, December 12, the General rode out to his farms about ten  
o’clock, and did not return home till past three. Soon after he went out,  
the weather became very bad, rain, hail, snow falling alternately, with a  
cold wind. When he came in, I carried some letters to him to frank, in-  
tending to send them to the post-office in the evening. He franked the  
letters, but said the weather was too bad to send a servant to the office that  
evening. I observed to him, that I was afraid he had got wet. He said,  
No, his great-coat had kept him dry. But his neck appeared to be wet, and  
the snow was hanging upon his hair. He came to dinner (which had been  
waiting for him) without changing his dress. In the evening he appeared  
as well as usual.””&quot;—Topras Lear. (Sparks, Vol. I. p. 555.)

(undoubtedly from being so much exposed  
the day before), and complained of a  
sore throat. He however went out in the  
afternoon into the ground between the  
house and the river to mark some trees  
which were to be cut down in the improve-  
ment of that spot. He had a hoarseness,  
which increased in the evening, but he  
made light of it. In the evening the  
papers were brought from the post-office,  
and he sat in the parlor, with Mrs. Wash-  
ington and myself, reading them till about  
nine o’clock, when Mrs. Washington went  
up into Mrs. Lewis’s room, who was con-  
fined in childbed, and left the General and  
myself reading the papers. He was very  
cheerful, and whenever he met with any-  
thing interesting or entertaining, he read  
it aloud as well as his hoarseness would  
permit him.  
  
He requested me to read to him the de-  
bates of the Virginia Assembly on the elec-  
tion of a Senator and a Governor; and,  
on hearing Mr. Madison’s observations  
respecting Mr. Monroe, he appeared much  
affected, and spoke with some degree of  
asperity on the subject; which I endeav-  
ored to moderate, as I always did on such  
occasions. On his retiring I observed to  
him that he had better take something to  
remove his cold. Heanswered: ‘* No; you  
know I never take anything for a cold.  
Let it go as it came.”’  
  
Between two and three o’clock on Sat-  
urday morning, he awoke Mrs. Washing-  
ton and told her he was very unwell and  
had had an ague. She observed that he  
could scarcely speak and breathed with  
difficulty; and would have got up to calla  
servant, but he would not permit her, lest  
she should take cold.  
  
As soon as the day appeared, the woman  
(Caroline) went into the room to make  
a fire, and Mrs. Washington sent her  
immediately to call me. I got up,-put on  
my clothes as quickly as possible, and  
went to his chamber. Mrs. Washington  
was then up, and related to me his being  
taken ill, as before stated.  
  
I found the General breathing with diffi-  
culty and hardly able to utter a word in-  
telligibly. He desired that Mr. Rawlins  
(one of the overseers) might be sent for  
to bleed him before the doctors could ar-  
rive. I despatched a servant instantly for  
Rawlins and another for Dr. Craik, and  
returned again to the General’s chamber,  
where I found him in the same situation as  
I had left him.  
  
A mixture of molasses, vinegar, and  
butter was prepared to try its effect in the  
  
THE LAST DAYS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON:  
  
  
  
throat, but he could not swallow a drop.  
Whenever he attempted it, he appeared  
to be distressed, convulsed, and almost  
suffocated. Rawlins came in soon after  
sunrise, and prepared to bleed him. When  
the arm was ready the General, observing  
that Rawlins appeared to be agitated,  
said, as well as he could speak, ‘* Don’t  
be afraid,’’ and, after the incision was  
made, he observed, ‘* The orifice is not  
large enough.’’  
  
However, the blood ran pretty freely.  
Mrs. Washington, not knowing whether  
bleeding was proper or not in the General’s  
situation, begged that much might not be  
taken from him, lest it should be injurious,  
and desired me to stop it. But when I  
was about to untie the string, the General  
put up his hand to prevent it, and, as soon  
as he could speak, said: ‘* More, more.’’  
Mrs. Washington, being still very uneasy  
lest too much blood should be taken, it  
was stopped after taking about half a  
pint.  
  
Finding that no relief was obtained from  
bleeding and that nothing would go down  
the throat, I proposed bathing it externally  
with *‘ salvi latila,’’ which was done; and  
in the operation, which was with the hand  
and in the gentlest manner, he observed,  
““*Tis very sore.’’ &lt;A piece of flannel  
dipped in “‘ salvi latila’’ was put around his  
neck and his feet bathed in warm water;  
but without affording any relief.  
  
In the meantime, before Dr. Craik ar-  
rived, Mrs. Washington desired me to send  
for Dr. Brown of Port Tobacco, whom  
Dr. Craik had recommended to be called,  
if any case should ever occur that was  
seriously alarming.  
  
I despatched a messenger (Cyrus) imme-  
diately for Dr. Brown (between eight and  
nine o’clock), Dr. Craik came in soon  
after, and, upon examining the General, he  
put a blister of cantharides on the throat,  
took some more blood from him, and had  
a gargle of vinegar and sage tea ordered,  
and some vinegar and hot water for him to  
inhale the steam, which he did; but in at-  
tempting to use the gargle he was almost  
suffocated.  
  
When the gargle came from his throat  
some phlegm followed it, and he attempted  
to cough, which the doctor encouraged  
him to do as much as possible, but he  
could only attempt it.  
  
About eleven o’clock Dr. Craik re-  
quested that Dr. Dick might be sent for,  
as he feared Dr. Brown would not come in  
time. A messenger was accordingly de-

Dr. Dick’s seeing the General, and consult-  
ing a few minutes with Dr. Craik, he was  
bled again; the blood came very slow, was  
thick, and did not produce any symptoms  
of fainting. Dr. Brown came into the  
chamber soon after, and upon feeling the  
General’s pulse, etc., the physicians went  
out together. Dr. Craik returned soon  
  
  
  
  
  
318  
after. The General could now swallow a  
little. Calomel and tartar emetic were  
  
administered; but without any effect.  
  
About half-past four o’clock, he desired  
me to call Mrs. Washington to his bedside,  
when he requested her to go down into his  
room and take from his desk two wills  
which she would find there and bring  
them to him, which she did. Upon look-  
ing at them he gave her one, which he  
observed was useless, as being superseded  
by the other, and desired her to burn it,  
which she did, and took the other and put  
it into her closet.  
  
After this was done I returned to his bed-  
side and took his hand. He said tp me:  
  
“‘T find I am going; my breath can  
not last long. I believed from the first  
that this disorder would prove fatal. Do  
you arrange and record all my late military  
letters and papers, arrange my accounts,  
and settle my books, as you know more  
about them than any one else, and let Mr.  
Rawlins finish recording my other letters,  
which he has begun.”’  
  
I told him this should be done. He  
then asked if I recollected anything which  
it was essential for him to do, as he had but  
a very short time to continue among us.  
I told him I could recollect nothing, but  
that I hoped he was not so near his end.  
He observed, smiling, that he certainly  
was, and that as it was a debt which all  
must pay, he looked to the event with  
perfect resignation.  
  
In the course of the afternoon he ap-  
peared to be in great pain and distress  
from the difficulty of breathing, and fre-  
quently changed his posture in the bed.  
On these occasions I lay upon the bed  
and endeavored to raise him and turn him  
with as much care as possible. He ap-  
peared penetrated with gratitude for my  
attentions, and often said, ‘‘ I am afraid I  
shall fatigue you too much; ’’ and upon my  
assuring him that I could feel nothing but  
a wish to give him care, he replied: ‘* Well,  
it is a debt we must pay to each other, and  
I hope when you want aid of this kind  
vou will find it.”’  
  
He asked me when Mr. Lewis and Wash-  
ington Custis would return (they were in  
New Kent). I told him about the 2oth of  
the month.  
  
About five o’clock Dr. Craik came again  
into the room, and, upon going to the bed-  
side, the General said to him:  
  
‘Doctor, I die hard; but I am not  
afraid to go. I believed from my first at-  
tack that I should not survive it; my  
breath can not last long.’’

The doctor pressed his hand, but could  
not utter a word. He retired from the  
bedside, and sat by the fire absorbed in  
grief.  
  
Between five and six o’clock, Dr. Dick  
and Dr. Brown came into the room, and  
with Dr. Craik went to the bed, when Dr.  
Craik asked him if he could sit up in the  
bed. He held out his hand, and I raised  
him up. He then said to the physicians:  
‘*T feel myself going. I thank you for  
your attentions; but | pray you to take no  
more trouble about me; let me go off  
quietly; I can not last long.”’  
  
They found that all which had been  
done was without effect; he lay down  
again, and all retired except Dr. Craik.  
He continued in the same situation, un-  
easy and restless, but without complain-  
ing, frequently asking what hour it was.  
When I helped him to move at this time,  
he did not speak, but looked at me with  
strong expressions of gratitude.  
  
About eight o’clock the physicians  
came again into the room, and applied  
blisters and cataplasms of wheat bran to  
his legs and feet, after which they went  
out (except Dr. Craik) without a ray of  
hope.  
  
I went out about this time and wrote a  
line to Mr. Law and Mr. Peter, requesting  
them to come with their wives (Mrs. Wash-  
ington’s granddaughters), as soon as pos-  
sible, to Mount Vernon.  
  
About ten o’clock he made several at-  
tempts to speak to me before he could  
effect it. At length he said: ‘‘I am just  
going; have me decently buried, and do  
not let my body be put irto the vault in  
less than three days after I am dead.”’  
  
I bowed assent, for I could not speak.  
He then looked at me again and said:  
** Do you understand me?”’  
  
I replied, ‘‘ Yes.’”’  
  
‘**Tis well,’’ said he.  
  
About ten minutes before he expired  
(which was between ten and eleven  
o’clock) his breathing became easier; he  
lay quietly; he withdrew_his hand from  
mine, and felt his own pulse. I saw his  
countenance change. I spoke to Dr.  
Craik, who sat by the fire. He came to  
the bedside. ‘The General’s hand fell from  
his wrist. I took it in mine, and put it into  
my bosom. Dr. Craik put his hands over  
his eyes. And he expired without a strug-  
gle or a sigh.  
  
While we were fixed in silent grief, Mrs.  
Washington (who was sitting at the foot  
of the bed) asked, with a firm and col-  
lected voice, ‘‘ Is he gone ?’’

d  
  
it  
of  
  
in  
  
al  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
I could not speak, but held up my hand  
as a signal that he was no more.  
  
**’Tis well,’’ said she, in the same  
voice; ‘‘ all is now over, and I shall soon  
follow him. Ihave no more trials to pass  
through.”’  
  
» Occurrences not noted in the preceding  
narrative :  
  
The General’s servant, Christopher,  
was in the room through the day, and in  
the afternoon the  
General directed  
him to sit down, as  
he had been stand-  
ing almost the  
whole day. He  
did so.  
  
About eight  
o’clock in the  
morning he ex-  
  
pressed a desire  
to get up; his  
clothes were put  
  
on, and he _ was  
led to a chair by  
the fire; he found  
no relief from that  
position, and lay  
down again about  
ten o’clock.  
  
About five P.M.  
he was helped up  
again, and after  
sitting about half  
an hour, desired  
to be ‘undressed  
and put in bed,  
which was done.  
  
During his whole  
illness he spoke  
  
with great dif-  
ficulty and = dis-  
tress, and in so low and broken a voice as  
at times hardly to be understood. His  
patience, fortitude, and resignation never  
forsook him for a moment. In all his dis-  
tress he uttered not a sigh nor a complaint,  
always endeavoring (from a sense of duty,  
as it appeared) to take what was offered  
him and to do as he was desired by his  
physicians.  
  
At the time of his decease, Dr. Craik  
and myself were in the situation before-  
mentioned; Mrs. Washington was sitting  
near the foot of the bed;

cember 14. 1799, Mr. Lear writes as  
follows:  
* * * &quot;A heavy fall of snow took  
place on Friday, which prevented the  
General from riding out as usual. He  
had taken cold (undoubtedly from be­  
ing so much exposed the day before),  
and complained of a sore throat. He,  
however, went out in the afternoon in­  
to the ground between the house and  
the river to mark some trees which  
were to be cut down in the improve­  
ment of that spot. He had a hoars?­  
neBS which increased in the evening,  
but he made light of it. In the  
evening the papers were brought from  
the post-office, and he sat in the par­  
lor with Mrs. Washington and myself  
reading them until about 9 o&#x27;clock,  
when Mrs. Washington went up into  
Mrs. Lewis&#x27; room, who was confined  
in child bed, and left the Genera1 and  
myself reading the papers. He was  
very cheerful and when he met with  
anything interesting or entertaining,  
he read it aloud as well as his hoarse­  
ness would permit him.  
The writer goes on to say that the  
General was particularly interested  
and appeared much affected when he  
read to him Mr. Madison&#x27;s observa­  
tions respecting Mr. Monroe. On re­  
tiring he suggested the advisability  
of taking something to, remove the  
cold, when Washington said, &quot;No;  
you know I never take anything for a  
cold. Let it go as it came.&quot;  
* * * &quot;Between 2 and 3 o&#x27;clock on  
Saturday morning he awoke Mrs.  
Washington and told her he was very  
unwell and had had an ague. She ob­  
served that he could scarcely speak,  
and breathed with difficulty; and  
would have got hp to call a servant,  
but he would not permit her lest she  
should take cold.&quot;  
&quot;As noon as day appeared Mrs.  
Washington sent the maid to call the  
writer, and on dressing hurriedly and  
going into the General&#x27;s chamber, he  
says:  
&quot;I found the General breathing  
with difficulty and hardly able to ut­  
ter a word intelligibly. He desired  
that Mr. Rawlins (one of the over­  
seers) might be sent for to bleed him  
before the doctors could arrive. I  
dispatched a servant instantly for  
Rawlins and another for Dr. Craik,  
and returned again to the General&#x27;s  
chamber, where 1 found him in the  
same situation as I had left him.  
&quot;A mixture of molasses, vinegar  
and butter was prepared to try its ef­  
fect in the throat, but he could not  
swallow a drop. Whenever he at­  
tempted it he appeared to be dis  
tressed, convulsed and almost suffo­  
cated. Rawlins came in soon after  
sunrise and prepared to bleed him.  
When the arm was ready, the General,  
observing that Rawlins appeared to be  
agitated, said, as well as he could  
speak. &#x27;Don&#x27;t be afraid&#x27;: and, after  
the incision was made, he observed,  
&#x27;The orifice is not large enough.&#x27;  
&quot;However, the blood ran pretty  
freely. Mrs. Washington, not know­  
ing whether bleeding was proper or  
not in the General&#x27;s situation, begged  
that much might not be taken from  
him lest it should be injurious, and  
desired me to stop it. Hut when I  
was about to untie the string the (?en­  
crai put out his hand to prevent itand  
as soon as he could speak said: &#x27;More,  
more.&#x27; Mrs. Washington being still  
very uneasy lest too much blood  
should be taken, it was stopped after  
taking about half a pint.  
&quot;Finding that no relief was ob­  
tained from bleeding, and that noth­  
ing would go down the throat. 1 pro­  
posed bathing it externally with &#x27;salvi  
latila,&#x27; which was done: and in the  
operation, which was with the hand  
and in the gentlest manner, he ob­  
served, &quot;Tis very sore.&#x27; A piece of  
flannel dipped in &#x27;salvi latila1 was put  
around his neck, and his feet bathed  
in warm water, but without affording  
any relief.  
&quot;In the meantime, before Dr. Craik  
arrived, Mrs. Washington desired nie  
to send for Dr. Brown, of Port Tobac­  
co, whom Dr. Craik had recommended  
to b?* called if any case should ever  
occnr that was seriously alarming.  
&quot;1 dispatched a messenger (Cyrus)  
immediately for Dr. Brown (between  
S and !? o&#x27;clock.) Dr. Craik came in  
soon after, and. upon cxaniing the  
General he put a blister of canthari­  
des upon the throat, took some more  
blood from him. and hot water for him  
to inhale the steam, which he did: but  
in attempting to use the gargle he was  
almost suffocated.  
&quot;Aboul 11 o&#x27;clock Dr. &lt; &#x27;rail; sug­  
gc &gt;h &lt;! that Dr. Dick might he sent for.  
as he feared Dr. !&gt;ro\vn would not  
come in time. A messenger was ac­  
cordingly dispatched far him. About 1  
  
this time the General was bled again:  
no effect was, however, produced by  
it, and he remained in the same state,  
unable to swallow anything.  
&quot;A blister was administered about  
12 o&#x27;clock, which * :f * caused no al­  
teration in his complaint.  
&quot;Dr. Dick came in about 3 o&#x27;clock,  
and Dr. Brown arrived soon after.  
Upon Dr. Dick&#x27;s seeing the General  
and consulting a few moments with  
Dr. Craik, he was bled again: the  
blood eame very slow, was thick, and  
did not produce any symptoms of  
fainting. Dr. Brown came into the  
chamber soon after, and upon feeling  
the General&#x27;s pulse, the physicians  
went out together. Dr. Craik returned  
soon after. The General could now  
swallow a little. Calomel and tartar  
emetic were administered, but without  
effect.&quot;  
It seems that the General had a  
presentiment of the result from  
the first. About the middle  
of the afternoon he called Mrs.  
Washington to his bedside, and in­  
structed her concerning his last will.  
He also requested that all of his ac­  
counts, letters and papers be ar­  
ranged; he then asked the writer &quot;if  
I could recollect anything that it was  
essential for him to do, as he had but  
a very short time to continue among  
us.&quot; On being remonstrated with,  
he smilingly observed that &quot;it was a  
debt which all must pay&quot; and that he  
looked to the event with &quot;perfect  
resignation.&quot; He suffered great pain  
and distress in the course of the af­  
ternoon from the difficulty in breath­  
ing and continued restless and un

&quot;I feel myself going. I thank you  
for your attentions; but I pray you  
take no more trouble about me; let me  
go quietly; I ?aunot last long. He  
continued uneasy and restless, but un­

&quot;About 8 o&#x27;clock the physicians

&quot;About 10 minutes before he ex­

he lay quietly; he withdrew his hand

to Dr. Craik, who sat by the fire. He  
came to the bedside. The General&#x27;s

cember 14, 17!W, Mr. Lear writes as  
follows:  
* * * &#x27;&#x27;A heavy fall of snow took  
place on Friday, which prevented the  
General from riding out as usual. He  
had taken cold (undoubtedly from be­  
ing so much exposed the day before),  
and complained of a sore throat. He,  
however, nt&#x27;iii Out ni tuC kft???OOD ?O*

the river to mark some trees which  
were to be cut down in the improve­  
ment O* tout Spot. Hu hud a uuur?c­  
ness which increased in the evening,  
but he made light of it. In thc  
evening the papers were brought from  
the post-office, and he sat in the par­  
lor with Mrs. Washington and myself  
reading them until about !? o&#x27;clock,  
when Mrs. Washington went up into  
Mrs. Lewis&#x27; room, who was confined  
in child bcd, and left the General and  
myself reading thc papers. He was

&quot;On Thursday, Dec. 12, the General rode out to  
his farms about 10 o&#x27;clock, and did not return home  
until past 3. Soon after he went out the weather  
became very bad, rain, hail, snow, falling alter­  
nately, with a cold wind. I carried some letters  
to him to frank, intending to send them to the Post  
Office in the evening. He franked the letters but  
said the weather was too bad to send a servant to  
the office that evening. I observed to him  
that I was afraid he had got wet. He said,  
No, his great coat had kept him dry. But his  
neck appeared to be wet and the snow was hang  
ng upon his hair. He came to dinner (which  
had been waiting for him) without changing his  
dress. In the evening he appeared as well as  
usual.  
 heavy fall of snow took place on Friday,  
which prevented the General from riding out as  
usual. He had taken cold, undoubtedly from  
being so much exposed the day before, and com­  
plained of a sore throat. He, however, went in  
the afternoon into the ground between the house  
and the river to mark some trees which were to be  
cut down in the improvement of that spot. He  
had a hoarseness, which increased in the evening,  
but he made light of it  
&quot;In the evening the papers were brought from  
the Post Office, and he sat in the parlor with Mrs.  
Washingion and myself reading them till about  
Wo&#x27;clock, when Mrs. Washington went up into  
Mrs. Lewis&#x27;s room, who was confined, and left the  
General and myself reading the papers. He  
was very cheerful, and when he met with any­  
thing interesting or entertaining he read it aloud  
as well as his hoarseness would permit. He  
requested me to read the debates of the Virginia  
ssembly on the election of a Senator and Gov  
ernor, and on hearing Mr. Madison&#x27;s observa­  
tions respecting Mr. Monroe, he appcared much  
affectet, and spoke with some degree of asperity  
on the subiect. On his retiring I observed to him  
that he had better take something to remove his  
coldille answered. &#x27;No, you know I never take  
anything for a cold. Let it go as it came.

ly all through the day. At 4120 in the  
afternoon he called his wife to his bed­  
side and told her where she would find  
two wills, one of which she was to de­  
stroy, the other to keep, a request she  
immediately complied with.  
Story of the SecretarY.  
&quot;After this was done,&quot; says Mr. Lear,  
&quot;I returned to his bedside and took his  
hand. He said to me: &#x27;I find I am going;  
my breath cannot last long. I belteved  
from the first that the disorder would  
prove fatal. Do you arrange and record  
all my late military letters and papers.  
Arrange my accounts and settle my books,  
as you know more about them than any  
one else, and let Mr. Rawlins finish re­  
cording my other letters which he has be­  
gun.&quot; I told him this should be done. He  
then asked if I could recollect anything  
which if was essential for him to do, as  
he had but a very short time to continue  
with us. I told him that I could recollect  
nothing which it was essential for him to  
do, but I hoped he was not so near his  
end. He observed, smiling, that he cer­  
tainly was, and that, as it was the debt  
which we must all pay, he looked to the  
event with perfect resignation.  
&quot;In the course of the afternoon he an­  
peared to be in great pain and distress  
from the difficulty of breathing, and fre­  
quently changed his posture in the bed,  
On these occasions I lay upon the bed  
and endeavored to raise him and turn him  
with as much ease as possible. He ap­  
peared penetrated with gratitude for my  
attentions and often said I am afraid I  
shall fatigue you too much,&quot; and upon my  
assuring him that I could feel nothing but  
a wish to give him ease, he replied:  
&quot;Well, it is a debt we must pay to each  
other, and I hope when you want aid of  
this kind you will find it.&quot;  
Not Afraid to GO.  
&quot;About 5 o&#x27;clock Dr. Craik came again  
into the room, and upon going to the bed­  
side the general said to him: Doctor, I  
die hard, but I am not afraid to go. I be­  
lieved from my first attack that I should  
not survive it. My breath cannot last  
long.&quot; The doctor pressed his hand, but  
could not utter a word. He retired from  
the bedside and sat by the fire, absorbed  
in grief.  
&quot;Between 5 and 6 o&#x27;clock Dr, Craik, Dr.  
Dick and Dr, Brown came again into the  
room and went to the bed, when Dr,  
Craik asked him if he could sit up in the  
hed. He held out his hand and I raised  
him up. He then said to the physicianst  
&quot;I feel myself going; I thank you for your  
attention, but I pray you to take no more  
trouble about me. Let me go off quietly.  
I cannot last long.&#x27; They found that all  
which had been done was without effect,  
He lay down again, and all retired except  
Dr. Craik. He continued in the same sit­  
uation, uneasy and restless, but without  
complaining, frequently asking what hour  
it was. When I helped him to move at  
this time he did not speak, but looked at  
me with strong expressions of gratitude.  
&quot;About 8 o&#x27;clock the physicians came  
again into the room and applied blisters  
and cataplasms of wheat bran to his legs  
and feet, after which they went out, ex­  
cept Dr. Craik, without a ray of hope. I

them to come with their wives (Mrs.

going. Have me decently buried, and do  
not let my body be put into the vault in  
less than three days after I am dead.&quot; I  
bowed assent, for I could not speak. He  
then looked at me again and said: &#x27;Do  
you understand me?&quot; I replied: &#x27;Yes.&quot;  
&quot;Tis well,&quot; said he.  
&quot;About ten minutes before he expired,  
which was between 10 and i1 o&#x27;clock, his  
breathing became easier. He lay quietly,  
he withdrew his hand from mine and folt  
his own pulse. I saw his countenarice  
change. I spoke to Dr. Craik, who sat by  
the fire. He came to the bedside. The  
general&#x27;s hand fell from his wrist, I took  
it in mine and pressed it to my bosom.  
Dr. Craik put his hand over his eyes and  
he expired without a struggle or a sigh,  
&quot;While we were fixed in silent grief  
Mrs. Washington, who was sitting at the  
foot of the bed, asked with a firm and col­  
lected voice: &#x27;Is he gone?&quot; I could not  
speak, but held up my hand as a signal  
that he was no more. &quot;Tis well,&#x27; said  
she in the same voice; &#x27;all is over now. I  
shall soon follow him, I have no more  
trials to pass through.&quot;  
&quot;During his whole illness,&quot; adds Mr.  
Lear, &quot;he spoke but seldom and with  
great difficulty and distress, and in so low  
and broken a voice as at times hardly to  
be understood. His patience, fortitude and  
resignation never forsook him for a me­
