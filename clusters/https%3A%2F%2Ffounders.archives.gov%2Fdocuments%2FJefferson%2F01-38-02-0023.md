Washington, July 6, 1802.  
Sir: I received in due time your favours of  
May 31st, and Juno 9, the former covering an  
address from a democratic republican meeting at  
Dover, the latter one from the grand and general  
juries of the Circuit Court of the U. States, held  
at Dover, both of them praying a removal of Al­  
len McLane from the office of Collector of the  
Customs at Wilmington.  
When I first came into the administration,  
complaints were exhibited against Col. M&#x27;Lane,  
and an inquiry immediately directed to be made  
into his conduct. Every opportunity which could  
be desired was given, on both sides, to the pro­  
ducing of testimony ; and on a very full investi­  
gation, he was finally acquitted) He had a right  
  
to consider that acquittal as a bar to every thing  
anterior,1 and certainly according to sound princi­  
ples , it must bo so considered. I am persuaded  
that the Republican citizens who have concurred  
in these addresses, would be as incapable of  
wishing me to do any thing which should bring a  
just censure on the administration, as I should be  
from yielding to such a wish. We have no in­  
terest or passions different from those of ourfellow-citizens.  
We have the same object, the  
success of representative government. Nor are  
we acting for ourselves done, but for the whole  
human race. The event of our experiment is to  
show whether man can be trusted withself-government.  
The eyes of suffering humanity are  
fixed on us with anxiety as their only hope, and  
on such a theatre, and for such a cause, wo must  
  
suppress all smaller passions and local considera  
  
uons. ihe leaders or ieueraiism say, mat man  
cannot be trusted with his own government. We  
  
must not, by any departure from principle, dis  
  
hearten the mass ot our fellow-citizens, who  
  
have confided to us this interesting cause. If,  
  
since the date of the acquittal, Col. M Lnne has  
  
done any new act inconsistent wnh his tut y as an  
  
officer, or as an agent of the administration, this  
  
would be h ffuimate ground for new inquiry, into  
  
which I should consider myself as free to enter  
  
No particular fact of this kind is charged in the  
addresses ; but only that he is disagreeable to the  
citizens of the place. This would be among the  
proper considerations on tho appointment of an  
  
officer,&#x27; and ought, before appointment, to have  
  
weight, but tofter many years possession of an of  
  
fice, and an exact discharge of its duties, removal  
for this reason would not be approved by those  
  
bcvoncJ the pale ot his unpopularity.  
  
Our opponents are so disposed to make a ma  
  
lignant use of whatever comes from me, to tor  
  
ture every word into meanings never intended, in  
  
order to veil their own passions and principles,  
  
that 1 must ask the lavour ot you to commum  
  
cate verbally the sentiments of this letter, to  
  
those whoforwaided their addresses through you,  
  
not permitting the letter or any copy to go out of

of my high consideration and respect.

&quot;Sm: I received in due lime your favors ol May  
31st, and Jut&gt;? 0, (he former covering an address from  
a drumciatu. republican meeting at Dover, the latter  
one from the grand and general juries of ihe circuit  
court of the United Staiea, hi Id at Dover, both of them  
praying a removal of Allen Mi-Lane from the office of  
collector of cuatoms at Wilmington.  
When 1 first came into the administration, complainta  
were exhibited against Col. Mcl&lt;ane, and an inquiry  
immediately directed to be made into his conduct.  
Every opportunity, which could be desired was given,  
011 bolh sides, 10 the producing of te?timonv ; and on a  
very full investigation, he was finally acquitted He  
bad a right to consider that acquittal sa a bar to everv  
thing anterior ; and certainly, according to aound prin­  
ciples, it must be ao considered, f am persuaded thai  
the republican cliixcn* who have concurred in these ad­  
dieasea, would be as incapable of wishing me to do any  
thing which should bring a just censure on the adminis­  
tration, as I should bo from yielding to such a wish  
We have no interest nor passions different from those  
of our fellow ciliseus. We have the same object, ihe  
auccess of representative government. Nor are we  
acting for ourselves alone, but for the whole human race.  
Tbe event of our experiment ia to ahow whether man  
can lie trusted with ?tdf-government. The eyes of suf­  
fering humanity aru fixed on us with anxiety aa their  
only hope, and on such a theatre and for such a caute,  
we suppri&#x27;sa all smaller passion and local considerationa.  
The leaders of federalism say, that man cannot be  
trusted with his own government. We must do no act  
which shall replsee them in the direction of the experi­  
ment. We must not, by any departure from principle,  
dishearten the mans of our fellow citizens who have  
confided to us this interesting cause.  
If, aince the date of tlie acquittal, Col. McLane haa  
done anv new act inconsistent with his duty as an offi­  
cer, or an agent of the adm lustration, (his would be  
legitimate ground fur new inquiry, into which I should  
consider myself as free to enter. No particular fact of  
this kind is charged 111 the address, but only ihst he is  
disagreeable to the citizens of the place. This would

I of an officer, and ought, before appointment to hive  
; weight, but after many years possession of an nffic.n,  
; and an exact discharge of its duties, removal fur this  
reason would not be approved by those beyond the palo  
of his unpopularity.  
Oar opponents arc so disposed to make a malignant

passions and principles, that I must ask the favor of you
