Col: Burr arrived first on the ground as had been previously agreed. When Genl Hamilton arrived the parties exchanged salutations and the Seconds proceeded to make their arrangments. They measured the distance, ten full paces, and cast lots for the choice of positions as also to determine by whom the word should be given, both of which fell to the Second of Genl Hamilton. They then proceeded to load the pistols in each others presence, after which the parties took their stations. The Gentleman who was to give the word, then explained to the parties the rules which were to govern them in firing which were as follows: The parties being placed at their stations The Second who gives the word shall ask them whether they are ready—being answered in the affirmative, he shall say “present” after which the parties shall present &amp; fire when they please. If one fires before the other the opposite second shall say one two, three, fire, and he shall fire or loose his fire. And asked if they were prepared, being answered in the affirmative he gave the word present as had been agreed on, and both of the parties took aim, &amp; fired in succession, the Intervening time is not expressed as the seconds do not precisely agree on that point. The pistols were discharged within a few seconds of each other and the fire of Col: Burr took effect; Genl Hamilton almost instantly fell. Col: Burr then advanced toward Genl H——n with a manner and gesture that appeared to Genl Hamilton’s friend to be expressive of regret, but without Speaking turned about &amp; withdrew. Being urged from the field by his friend as has been subsequently stated, with a view to prevent his being recognised by the Surgeon and Bargemen who were then approaching. No farther communications took place between the principals and the Barge that carried Col: Burr immediately returned to the City. We conceive it proper to add that the conduct of the parties in that interview was perfectly proper as suited the occasion.

Colonel Burr arrived firft on the ground, as had been previ.  
oufly agreed ; when General Hamilton arrived, the parties ex.  
changed falutations, and the feconds proceeded to make their ar-  
rangements, ‘They meafured the diftance, ten full paces, and  
caft lots for the choice of pofition, as alfo to determine by whom  
the word fhould be given, both of which fell to the fecond of  
Genera! Hamilton. They then proceeded to load the piftols in  
each other’s prefence, after which the parties took their ftations,  
The gentleman who was to give the word, then explained to the  
parties the rules which were to govern them in firing, which  
were as follows:—* The parties being placed at their ftations,  
the fecond who gives the word fhall afk them whether they are  
ready ; being anfwered in theaffirmative, he fhall fay * prefent,’  
after this the parties fhall prefent and fire when thev pleafe. If  
one fires before the other, the oppofite fecond fhall fay one, two,  
three, fire—and he fhall then fire or lofe his fire.”” He then  
afked if they were prepared ? Being anfwered in the aflirma-  
tive, he gave the word prefent, as was agreed on; both pare  
ties prefented, and fired in fucceffion: the intervening time  
is not expreffed, as the feconds did not precifely agree on that

This is the firat time that Aaron Burr, the alde  
of Montgomery, has been called a cow­  
ard. If the meeting of Burr and Hamilton,  
which resulted in the death of the latter, was  
not a duel, what was it? It is true that Alex­  
ander Hamilton, in a note written just before  
he went to the ground, and found after his  
death, expressed an intention to throw away his  
first fire. Burr was not, nowever, aware of this  
intention, but arranged all his affairs, and made  
his will, in the expectation of a probably fatal  
rencontre.  
The rules that were to govern the two in firing  
were as follows: &quot;The parties being placed at  
their stations, the second who gives the word  
shall ask them whether they are ready; being  
answered in the affirmative, he shall say. &quot;Pre­
