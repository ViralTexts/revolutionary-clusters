t if the jurisdiction of the national government in the article of revenue should be restricted to particular objects, it would naturally occasion an undue proportion of the public burthens to fall upon those objects. Two evils would spring from this source, the oppression of particular branches of industry, and an unequal distribution of the taxes, as well among the several States as among the citizens of the same State.  
Suppose, as has been contended for, the fœderal power of taxation were to be confined to duties on imports, it is evident that the government, for want of being able to command other resources, would frequently be tempted to extend these duties to an injurious excess. There are persons who imagine that this can never be carried to too great a length; since the higher they are, the more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an extravagant consumption, to produce a favourable balance of trade, and to promote domestic manufactures. But all extremes are pernicious in various ways. Exorbitant duties on imported articles would beget a general spirit of smuggling; which is always prejudicial to the fair trader, and eventually to the revenue itself: They tend to render other classes of the community tributary in an improper degree to the manufacturing classes to whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets: They sometimes force industry out of its more natural channels into others in which it flows with less advantage. And in the last place they oppress the merchant, who is often obliged to pay them himself without any retribution from the consumer. When the demand is equal to the quantity of goods at market, the consumer generally pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be overstocked, a great proportion falls upon the merchant, and sometimes not only exhausts his profits, but breaks in upon his capital. I am apt to think that a division of the duty between the seller and the buyer more often happens than is commonly imagined. It is not always possible to raise the price of a commodity, in exact proportion to every additional imposition laid upon it. The merchant especially, in a country of small commercial capital, is often under a necessity of keeping prices down, in order to a more expeditious sale.  
  
The maxim that the consumer is the payer, is so much oftener true than the reverse of the proposition, that it is far more equitable the duties on imports should go into a common stock, than that they should redound to the exclusive benefit of the importing States. But it is not so generally true as to render it equitable that those duties should form the only national fund. When they are paid by the merchant, they operate as an additional tax upon the importing State; whose citizens pay their proportion of them in the character of consumers. In this view they are productive of inequality among the States; which inequality would be encreased with the encreased extent of the duties. The confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts, would be attended with inequality, from a different cause between the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing States. The States which can go furthest towards the supply of their own wants, by their own manufactures, will not, according to their numbers of wealth, consume so great a proportion of imported articles, as those States which are not in the same favourable situation; they would not therefore in this mode alone contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their abilities. To make them do this, it is necessary that recourse be had to excises; the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures. New-York is more deeply interested in these considerations than such of her citizens as contend for limiting the power of the Union to external taxation can be aware of—New-York is an importing State, and is not likely speedily to be to any great extent a manufacturing State. She would of course suffer in a double light from restraining the jurisdiction of the Union to commercial imposts.  
So far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger of the import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may be observed, conformably to a remark made in another part of these papers, that the interest of the revenue itself would be a sufficient guard against such an extreme. I readily admit that this would be the case as long as other resources were open; but if the avenues to them were closed HOPE stimulated by necessity would beget experiments fortified by rigorous precautions and additional penalties; which for a time would have the intended effect, till there had been leisure to contrive expedients to elude these new precautions. The first success would be apt to inspire false opinions; which it might require a long course of subsequent experience to correct. Necessity, especially in politics, often occasions false hopes, false reasonings and a system of measures, correspondently erroneous.

 been made of a contrary supposition in reference to the immediate subject of our inquiries.  
The idea of an actual representation of all classes of the people by persons of each class is altogether visionary. Unless it were expressly provided in the Constitution that each different occupation should send one or more members the thing would never take place in practice. Mechanics and manufacturers will always be inclined with few exceptions to give their votes to merchants in preference to persons of their own professions or trades. Those discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic and manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile enterprise and industry. Many of them indeed are immediately connected with the operations of commerce. They know that the merchant is their natural patron and friend; and they are aware that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their own good sense, their interests can be more effectually promoted by the merchant than by themselves. They are sensible that their habits in life have not been such as to give them those acquired endowments, without which in a deliberative assembly the greatest natural abilities are for the most part useless; and that the influence and weight and superior acquirements of the merchants render them more equal to a contest with any spirit which might happen to infuse itself into the public councils unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading interests. These considerations and many others that might b

ngement that leaves the votes of the people free. Where this is the case, the representative body, with too few exceptions to have any influence on the spirit of the government, will be composed of land-holders, merchants, and men of the learned professions. But where is the danger that the interests and feelings of the different classes of citizens will not be understood or attended to by these three descriptions of men? Will not the land-holder know and feel whatever will promote or injure the interests of landed property? and will he not from his own interest in that species of property be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to prejudice or incumber it?

them himself, without any retribution from the consumer. When the  
demand is equal to the quantity of goods in market, the consumer gen-  
erally pays the duty; but when the market happens to be overstocked  
a great proportion falls upon the merchant, and sometimes not only ex-  
hausts his profits but breaks in upon his capital. [ am apt to think,  
that a division of the duty, between the selier and the buyer, more oft-  
en happen than is commonly imagined. {tis not always possible to  
raise the price of the commodity, in exact proportion to every addi-  
tional impositicn laid upon it. The merchant is often under the neces-  
sity of keeping prices down, in order to a more expeditious sale.  
  
“The maxim, that the consumer is the payer, is so much oftener  
true than the reverse of the proposition, that it is far more equitable  
that the duties on imports should go into a common stock, than that  
they should redound to the exclusive benefit of the importing States.  
But it is not so generally true as to render it equitable that those duties  
should form the only national fund. When they are paid by the merchant  
they operate as an additional tax upon the importing State, whose citi-  
zens pay their proportion of them im the character of consumers. In  
this view they are productive of inequality among the States ; which in-  
equality would be increased with the increased extent of the duties.  
The confinement of the national revenues to this species of imposts,  
would be attended with inequality, from a different cause, between the  
manufacturing and the non-manufacturing States. ‘The States which  
can go farthest towards the supply of their own wants, by their own  
manufactures, will not, according to their numbers, or wealth, consume  
so great a proportion of unported articles as those States which are not  
inthe same favourable situation; they would not therefore, in this  
mode alone, contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their abili-  
ties. ‘To make them do this, it is necessary that recourse be had to ex-  
the proper objects of which are particular kinds of manufactures.  
An importing and non-manufacturing State would, of course, sutler in  
a double light, from restraining the jurisdiction of the Union to com-  
mercial imposts.” £&#x27;ederalist, No. 35.

Hamilton, in one of the numbers of the Federalist,  
was this: &quot;So far as these observations tend to incul- ,n  
cete a danger of the import duties being extended to an  
injurious extreme, it may be observed, conformably to a to  
remark made in another part of those papers, that the 8t

against any such extreme&quot;?in &quot;other words, that the en  
power of taxing imports being alone given for pur- no

&quot;Suppose the federal power of taxation wire to be
