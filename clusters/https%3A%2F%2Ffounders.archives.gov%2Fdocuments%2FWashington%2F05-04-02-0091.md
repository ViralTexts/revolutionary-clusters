By the President of the United States of America. a Proclamation.  
Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor—and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me “to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.”  
Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will  
  
be—That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks—for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country previous to their becoming a Nation—for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his Providence which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war—for the great degree of tranquillity, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed—for the peaceable and rational manner, in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted—for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed; and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.  
and also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions—to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually—to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed—to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord—To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease of science among them and us—and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.

of the earliest acts of the two Houses was, by a joint  
resolution, to request the President “to recommend  
to the people of the United States a day of Public  
Thanksgiving and Prayer, to be observed by ac-  
knowledging with grateful hearts the many and  
signal favors of Almighty God, especially in afford-  
ing them an opportunity of peaceably establishing a  
form of government for their safety and happiness.”  
This congenial duty was well performed by Wasu-  
INGTON, who, in a proclamation worthy of the occa-  
sion, “recommended and assigned Thursday, the  
twenty-ninth of November’ (1789), ‘to be devoted  
by the people of these States to the service of the  
great and glorious Being who Its the beneficent au-  
thor of all the good that was, that is, that will be.”  
The subjects of thankfulness are set forth in suc-  
cinct but comprehensive terms—the “ kind care and  
protection of Providence, which the people of this  
country had experienced previous to its becoming a  
nation ;” the happy conclusion of the recent war;  
the tranquillity, union, and plenty which had since  
been enjoyed; the peaceable and rational manner  
in which the people had been enabled to establish  
constitutions of government for their safety and  
happiness; the clvil and religious liberty with which  
they were blessed ; and the means they possessed of  
acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge.

Wherees, It is the duty of all nations to

God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His

Congress have, by their joint committee, re  
nested me to recommend to the people of  
the United States a day of public thanksgiv­

with grateful hearts the many and sig

aflording them an opportunity of peaceably

ixth of November next, to be devoted by  
the people of these states to the service of  
the great and glorious Being who is the be
