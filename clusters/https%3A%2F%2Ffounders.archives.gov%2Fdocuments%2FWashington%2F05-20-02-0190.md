From the Office of State, you will receive every thing that relates to public concerns; and the Gazettes (which I presume will accompany the dispatches) will give you a pretty good idea of the state of Politics, and Parties in this country; and will shew you, at the sametime (if Bache’s Aurora is among them) in what manner I am attacked for persevering, steadily, in measures which, to me, appear necessary to preserve us (during the conflicts of the Belligerent powers) in a state of tranquillity. But these attacks, unjust, and as unpleasant as they are, will occasion no change in my conduct; nor will they produce any other effect in my mind than to increase the solicitude which, long since, has taken fast hold of my breast, to enjoy, in the shades of retirement, the consolation of believing that I have rendered my country every service to which my abilities were competent—not from pecuniary or ambitious motives, nor from a desire to provide for any one farther than their intrinsic merit entitled them to; and surely not with a view to bring any of my own relations into Office.  
  
Malignity, therefore, may dart its shafts, but no earthly power can deprive me of the consolation of knowing that I have not, in the whole course of my Administration (however numerous they may have been) committed an intentional error.
