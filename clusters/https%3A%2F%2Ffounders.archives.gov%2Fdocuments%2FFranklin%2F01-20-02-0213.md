For the Public Advertiser.  
Rules by which a GREAT Empire may be reduced to a SMALL ONE. [Presented privately to a late Minister, when he entered upon his Administration; and now first published.]  
An ancient Sage valued himself upon this, that tho’ he could not fiddle, he knew how to make a great City of a little one. The Science that I, a modern Simpleton, am about to communicate is the very reverse.  
I address myself to all Ministers who have the Management of extensive Dominions, which from their very Greatness are become troublesome to govern, because the Multiplicity of their Affairs leaves no Time for fiddling.  
I. In the first Place, Gentlemen, you are to consider, that a great Empire, like a great Cake, is most easily diminished at the Edges. Turn your Attention therefore first to your remotest Provinces; that as you get rid of them, the next may follow in Order.  
II. That the Possibility of this Separation may always exist, take special Care the Provinces are never incorporated with the Mother Country, that they do not enjoy the same common Rights, the same Privileges in Commerce, and that they are governed by severer Laws, all of your enacting, without allowing them any Share in the Choice of the Legislators. By carefully making and preserving such Distinctions, you will (to keep to my Simile of the Cake) act like a wise Gingerbread Baker, who, to facilitate a Division, cuts his Dough half through in those Places, where, when bak’d, he would have it broken to Pieces.  
  
III. These remote Provinces have perhaps been acquired, purchas’d, or conquer’d, at the sole Expence of the Settlers or their Ancestors, without the Aid of the Mother Country. If this should happen to increase her Strength by their growing Numbers ready to join in her Wars, her Commerce by their growing Demand for her Manufactures, or her Naval Power by greater Employment for her Ships and Seamen, they may probably suppose some Merit in this, and that it entitles them to some Favour; you are therefore to forget it all, or resent it as if they had done you Injury. If they happen to be zealous Whigs, Friends of Liberty, nurtur’d in Revolution Principles, remember all that to their Prejudice, and contrive to punish it: For such Principles, after a Revolution is thoroughly established, are of no more Use, they are even odious and abominable.  
IV. However peaceably your Colonies have submitted to your Government, shewn their Affection to your Interest, and patiently borne their Grievances, you are to suppose them always inclined to revolt, and treat them accordingly. Quarter Troops among them, who by their Insolence may provoke the rising of Mobs, and by their Bullets and Bayonets suppress them. By this Means, like the Husband who uses his Wife ill from Suspicion, you may in Time convert your Suspicions into Realities.  
V. Remote Provinces must have Governors, and Judges, to represent the Royal Person, and execute every where the delegated Parts of his Office and Authority. You Ministers know, that much of the Strength of Government depends on the Opinion of the People; and much of that Opinion on the Choice of Rulers placed immediately over them. If you send them wise and good Men for Governors, who study the Interest of the Colonists, and advance their Prosperity, they will think their King wise and good, and that he wishes the Welfare of his Subjects. If you send them learned and upright Men for judges, they will think him a Lover of Justice. This may attach your Provinces more to his Government. You are therefore to be careful who you recommend for those Offices. If you can find Prodigals who have ruined their Fortunes, broken Gamesters or Stock-Jobbers, these may do well as Governors; for they will probably be rapacious, and provoke the People by their Extortions. Wrangling Proctors and petty-fogging Lawyers too are not amiss, for they will be for ever disputing and quarrelling with their little Parliaments, if withal they should be ignorant, wrong-headed and insolent, so much the better. Attorneys Clerks and Newgate Solicitors will do for Chief-Justices, especially if they hold their Places during your Pleasure: And all will contribute to impress those ideas of your Government that are proper for a People you would wish to renounce it.  
VI. To confirm these Impressions, and strike them deeper, whenever the Injured come to the Capital with Complaints of Mal-administration, Oppression, or Injustice, punish such Suitors with long Delay, enormous Expence, and a final Judgment in Favour of the Oppressor. This will have an admirable Effect every Way. The Trouble of future Complaints will be prevented, and Governors and Judges will be encouraged to farther Acts of Oppression and Injustice; and thence the People may become more disaffected, and at length desperate.  
VII. When such Governors have crammed their Coffers, and made themselves so odious to the People that they can no longer remain among them with Safety to their Persons, recall and reward them with Pensions. You may make them Baronets too, if that respectable Order should not think fit to resent it. All will contribute to encourage new Governors in the same Practices, and make the supreme Government detestable.  
VIII. If when you are engaged in War, your Colonies should vie in liberal Aids of Men and Money against the common Enemy, upon your simple Requisition, and give far beyond their Abilities, reflect, that a Penny taken from them by your Power is more honourable to you than a Pound presented by their Benevolence. Despise therefore their voluntary Grants, and resolve to harrass them with novel Taxes. They will probably complain to your Parliaments that they are taxed by a Body in which they have no Representative, and that this is contrary to common Right. They will petition for Redress. Let the Parliaments flout their Claims, reject their Petitions, refuse even to suffer the reading of them, and treat the Petitioners with the utmost Contempt. Nothing can have a better Effect, in producing the Alienation proposed; for though many can forgive Injuries, none ever forgave Contempt.  
IX. In laying these Taxes, never regard the heavy Burthens those remote People already undergo, in defending their own Frontiers, supporting their own provincial Governments, making new Roads, building Bridges, Churches and other public Edifices, which in old Countries have been done to your Hands by your Ancestors, but which occasion constant Calls and Demands on the Purses of a new People. Forget the Restraints you lay on their Trade for your own Benefit, and the Advantage a Monopoly of this Trade gives your exacting Merchants. Think nothing of the Wealth those Merchants and your Manufacturers acquire by the Colony Commerce; their encreased Ability thereby to pay Taxes at home; their accumulating, in the Price of their Commodities, most of those Taxes, and so levying them from their consuming Customers: All this, and the Employment and Support of thousands of your Poor by the Colonists, you are intirely to forget. But remember to make your arbitrary Tax more grievous to your Provinces, by public Declarations importing that your Power of taxing them has no limits, so that when you take from them without their Consent a Shilling in the Pound, you have a clear Right to the other nineteen. This will probably weaken every Idea of Security in their Property, and convince them that under such a Government they have nothing they can call their own; which can scarce fail of producing the happiest Consequences!  
X. Possibly indeed some of them might still comfort themselves, and say, “Though we have no Property, we have yet something left that is valuable; we have constitutional Liberty both of Person and of Conscience. This King, these Lords, and these Commons, who it seems are too remote from us to know us and feel for us, cannot take from us our Habeas Corpus Right, or our Right of Trial by a Jury of our Neighbours: They cannot deprive us of the Exercise of our Religion, alter our ecclesiastical Constitutions, and compel us to be Papists if they please, or Mahometans.” To annihilate this Comfort, begin by Laws to perplex their Commerce with infinite Regulations impossible to be remembered and observed; ordain Seizures of their Property for every Failure; take away the Trial of such Property by Jury, and give it to arbitrary Judges of your own appointing, and of the lowest Characters in the Country, whose Salaries and Emoluments are to arise out of the Duties or Condemnations, and whose Appointments are during Pleasure. Then let there be a formal Declaration of both Houses, that Opposition to your Edicts is Treason, and that Persons suspected of Treason in the Provinces may, according to some obsolete Law, be seized and sent to the Metropolis of the Empire for Trial; and pass an Act that those there charged with certain other Offences shall be sent away in Chains from their Friends and Country to be tried in the same Manner for Felony. Then erect a new Court of Inquisition among them, accompanied by an armed Force, with Instructions to transport all such suspected Persons, to be ruined by the Expence if they bring over Evidences to prove their Innocence, or be found guilty and hanged if they can’t afford it. And lest the People should think you cannot possibly go any farther, pass another solemn declaratory Act, that “King, Lords, and Commons had, hath, and of Right ought to have, full Power and Authority to make Statutes of sufficient Force and Validity to bind the unrepresented Provinces IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER.” This will include Spiritual with temporal; and taken together, must operate wonderfully to your Purpose, by convincing them, that they are at present under a Power something like that spoken of in the Scriptures, which can not only kill their Bodies, but damn their Souls to all Eternity, by compelling them, if it pleases, to worship the Devil.  
XI. To make your Taxes more odious, and more likely to procure Resistance, send from the Capital a Board of Officers to superintend the Collection, composed of the most indiscreet, ill-bred and insolent you can find. Let these have large Salaries out of the extorted Revenue, and live in open grating Luxury upon the Sweat and Blood of the Industrious, whom they are to worry continually with groundless and expensive Prosecutions before the above-mentioned arbitrary Revenue-Judges, all at the Cost of the Party prosecuted tho’ acquitted, because the King is to pay no Costs. Let these Men by your Order be exempted from all the common Taxes and Burthens of the Province, though they and their Property are protected by its Laws. If any Revenue Officers are suspected of the least Tenderness for the People, discard them. If others are justly complained of, protect and reward them. If any of the Under-officers behave so as to provoke the People to drub them, promote those to better Offices: This will encourage others to procure for themselves such profitable Drubbings, by multiplying and enlarging such Provocations, and all with work towards the End you aim at.  
XII. Another Way to make your Tax odious, is to misapply the Produce of it. If it was originally appropriated for the Defence of the Provinces and the better Support of Government, and the Administration of Justice where it may be necessary, then apply none of it to that Defence, but bestow it where it is not necessary, in augmented Salaries or Pensions to every Governor who has distinguished himself by his Enmity to the People, and by calumniating them to their Sovereign. This will make them pay it more unwillingly, and be more apt to quarrel with those that collect it, and those that imposed it, who will quarrel again with them, and all shall contribute to your main Purpose of making them weary of your Government.  
XIII. If the People of any Province have been accustomed to support their own Governors and Judges to Satisfaction, you are to apprehend that such Governors and Judges may be thereby influenced to treat the People kindly, and to do them Justice. This is another Reason for applying Part of that Revenue in larger Salaries to such Governors and Judges, given, as their Commissions are, during your Pleasure only, forbidding them to take any Salaries from their Provinces; that thus the People may no longer hope any Kindness from their Governors, or (in Crown Cases) any Justice from their Judges. And as the Money thus mis-applied in one Province is extorted from all, probably all will resent the Misapplication.  
XIV. If the Parliaments of your Provinces should dare to claim Rights or complain of your Administration, order them to be harass’d with repeated Dissolutions. If the same Men are continually return’d by new Elections, adjourn their Meetings to some Country Village where they cannot be accommodated, and there keep them during Pleasure; for this, you know, is your Prerogative; and an excellent one it is, as you may manage it, to promote Discontents among the People, diminish their Respect, and increase their Disaffection.  
XV. Convert the brave honest Officers of your Navy into pimping Tide-waiters and Colony Officers of the Customs. Let those who in Time of War fought gallantly in Defence of the Commerce of their Countrymen, in Peace be taught to prey upon it. Let them learn to be corrupted by great and real Smugglers; but (to shew their Diligence) scour with armed Boats every Bay, Harbour, River, Creek, Cove or Nook throughout the Coast of your Colonies, stop and detain every Coaster, every Wood-boat, every Fisherman, tumble their Cargoes, and even their Ballast, inside out and upside down; and if a Penn’orth of Pins is found un-entered, let the Whole be seized and confiscated. Thus shall the Trade of your Colonists suffer more from their Friends in Time of Peace, than it did from their Enemies in War. Then let these Boats Crews land upon every Farm in their Way, rob the Orchards, steal the Pigs and Poultry, and insult the Inhabitants. If the injured and exasperated Farmers, unable to procure other Justice, should attack the Agressors, drub them and burn their Boats, you are to call this High Treason and Rebellion, order Fleets and Armies into their Country, and threaten to carry all the Offenders three thousand Miles to be hang’d, drawn and quartered. O! this will work admirably!  
XVI. If you are told of Discontents in your Colonies, never believe that they are general, or that you have given Occasion for them; therefore do not think of applying any Remedy, or of changing any offensive Measure. Redress no Grievance, lest they should be encouraged to demand the Redress of some other Grievance. Grant no Request that is just and reasonable, lest they should make another that is unreasonable. Take all your Informations of the State of the Colonies from your Governors and Officers in Enmity with them. Encourage and reward these Leasing-makers; secrete their lying Accusations lest they should be confuted; but act upon them as the clearest Evidence, and believe nothing you hear from the Friends of the People. Suppose all their Complaints to be invented and promoted by a few factious Demagogues, whom if you could catch and hang, all would be quiet. Catch and hang a few of them accordingly; and the Blood of the Martyrs shall work Miracles in favour of your Purpose.  
XVII. If you see rival Nations rejoicing at the Prospect of your Disunion with your Provinces, and endeavouring to promote it: If they translate, publish and applaud all the Complaints of your discontented Colonists, at the same Time privately stimulating you to severer Measures; let not that alarm or offend you. Why should it? since you all mean the same Thing.  
XVIII. If any Colony should at their own Charge erect a Fortress to secure their Port against the Fleets of a foreign Enemy, get your Governor to betray that Fortress into your Hands. Never think of paying what it cost the Country, for that would look, at least, like some Regard for Justice; but turn it into a Citadel to awe the Inhabitants and curb their Commerce. If they should have lodged in such Fortress the very Arms they bought and used to aid you in your Conquests, seize them all, ’twill provoke like Ingratitude added to Robbery. One admirable Effect of these Operations will be, to discourage every other Colony from erecting such Defences, and so their and your Enemies may more easily invade them, to the great Disgrace of your Government, and of course the Furtherance of your Project.  
XIX. Send Armies into their Country under Pretence of protecting the Inhabitants; but instead of garrisoning the Forts on their Frontiers with those Troops, to prevent Incursions, demolish those Forts, and order the Troops into the Heart of the Country, that the Savages may be encouraged to attack the Frontiers, and that the Troops may be protected by the Inhabitants: This will seem to proceed from your Ill will or your Ignorance, and contribute farther to produce and strengthen an Opinion among them, that you are no longer fit to govern them.  
XX. Lastly, Invest the General of your Army in the Provinces with great and unconstitutional Powers, and free him from the Controul of even your own Civil Governors. Let him have Troops enow under his Command, with all the Fortresses in his Possession; and who knows but (like some provincial Generals in the Roman Empire, and encouraged by the universal Discontent you have produced) he may take it into his Head to set up for himself. If he should, and you have carefully practised these few excellent Rules of mine, take my Word for it, all the Provinces will immediately join him, and you will that Day (if you have not done it sooner) get rid of the Trouble of governing them, and all the Plagues attending their Commerce and Connection from thenceforth and for ever.

RULES dy which a GREAT EMPIRE  
may be reduced t0a SMALL ONE.  
  
AN ancient Sage boafted, that, tho” he  
  
could rot fiddle, he knew how to  
make&#x27;a great city of a little one. The  
{cience that I, a modern finipleton, am  
about to communicate, is the very re~  
verfe..  
  
I addrefs myfelf to all minifters who  
have the management of extenfive do-  
minions, which from their very great-  
nefs are become troublefome to govern,  
becanfe the multiplicity of their affairs  
leaves no time for fiddling.  
  
I. In the firft place, gentlemen, you  
are to confider, that a great empire, tike  
a greatcake, is mofteafily diminifhed  
at the edges. Turn your attention,  
therefore, firt to your remo ft piro-  
vinces; that, as you get rid of them,  
the next may follow in order.  
  
II. That the peffibiliry of this fes  
paration may always exift, take fpecial  
care the provinces are never incorporat  
de with themother country ; that they do  
not enjoy the fame common rights, the  
fame privileges in commerce 5 and that  
they are governed by /everer laws, all  
of your enaéting, without. allowing  
them any fhare in the choice of the  
legiflators. By carefully making and  
preferving fuch diftinétions, you will  
(to keep to my fimile of the cake) a&amp;  
like a wife gingerbread baker, who, to  
facilitate a divifion, cuts his dough half .  
through in thofe places, where, when  
baked, he would have it broken to pieces.  
  
IIE: Thefe remote provinces have  
perhaps been acquired, purchafed, or  
conquered, at the /ole expence of the  
fetilers or their anceftors, without the  
aid of the mother country. If this  
fhould happen to increafe her frrength  
by their growing nuinbers ready to join  
in her wars, her commerce by their  
growing demand for her manufaAtures,  
or her aval power by greater employ-  
ment for her fhips and feamen, they  
may probably fuppofe fome merit in  
this, and that it entitles them to fome  
favour; you are therefore to forget it  
all, or refent it-as if they had done  
If they happen to be  
zealous Whigs, friends of liberty, nur-  
tured’in revolution principles, remem  
ber all that to their prejudice, and  
refolve to punifh it; for fuch prin-  
ciples, after a revolution is thoroughly  
eftablifhed, are of no more uf, they  
are even odious and abominabie.  
  
IV, However peaceably your colo-  
  
‘nies have fubmulitted to your govern-  
  
ment, fhewn their affeRion to your in-  
terefts,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
442  
terefts, and patiently borne their grie-  
vances, you are to fuppofe them always  
inctined to revolt, and treat them ac-  
cordingly. Quarter troops amongthem,  
who by their infolence may prewoke  
the 1ifirg of mobs, and by their bul-  
Jets and bayonets /upprefs them. By  
this means, like the -hufband who ules  
his wife ill from fufpicion, your may in  
time convert your /ufpicions into. rea-  
hities. .  
  
V. Remote provinees muft have Go-  
wernors, and Judges, to reprefent the  
Royal Perfon, and execute every.  
where the_delegated parts of his office  
and zuthority. You minifters know,  
that much of the itieng:h of govern-  
ment depends on the opinion of the  
people; and muci ef that opinion on  
the choice of rulers placed immediately  
over th m. It youtend them wife and  
good m_n for governors, who ftucy the  
iniercft of the colenifts, and advance  
thew profoerity, they will think their  
Kinz «ife and good, and. thet he  
wifhes the welfare of his fubjects. If  
you fend them learned and upright men  
for Judges, they will think him a lover  
of juftice. This may attach your pro-  
vinces more to his government. ‘ou  
are, therefore, to be careful who you  
  
reccmmend for thofe offices.—If you  
can find prodigals who have ruined  
their fortunes, broken g:mefters or  
ftock-jobbers, thefe may do well as  
governors; for they will probably be  
rapacious, and provoke the people by  
  
their extortions. Wrangling proétors  
and pettifogging lawyers, too, are not  
amifs; for they will be for ever dif-  
puting -and quarrelling with their lit-  
tle parliaments. If withal they fhou!d  
be ignorant, wrong headed and in‘o-  
lent, fo much the better. Attornies  
clerks and Newgate folicitors will do  
for Chief-Fuflices, efpecially if they  
hold their places during your pleafure.  
And all will contribute to imprefs thofe  
ideas of your government that are pio-  
per for a people you would wih to re-  
mounce it.  
  
Vi. To confirm thefe impreffions,  
and ftrike them deeper, whenever the  
injured come to the et with com-  
plaints of mal-adminiftration, cppref-  
fion, or injuftice, punith fuch fuitors  
with Jong delay, enormcus expence,  
and a final judgment ih favour of the  
  
oppreffor. This will have an admira- ~  
  
bie effet every way. The trouble of fu-  
ture complaints will be prevented, and  
. Governors and Judges. will be en-  
couraged to farther #&amp;s of orpreffion  
and injuftice; and thence the people  
  
countries have been done to  
  
Rules for reducing a great Empire to a fmail one,  
  
may become more difaffected, and at  
length defperate.°  
  
VII. When fuch Governors have  
crammed their coffers, and made them-  
felves fo odious to the people that they  
can no longer remain among them  
in fafety to their pesfons,, recal and  
reward them with penfions. You  
may make them Bareaets, to, if that  
refpe&amp;table order feud not think fit  
to refent it. AlJl will contribute to  
encourage new governors in, the fime  
practiccs, and make the fupieme go-  
vernment defeffable.  
  
VIII. If, when you are engaged. in  
war, ycur colonies should vie im libeval  
aids of men and money, againit the  
common enemy, upon ycur imple re-  
quifition, and give far beyond their  
  
, abilities, refleét, that a penny taken  
  
from them by your power is more ho-  
novrabie to yow than a peund prefent-  
ed by their benevolence. De&#x27;pite there-  
fore their voluntary grants, and res  
solve to harrafs them with ro-el taxes.  
They will probably complain. to your  
parliaments, that they are taxed bya  
body in which they have no reprefen-  
tative, and that this is contrary to come  
mon right. . They will petition for re-  
drefs. Let the Parliaments flout their  
claims, reject their petit‘ons, refufe  
even to fuffer the reading of them, and  
treat the petitioners -with the utmoft  
contempt. Nothing can have a bet-  
ter cf. in producing the alienation  
propofed ; for though many can for-  
give injuries, none ever forgave con-  
  
tempt.  
1X. In laying thefe taxes, never res  
gard the heavy buithens thofe remote  
people already undergo, in defending  
their own frontiers, fupporting their  
own provincial governments, making  
new roads, huilaing bridges, churches,  
and other public edifices, which in old  
our  
hands by your anceftors, but which  
occafion conftant calls and demands on  
the purfes of a new peeple. Forget the  
refraints you lay on thei trade for your  
own benefit, and the advan&#x27;age a mone-  
poly of this trade g-ves your exacting  
merchants. Think nothing of the  
wealth thofe merchants and your ma-  
nufaéturers acquire by the colony com-  
merce; thei: encreafed ability thereby  
to pay taxes at home; their accumu-  
lating, iv the price of their commodi-  
ties, moft of. thofe taxes, and fo levy  
ing them from their confuming cufto-  
mers; all this, and the em,loyment  
and fuppoit of theufands of your poor  
&#x27; ; y  
  
  
  
Riles for reducing atgreat Empire to a fmall one.  
  
by the colonifts, you are intirely to for-  
get. But remembcr to make your ar-  
bitrary tax more grievous to your pro-  
vinces, by public declarations import-  
ing that your power of taxing them  
has xo limits; fo that when you take  
from them without their confent one  
fhilling in the pound, you have a clear  
right to the other nineteen, ‘This will  
probably weaken every idea of fecurity  
in their property and convince them,  
that, under fuch a government, they  
have nothing they can call their own ;  
which can fcarce fail of producing the  
happieft confequences !  
  
Oe SLA, indeed, fome of them  
might fiilcomfort themfelves, ard fay,  
* Though we have no property, we  
  
have yet fomething left that is valua-  
* ble; we have conftitution’l Jiberty  
* both of pe:fon and of confcience.  
  
This King, thefe Lo.ds, and thefe  
© Commons, who, it feems, are too re-  
* mote from us to know us, and fee! for  
“ us, cannot take from us our Habeas-  
* Corpus right, orou. rightof trial by a  
* Jury of our neighbours; thy cannot  
* deprive us of the exercife of our re-  
* ligion, alter our ecclefiaftical conftiiu-  
“tion, and compel us to be Papifs if  
* they pleafe, or Mahometans.” To  
annihilate this comfort, begin by laws  
to perplex their commerce with infinite  
regulations impoffible to be remember-  
ed and obferved ; ordain feizures of their  
property for every failure ; takeaway the  
‘trial of fuch property by Jury, and giveit  
to aibitrary Judges of your own appoinf-  
ing, and of the loweft char: &amp;ers in the  
country, whofe falaries and emo!uments  
are to arife out of the duties or con-  
demnations, and whefe appointments  
are during pleafure. Then 1.1 there  
be a formal declaration of both houfs,  
  
that oppofitian to your edi&amp;ts is treafox ;  
and that any perion fufpe&amp;ted of treafon  
in thé provinces may, according to fome  
obfolcte law, be feized and fent to the  
metropolis ofthe empire for Giil; ard  
pafs an ad tat thofe there charged  
with tertain other offences fhall be Rene  
“away in chains from their friends -and  
country to be tried-in the fame manner  
‘for felony. Then ere&amp; a new Court  
of Inguifition among them, accompa-  
nied by an armed force, with inftruc-  
tions to tranfpert all fach fulpedted  
perfons, to be ruined by the expence if  
they bring over evidences to prove  
their innocence, or be found guilty  
and hanged’ if they cannot afford it.  
And, lett the people thould think you  
_annot poflibly go. any farther, pafs  
another {yJemn declaratory aét, that  
  
443:  
‘ King, Lords, and Commens had,  
© hath, and of right ou; ht to have,  
* full power and authority to make  
* flatutes of fufficient force and vali-  
‘ dity to bind the unreprefented pro-  
“vine s IN ALL CASES WH:ATSO-  
“gver. This will include /pirituat  
with temporal; and, taken together,  
mu operate wondeifully to your pur-  
pofe, by convincing them, that they  
are at piefent under a power fome-  
thiag like that fpoken of in the frip-  
tures, which cannot only &amp;if/ their toe  
dies, but dama their fouls to all eter.  
  
nity, by compelling them, if it pleafes,  
  
to worjbip the Devil.  
  
XI. To make your taxes more  
odious, and more likely to procure re-  
fiftance, ferd from‘the capital a board  
of officers to fuperintend the co!ic tion,  
compofed of the mof indifcreet, ill-  
bred, and infolent, you can find. Let  
thefe have large falaries out of the ex-  
torted revenue, and live in open grating  
luxury upon the fweat and biood of the  
induftrivus, whom they are to worry  
continually with groundlefs and expen-  
five profecutions before the above-men-  
tioned arbitrary revenue Judges, alt  
at the cof of the party profecuted, tho*  
acquitted, becaufe the King is to pay no  
cofts.—Let thefe men, by your order, be ~  
exempted fiom all the common taxes  
and bu:thens of the province, though  
they and their property are protected  
by its laws, If any :evenue officers  
‘are fufpefed of whe lerft tendernefs for  
the people, diftard them. If others  
are juitly.complained of, prote&amp; and  
reward them. If any of the under of-  
ficers behave fo as to provoke the peo.  
ple to drub them, promo e thofe to bet-  
ter offices? this will encourage others  
to procure for themfélves fuch profi-  
table drubbings, by multiplying and  
enlarging fuch provocations, and ail  
will werk towards the end you aim at,  
  
XII. Another way to make your  
tax odious, is to mifapply the produce  
of it, If it was ey appro-  
priated for the defence of the provinces,  
the better fupport of government,  
and the adminiitiation of juftice where  
jt may be necefary, then apply none of  
  
“Gt to tha: defence, but beltow it where  
  
it is not necefary, in augmented fala~  
ries or penfions to every governor who  
has diftinguihed himfelf by his enmity  
  
to the people, and by calumniating  
  
them to their fovereign. This will  
make them pay it more unwillingly,  
and be more apt to quarrel with thofe  
  
that collet it,* and tliof that impofcd  
  
it,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
444  
it, who will quarrel again with them,  
and all fhall conwibute to your main  
purpofe of making them weary of your  
government.  
  
XIII. If the people of any province  
have becn accuftomed to fupport their  
own Governors and Judges to fatisfac-  
tion, you are to apprehend that fuch  
Governors and Judges may be thereby  
influenced to treat the people kindly,  
and to do them juftice. This is ano-  
ther reafon for applying part of that  
revenue in larger falasies to fuch Go-  
vernors and Judges, given, as their  
commiffions are, during your pleafure  
  
only, forbidding them to take any fa- -  
  
laries from their provinces; that thus  
the people may no longer hope any  
kindnefs from theic Governors, or (in  
Crown cafes) any juftice from their  
Judges. And as the money thus mif-  
appiied in one province is extorted from  
all, probably all will refent the mif-  
application.  
  
X1V. If the parliaments of your  
provinces fhould dare to claim rights,  
or complain of your adminiftration,  
order them to be harraffed with repeated  
diffolutions. If the fame men are con-  
tinually returned by new ele&amp;tions, ad-  
jovrn their meetings to fome country  
village where they cannot be. accom-  
modated, and there keep them during  
pleafure; for this, you know, is your  
PREROGATIVE; and an excellent one  
it is, as you may manage it, to pro-  
mote dilcontents among the people,  
diminifh their refpeé&amp;t, and increafe  
their difaffedction.  
  
XV. Convert the brave honeft of-  
ficers of your navy into pimping tide-  
waiters and colony officers of the cuf-  
toms. Let thofe who, in time of war,  
fonght gallantly in. defence of the  
  
commerce of their countrymen, in.  
  
peace be taught to prey upon it. Let  
them learn to be cotrupted by great  
and. real. fmugglers; but (to thew  
their diligence) fcour with arméd boats  
every bay, harbour, river, creek, cove,  
or nook, throughout the coaft of your  
colonies; ftop and detain every coafter,  
every wood boat, every fifherman, tum-  
ble their cargoes, and even their ballaft,  
infide out, and uplide down ; and, if a  
penn’orth of pins is found un-entcred,  
Jet the whole be feized and coniifcated.  
Thus fliali the trade of your colonifts  
fuffer more from their friends in time  
of peace, than it did from their. ene-  
mics in war. Then let thefe boats  
crews land upon every farm in their  
way, rob the orchards, feal the pigs  
  
Rules for reducing a great Eqpire to a fmall one.  
  
and the poultry, and infult the. in-  
habitants.’ If the «injured and exaf-  
perated farmer, unable to procure  
other juice, fhould attack the agref-. .  
fors, drub them and burn their boats ;  
you are to call this high treafon and  
rebellion, order fleets and armies into  
their couniry, and threaten to carry  
all the offenders three thoufand miles  
to be hanged, drawn, and quartered,  
O! this will work admirably !  
  
XVI. If you are told of difcon-  
tents in your colonies, never believe  
that they ate general, or that yéu have  
given occafion for them ; therefore, do  
not think of applying any remedy, o¢  
of changing any offenhve meafure.  
Redrefs no grievance, left they fhould  
be encouraged to demand the redrefs  
of fome other grievance. Grant no  
requeft that is juft and reafonable,  
Jeft they fhould make another that is  
unreafonable. Take all your infor;  
mations of the ftate of the colonies  
from your Governors and officers ip  
enmity with them. Encourage and  
reward thele leafing- makers; fecrete  
their lying accufations, left they thould  
be confuted; but aé&amp;t upon them as  
the clearcft evid.nce, and believe no-  
thing you hear from the friends of the  
people: fuppofe all their complaints  
to be invented and promoted by a few  
fa&amp;tious dimagogues, whom if you  
could catch and hang, all would he  
quiet. Catch and hang a few of them  
accordingly ; and the blood of ihe  
Martyrs frail work miracles in favour  
of your purpofe.  
  
XVIT. If you fee rival nations re-  
joicing at the profpe&amp; of your difunion  
with your provinces, and endeavouring  
to promote it; if they tranflate, pub-  
lifh and applaud all the complaints of  
  
‘your difcontented coloniits, at the fame  
  
time privately ftin-ulating you to fe-  
verer meatures; let not that alarm or  
offend you, Why fhould it? fince  
you all mean the fame thing.  
  
XVIIT. If any colony fhould, at  
their own charge, ere&amp;t a forjrefs to  
fecure their port again&amp; the fleets of  
a foreign enemy, get your Governor to  
betray that fortrefs isto your hands.  
Never think of paying what it coft the  
country, for that would /ook, at lealt,  
like fome regard for juftice; but turn  
it inte a citadel to awe the inhabitants,  
and curb their commerce. If they  
fhould have lodged An fuch fortrefs the  
very arms they bought and ufed to aid  
yau in your coaquefts, feize them all;.  
it will ‘provoke like ingratitude added:

XX. Laftly, inveft the General of  
your army in the provinces with great  
and unconft.tutional powers, and free  
him from the controul of even your  
own Civil Governors. Let him have  
  
troops enow under his command, with  
  
all the fortrefles in his poffeflion ; and  
who knows but (like fome provincial  
Generals in the Roman empire, and

Vol. lII.]  
  
From tbe (London) Public Advertiter.  
RULES bn which a great Empire may be  
reduced to a small Owe. .  
[Presented privately to a late mini flir, when  
he entered upon hit administration ) and  
now fir ft publilhed.]  
AN ancient sage valued himfelf upon  
tbis,that though he could not fiddle,  
he knew how to make a great city of a little  
The fcicnce that 1, a modern simple­  
ton, am about to communicate is the very  
reverse. i  
I addrefa myfelf to all miniftera who  
have the management of extenfiv* domi­  
nions, which from their very greatnefa are  
become troublesome to govern, becaufc the  
multiplicity of their affairs leaves do time  
for fiddling.  
1. In the firft place. Gentlemen, you arc  
to eonfider, that a great empire, like a  
great cake, is most cafily diminished at the  
edges. Turn your attention therefore firft  
to your remotest provinces ; that as you  
get rid of them, the next may follow in  
order.  
IL That the pdffibility of thia reparation  
may always exift,foke fpecia) care the pro­  
vinces are never incorporated with the  
mother country, that they do not enjoy  
the fame common rights, the fame privi­  
leges in commerce, and that they are go­  
verned by severer laws, all of your enaßing,  
W&#x27;thout a&#x27;lwMH flwe in the  
enmee of the Jegiflatora. By carefully  
makhg and preserving such diftioAiona,  
you will (to keep to my fimiftof the cake J  
aa like a wife gingerbread baker, who,  
to facilitate a division, cuts his dough half  
through in those places, where, when  
baked, he would have it broken to pieces.  
HI. These remote provinces have per­  
haps been acquired, purcbafed, or conquer­  
ed at thefoie expence of the settlers or their  
ancestors, without the aid of the mother  
country. If this should happen to increase  
her flrength by their growing numbers ready  
to join in her wars, her commerce by their  
growing demand for her manufadures, or  
her naval power by greater employment for  
her ships and teamen, they may probably  
suppose (ome merit in this, and that it en­  
titles them to some favour ; you are there­  
fore to forget it ally or refeut it as if they  
had done you injury. If they happen to be  
zealous whigs, friends of liberty, nurtured  
in revolution principles, remember all that to  
their prejudice, and contrive to punish it:  
For such principles, after a revo&#x27;ution is  
thoroughly established, are of no more use,  
they aie even odious and abominable,  
IV. However peaceably your colonies  
have submitted to your government, (hewn  
their affedion to your inte -Rs, and pati­  
ently borne their grievances, you are to  
suppose them atWays inclined to revolt, and  
treat them accordingly. Quarter troops  
among them, who by their infolance may  
provoke the rising cf mobs, and by tbmr  
bullets and bayonets fiepprefi them. By  
this means, like the husband who utes his  
wife ill from (ufpiciou, you may in rime  
convert your fofpiciont into realitiec.  
V. Remote provinces must have Gover­  
nors, and fudges, to represent the Royal  
perlon, and execute every where the dele­  
gated parts of his office and authority. You  
ministers know, that much of the ftrengtb  
of government depends on the opinion of the  
people ; and much of that opinion on the  
choice of rulers placed immediately over  
them. If y«u fend them wife and good  
men for Governors, who study the interest  
ofthe colonifts,and advance their prosperity,  
they will think their King wife and good,  
and that be wishes the welfare of his fub­  
jefts. If you fend them learned and up­  
right men forjudges, they will think him a  
lover of justice. Thia may attach your  
provinces more to his government. ou  
ere therefore to be careful who you recom-  
  
Or, Thomas’s Bolton Journal.  
  
THURSDAY, jDecember i 6, 1773.  
  
mend for those offices.—lf yon can find  
prodigals who have ruined their fortunes,  
broken gamesters or ftoek jobbers, these  
may do well as Governors; for they will  
probably be rapacious, and provoke the  
people by their extortions. Wrangling  
Prohors and petty-fogging lawyers too are  
not amiss, for they will be for ever difpute­  
inglaod quarrelling with their little parlia­  
ments. If withal they should be ignorant,  
wrong-headed and insolent, so much the  
better. Attorneys Clerks and Newgate  
Solicitors will do for Chief Juflicet, especial­  
ly if they hold their places during your plea­  
sure And all will contribute to impress  
those ideas of your government that are  
proper for a people you would wijb to re­  
nounce it,  
VI, To confirm these impressions, and  
ftrlke them deeper, whenever the injured  
come to the capital with complaints of mal­  
administration, appro flion, or injustice, pu­  
nish such suitors with long delay, enor­  
mous expence and a final judgment in fa­  
vour of the oppressor. a hia will have an  
admirable eftrd every way. The trouble  
of future complaints will be prevented,  
and Governors and judges will be encour­  
aged to farther ads of oppreflion and in­  
juflice j and thence the people may be­  
come more difaffeded, and at length des­  
perate.  
VI I. When fuchGovernon have cram­  
med their coffers, and made themfclves so  
odious to the people that they can no lon-  
St remain among them with fafety to  
sir persona, recall and reward them  
with pensions. You may make them Ba­  
ronets too, if that rcfpednble order should  
not think fit to relent it. All will contri­  
bute to encourage new Governors in the  
fame pradiccs, and make the supreme go­  
vernment deteftabie.  
VilL If when you are engaged in war,  
your colonies should vie in liberal aids of  
men and money against the common ene­  
my, upon your Ample requisition, and give  
far beyond their abilities, refled, that a pen  
ny taken from them by your power is more  
honourable to you than a pound presented by  
their benevolence. Despise therefore their  
voluntary grants, and resolve to barrels  
them with noval taxes. They will proba­  
bly complain to your parliaments that they  
are taxed by a body in which they have no  
reprafentative, and that this is contrary to  
common right They will petition for redress  
Let the parliaments flout their claims, re­  
jed their petitions, xefufe even to fuffer the  
reading of them, and treat the petitioners  
with the utmost contempt. Nothing can  
have a better effed in producing the aliena­  
tion proposed ; for though many can for­  
give injuries, none ever fergavc+outempt.  
IX. in laying theft foxes, never regard  
the heavy burthens these remote people al­  
ready undergo, in defending their own  
frontiers, fapportihg their own provincial  
governments, making new roads, building  
ridges, churches and other public edifices,  
which in old countries have been done to  
your hands by your ancestors, but which  
occasion constant calls and demands on  
the purses of a new people. Forget the  
roflraints you lay on their trade for your own  
benefit, and the advantage a monopoly of this  
trade gives your exadwg merchants.  
Think nothing of the wealth those mer­  
chants and your manufadurers acquire by  
the colony commerce i their uncreated a­  
bility thereby to pay taxes at home j their  
accumulating, in the price of their commo­  
dities, most of those taxes, and so levying  
them from their consuming cuftomws :  
All this, and the employment and support  
of tboufandr of your poor by the colon fts,  
you arc entirely to forget- But remember  
to make your a:binary tax more grievous  
to your provinces, by ■ public declarations  
impoiting that your power of taxing them  
  
has no limits so that when you take from  
without their content a (hilling in  
ths* pound, you have a clear right to the  
other nineteen. This will probably weak­  
en evei r idea of security in their proper tv t  
and cons in«e them that under such a go­  
vernment nothing they can call  
their own j \which can scarce fail of pro­  
ducing the tonfequencee I  
X. Possibly \ ‘deed some of them might  
still comfort them Wves, and fay, ‘ though  
• we have no propv »‘y, wc have yet fome­  
‘ thing left shat is valuable; we have con -  
• ftiturional liberty both of person and of con­  
* fcicnce. This King, these Lords, and  
• these Commons, who it &lt;eems are 100 rc­  
* mote from us to know us sod feel for us,  
* cannot take from us ourHabuttCorput right,  
*or our of a jury of neighbour t\
• They cannot deprive us of the exeicife of  
• our religion, alter our ecelefiaftit*’ confti­  
-4 tution*, and compel us to be if they  
• plesfe, or Mahometants.’ To annihilate  
this comfort, begin bylaws to perplex their  
commerce with infinite regulations impoffiv e  
to be remembered and dbferved ; ordait?  
feiiurei of their property for every failure j  
take away the trial of such property by jury  
and give it to arbitrary judges of your own  
appointing,and of the lowest charaders in the  
country, whose salaries and emoluments aie  
to srife out of the duties or condemnations,  
and whose appoimmetus arc during pleafnre.  
Then let there be a formal declaration of  
both houses, that oppofuion to your edids is  
troafony and that peifons fufpeded of treason  
in the provinces may, according to some  
obfolute law, be seized and font to the me­  
tropolis of the Empire for trial; and pals an  
ad that those there charged with Certain o­  
thbr offences (ball be sent aw«y in chains  
from their friend* and country to be tried in  
the fame manner for felony. Then erect a  
new court of inquifitiojn among them, ac­  
companied by an armed force, with instruc­  
tions to transport all such fufpeded persons;  
to be ruined by ihe expence if they bring fl­  
ver evidences to prove their innocence, or  
be found guilty and hanged if they can t af­  
ford it. And left the people should think you  
cannot possibly go any farther, pass another  
fdemn declaratory Ad, that * King, Lords,  
• and Commons had, hath, and of Right  
• ought to have,full Power and Authority to  
• make Statutes of fuffleient Force and V»-  
4 lidity to bind the unprefented Provinces in  
4 all Cases whatsoever.’ This will  
include Spiritual with temporal; and taken  
together, must operate wonderfully to your  
purpose, by convincing them, ‘ that they are  
at profent under a power fomethibg like (hat  
spoken of in the Scriptures, l|ich cannot  
only ••IB their dadVtheir fouls  
*4 to alMternityrWby compelling them, if  
it pleases, to to worjbip the devil.  
JXL To make your taxes more odious,and  
more likely to procure resistance, fenu from  
।capital a board of officers to superintend  
the colledion, competed of the most indif­  
ertety ill-bred and insolent you can find. Let  
tbefe have large salaries out of the extorted  
revenue, and live in open grating luxury  
upon the sweat and blood of the industrious  
whom they are to worry continually with  
gnwndlcfs and expenfiveprofecutions before  
the above-mentioned arbitrary revenue­  
ludges, all «r the cofl of the party profecutod  
though acquitted, becaufc tnt king it to pay  
M cofft- Let these men by your order be ex­  
empted from all the common taxes and bur.  
thens of the province, though they and  
their property are protected by its laws. If  
any revenue officers are jufpelted of the least  
tenderness for the people, difeard them. If  
others are justly complained of, protect and  
reward them. 11 any of the under-officer*  
behave so a* to provoke the people to  
drub them, promote those to q^fice*;  
  
[Numb. 150.  
  
fi This will encourage others to procure for  
I themfclvrs such pofitable, drubbings, bv  
I multiplyinufand enlarging such provocations  
and all will work iowardt the end you aim&#x27;at.  
XH. Another way to make your tax o­  
dious, is to misapply the produce of it. If  
it was originally appropriated for the defence  
of the provinces and tbe better support of  
government, and the administration of jus­  
tice where it may be neccffary, then apply  
none of it to that defence, but bestow ft  
where it is not nectffary, in augmented fala«  
ries or pensions to every governor who hat  
distinguished himfelf by his enmity to the  
people, and by calumniating them to their  
lovereign. This will make them pay it  
more unwillingly, and be more apt to quar­  
rel with those that colled it, and those that  
imposed it, who will quarrel again with  
them, and all shall contribute to your main  
purpose of making them weary of your go»  
vernment, ... „ .  
XIII. If the people of any province have  
been accustomed to support their own go­  
vernors and judges to fatisfa&amp;ion, you are  
to apprehend that such governors and judg­  
es may be thereby influenced to treat the  
people kindly, and todothem justice. This ia  
pother reason for applying part of that re­  
venue in larger falariea to such governors  
and judges, given, as their commiflxons are  
during your pleasure only, forbidding them  
to take any salaries from their provinces %  
that thus tbe people may no longer hope any  
kindness from their governors, (or in crown  
cases) any justice from their judges. And ad  
the money thus mif-lpplitd in one province  
is extorted from all, probably all will ref mt  
tbe mis-application.  
XIV. If tbePamament* of your province  
should dare to claim rights or complain of  
your adminiftrat»on,order them to be harrafcd  
with repealed diffoldtiom. If the feme men  
are Continually returned by new deaions,  
adjourn ibeir meetings to some country vil­  
lage where they cannot be accomodated,and  
ihSre keep them during pleasure j for thia,  
you know, is your &gt;RERO&lt;JATItI ( and ail  
excellent one it is, as you may mwwe it, to  
promote difeontents among the people, di­  
minish their tefpea, and tntreaft tbetr dif­  
affeQioU. *  
XV. Concert the brave honest officers of  
your navy into pimping tide-waiters and  
colony officers of the Customs. Let those  
who in time of war fought gallantly in de­  
fence ofthe commerce of their countrymen,

be encouraged to demand the rcurt&lt;s of feme  
other grievance. Grant no request that is  
just and ceafontblc, left they fhuuid make a­  
nother that is unreafunable. Take ah year  
informations of the ftateof the colonics from  
your Governors and efficers in enmity with  
them. Encourage and reward these leafing  
makers; sec et their lying accusations left they  
fhnuld be confuted ; but act upon them as  
me eleareft evidence, and believe nothing  
you hear from the friends of the people.  
Suppof- all their complaints to be invented  
and promoted by a few factious demagogues,  
whom if you could catch and hang ail wouk  
be quiet. Catch and hang a few of them  
accordingly ; and the t/ood ts the martyrs fha I  
work miracles in favour of your purpose.  
XVII. If you fee rival nations rejoicing at  
the profpeit of your diiunion with your pro­  
vinces, and endeavouring to promote it: If  
they translate, publish and applaud all the  
complaints of your difeontenud cotanilh, al  
the fame time privately ftimu&#x27;a ing you to  
severer measures; let not that alarm or offend  
you. Why (hould it I iincc you all mean  
the fame thing.  
XVIII. If any colony (hou’d at their own  
charge errd a fortrefsto (ecure their port a  
gainft the fleets of a- foreign enemy, ge:  
your Governor to betray that forrtefs into  
your hands. Never think of paying what it  
cost the country, for that would look, at least,  
like fame regard for justice ; but turn it into  
a citadel to awe the inhabitants and curb  
their commerce. If they (hould have lodged  
in such fortrefs tho very arms they bought  
and used to aid you in your conquests, feizv  
them all,it will provoke Wh ingratitude added  
to robbety. One admirable effect of theft  
operations will be, todrfcourage every other  
colony from erecting such defences, and so  
their and your enemies may more easily in­  
vade them, to the great disgrace of your  
government, and of course the furtherance  
of your projefl.  
XIX. Send armies into their country un  
der pretence of proteding the inhabitants ;  
but mftead of garrisoning the forts on their  
frontiers with those troops, to prevent incur­  
sions, demolish those forts, and order the  
troops into the heart of the country, that the  
savages may be encouraged to attack tta  
frontiers, and that the troops may be pro  
tested by the inhabitants: This will fecm o  
prcceed from your ill will or your ignerance,  
and contribute farther to produce and  
strengthen an opinion among them, that you  
are no longer fit to govern them.  
XX. Lastly, invert the Gencial of your  
army in the provinces with great and un*  
conftitmional powers, and fee him (rom  
the controul of even your ow i civil gover­

command, with ail the fortrefles in his poi­

vincial Generals in the Roman Empire, and  
encouraged by the uinverfal difeentent you  
have produced) he may take it intoh shred  
to set up for himfelf. If he (hould, and yc u  
have carefully prafliied these few excellent  
rules of mine, take my woid for it, all the  
provinces will immediately join him, and you  
will that day (if you have not done it fuoncr)  
get rid of the trouble of governing them, and

that much of the ftrength of government depends on the opi-

rulers placed immediately over them. If you fend them wife

lonifts, and advance their profperity ; they will think their king  
wife and good, and that he wifhes the welfare of his fubjetts,  
If you fend them learned and upright men for judges, they will  
think him a lover of juftice—This may attach your provinces  
more to his government. You are therefore to be careful who  
you recommend for thofe offices.—If you can find prodigals who  
have ruined their fortunes, broken gamefters or ftock-jobbers;  
thefe may do well as governors ; for they will probably be ra-  
pacious, and provoke the people by their extortion. Wrangling  
proétors and pettyfogging lawyers too are not amifs ; for they  
will be for ever difputing and quarrelling with their little par-  
liaments. if withal they fhould be ignorant, wrong-headed and  
infolent, fo much the better.—Attorneys clerks and Newgate  
folicitors will do for chief-juftices, efpecially if they hold their  
places during your pleafure:—and all will contribute to im-  
prefs thofe ideas of your goverment that are proper fora people  
you would with to renounce it.  
  
* Vi. To confirm thefe impreffions, and ftrike them deeper,  
whenever the injured come to the capital with complaints of  
mal-adminiftration, oppreflion, or injuftice ; punifh fuch fuitors  
with long delay, enormous expence, and a final judgment in fa-  
vour of the oppreflor. This will have an admirable effect every  
way. The trouble of future complaints will be prevented, and  
governors and judges will be encouraged to farther acts of op-  
preffion and Injuftice ; and thence the people may become more  
difaffeed, and at length defperate. |  
  
« Vil. When fuch governors have crammed their coffers, and  
made themfelves fo odious to the people that they can no longer  
remain among them with fafety to their perfons ; recal and  
_veward them with penfions. You may make them baronetstoo,  
if that refpeQable order fhould not think fit to refent it. All

_ © VIL. If when you are engaged in war, your colonies fhould  
vie in liberal aids of men and money againfi the common ene-  
my, upon your fimple requifition, and give far beyond their abi-  
lities,—refie&amp;t that a penny taken from, them by your power, is  
more honourable to you than a pound prefented by their beneyo-  
lence ; defpife therefore their voluntary grants, and refolve to  
  
harafs them with novel taxes.—They will probably complain to .  
  
your parliament that they are taxed by a body in which they have  
no reprefentative, and that this is contrary to common right.  
They will’petition for redrefs. Let the the parliament flout their  
claims, reject their petitions, refufe even’ to fuffer the reading  
of them, and treat the petitioners with the utmoft contempt. —  
Nothing can have a better effe&amp; in producing the alienation  
propofed ; for though many can forgive injuries, none ever for-  
gave contempt.  
  
* IX. In laying thefe taxes, never regard the heavy burthens  
thofe remote people already undergo; in defending their own  
frontiers, fupporting their own provincial government, making  
new roads, building bridges, churches, and other public edifi-  
ces ; which in old countries have been done to-your hands, by  
your anceftors$ but which occafion conftant calls and demands  
on the purfes of a new people.—Forget the reftraint you lay on  
their trade for your own benefit, and the advantage a monopoly  
of this trade pives your exa&amp;ting merchants, Think nothing of  
the wealth thofe merchants and your manufaturers acquire by  
the colony commerce; their increafed ability thereby to pay  
taxes at home; their accumulating in the price of their commo-  
dities, moft of thofe taxes, and fo levying them from their con-  
fuming cuftomers: all this, and the employment and fupport of  
thoufands of your poor by the colonifts, you are entirely to for-  
get. But remember to make your arbitrary tax more grievous to  
your provinces, by public declarations importing that your  
power of taxing them ‘has no limits, fo that when you take  
from them without their confent a fhilling im the pound, you  
have a clear right to the other nineteen. This will probably  
weaken-every idea of fecurity in their property, and convince  
them, that under fuch a government they have nothing they  
can call their own ; which can {carce fail of producing the hap=  
pieft confequences !’

felves fo odious to the people that they  
can no longer remain among them with  
fafety to their perfims, recall and reward  
them with penfions. You may make

order ffiould nnt think fit to rtfent it*  
All will contribute to encourage new  
governors in the fame pradice, and make  
the lupreme government detefiable.  
  
“ VIII. If, when you are engaged in  
tvar,your colonies ffiould vie in liberal aida  
of men and money againft the commoa  
enemy, upon your fiinplc rtquifition, and  
give tar beyond their Abilities, rrflv(rt that  
a penny taken from them by your power,  
is more honourable to you than a pound  
prefented by their benevolence ; defpife  
therefore their voluntary gr*ants, and  
rtfolve to harrafs them with novel taxes.  
---They will probably complain to your  
parliament that they aie taxed by a body  
in which they have rm repicfentativc, and  
that this is C( lUrary to common right.  
They will petition for redrefs. Let the  
parliament llont their claims, rcjctfl their  
petitions, refiife even to fuffer the reading  
of them, and treat the petitioners with  
the utrnoft contempt.—Nothing can have  
a better elVe^ in producing tltc alienation  
propol’cd; for, thoug’n maiiy can forgive  
injuries, none ever forgave tontempt.  
  
“ IX* In laying thefe taxes, never regard  
the heavy burdens thofe remote people  
already undergo, in defending their own  
frontiers, fupporting their own provincial  
government, nnaking new ri)ad3, building  
bridges, churcheb, and other public edi¬  
fices, which in old couimies have been  
d(&gt;ne to ybur hands by your anceHors,  
but which occafion conftant calls and  
demands on the purfes of a new people.  
—Forget the rellraint you lay on their  
trade for your own benefit, and the* ad¬  
vantage a monopoly of this trade gives  
your exacting merchants. Think nothing  
of the wealth thofe merchants and your  
manufacturers acquire by the colony  
COFnmerce; their increafed ability thereby  
to pay taxes at home; their accumulating  
in the price of their commodities mofl or  
thofe taxes, and fo levying them from  
their confuming cufiomers : all thi^, and  
the employment and fupport of thoijfands  
of your poor by the cnionifis, you arc  
entiiely to forget. But lernembcr to

to your provinces* by public declarations  
importing, that your pviwtr of taxing  
them has no limits ; fo that when you  
take from them without their confent a  
fliilling in the pound, you have a clear  
right to the other nineteen. This will  
probably weaken every idea of fecurity in  
their property, and convince them, that  
under fuch a government they have no¬  
thing they can call their cum,—which  
can fcarce fail cf producing the happitft

III. Theſe remote provinces have, perhaps, been acqui-  
  
  
ſettlers their anceſtors, without the aid of the mother coun-  
try. If this ſhould happen to increaſe her ſtrength, by their  
growing numbers, ready to join in her wars; her com-  
  
  
and that it entitles them to ſome favour; you are therefore  
  
  
If they happen to be zealous Whigs, friends of liberty,  
nurtured in revolution principles ; remember all that to their  
prejudice, and contrive to puniſh it: for ſuch principles,  
  
  
uſe; they are even odious and abominable. |  
  
IV. However peaceably your colonies have fubmitted to  
your government, ſhewn their affection to your intereſts,  
and patiently borne their grievances, you are to ſuppoſe  
  
  
Quarter troops among them, who by their inſolence may  
provoke the riſing of mobs, and by their bullets and bayo-  
&#x27;nets ſuppreſs them. By theſe means, like the huſband who  
uſes his wife ill from ſuſpicion, you may in time convert  
your ſuſpicions into realities. 3  
  
V. Remote provinces muſt have governors and judges, to  
repreſent the royal perſon, and execute everywhere the dele-  
gated parts of his office and authority. You miniſters know  
that much of the ſtrength of government depends on the  
opinion of the people; and much of that opinion on the  
  
  
will think their king wiſe and good, and that he wiſhes the  
welfare of his ſubjects. If you ſend them learned and upright  
  
  
are therefore to be careful who you recommend for thoſe  
offices, —If you can find prodigals who have ruined their for-  
  
  
as Governors; for they will probably be rapacious, and pro-  
  
  
ments. If withal they ſhould be ignorant, wrong-headed,  
  
  
5+  
and inſolent, ſo much the better. Attorneys clerks and  
| Newgate ſolicitors will do for Chief Juſtices, eſpecially if  
they hold their places during your pleaſure :—and all will  
contribute to impreſs thoſe ideas of your governmetit that  
ate proper for a people you would wiſh to renounce it.  
VI To confirm theſe impreſſions, and ſtrike them deep-  
er, whenever the injured come to the capital with complaints  
of mal - adminiſtration, oppreſſion, or injuſtice, puniſb ſuch  
aitors with long delay, enormous expence, and a fi  
judgement in favour of the oppreſſor: this will have an ad-  
mirable effect every way. The trouble of future complaints  
will be prevented, and governots and judges will be encou-  
raged to farther acts of oppreſſion and injuſtice ; and thence  
the people may become more diſaffeQted, and at length deſ-  
berate. |  
rey II. When ſuch governors have crammed their coffers,  
and made themſelves ſo odious to the people, that they can  
no longer remain among them with ſafety to their perſons ;  
recal and reward them with penfions, You may make them  
baronets too, if that reſpectable order ſhould not think fit  
to reſent it. All will contribute to encourage new gover-  
hors in the ſame practice, and make the ſupreme govern-  
ment deteſtable.  _ | | ODA  
VIII. If when you are engaged in wat, your colofiies  
ſhould vie in liberal aids of nien and woney agairiſt the  
common enemy, upon your ſimple requiſition, and give far  
beyond their abilities, — reflect that a penny taken from  
them by your power, is more honourable to you than a  
pound preſented by their benevolence ; deſpiſe therefore their  
voluntary grants, and teſolve to haraſs them with novel taxes.  
— They &#x27;will probably complaiti .to your parliament, that  
they are taxed by a body in which they have no repreſenta-  
tive, and that this is contrary to common right. They will  
| petition for redreſs. Let the parliament flout their claims,  
feject their petitions, refuſe even to ſuffer the reading of  
them, and treat the petitioners with the utmoſt contempt.  
— Nothing can have a better effect in producing the alie&gt;  
nation propoſed; for though many can forgive injuries,  
* hone ever forgave contempt.  - &lt;A |  
IX. In laying theſe taxes never regard the heavy. burthens  
thoſe remote people already undergo; in defending their own  
frontiers, fupporting their own provincial government, ma-  
* * Fing new roads, building bridges, churches, &#x27; and other pub-  
lic edifices, which in old countries have been done to your

hands by your anceſtors, but which occaſion conſtant calls  
and demands &#x27;on the purſes of a_new people. Forget the  
reſtraint you lay on their trade for your own benefit,  
  
  
acting merchants. Think nothing of the wealth thoſe mer-  
chants and your manufacturers acquire by the colony com-  
merce; their increaſed ability thereby to pay taxes at home;  
  
  
of thoſe taxes, and fo levying them from their conſuming.  
cuſtomers : all this, and the employment and ſupport of  
thouſands, of your poor by the coloniſts, you are entirely to  
forget. But remember to make your arbitrary tax more grie-  
vous to your provinces, by public declarations importing  
that your power of taxing them has 10 limits, ſo that when  
you take from them without their conſent a ſhilling in the  
pound, you have a clear right to the other nineteen, This  
will 7 weaken every idea of ſecurity in their property,  
and convince them, that under ſuch a government they have  
nothing they can call their own; which can ſcarce fail of  
producing the happieſt conſequences! 5 |  
X. Poſlibly, indeed, ſome of them might. ſtill comfort  
themſelves&#x27;and ſay, Though we have no property, we have  
et . ſomething left. that is valuable; we have conſtitu-  
tional liberty both of perſon and of conſcience. This King,  
theſe Lords, and theſe Commons, who it ſeems, are too  
remote from us to know us and to feel for us, cannot  
take from us our habeas corpus right, or our right of  
trial by a jury of our neighbours: they cannot deprive  
us of the exerciſe of our religion, alter our eccleſiaſ-  
tical conſtitution, and compel us to. be papiſts, if they  
pleaſe, or-mahometans.&#x27;—To annihilate this comfort be-  
gin. by laws to perplex their commerce with infinite regula-  
tions, impoſſible to be remembered and obferved: ordain  
ſeizures of their property for every failure ; take away the  
trial of ſuch property by jury, and give it to arbitrary judges  
of your own appointing, and of the loweſt characters in the  
  
  
of the duties or condemnations, and whoſe appointments  
are during pleaſure.— Then let there be a formal declara-  
tion of both houſes, that eppoſition to your edicts is trea-  
ſon, and that perſons ſuſpected of treaſon in the provinces  
may, according to ſome obſolete law, be ſeized and ſent .  
to the metropolis of the empire for trial; and paſs an act  
that thoſe there charged with certain other offences, ſhall be  
N | hi ſent  
  
TH 6  
  
te! away i in chains from their frientls and country to Be  
tried in the ſame manner for felony. Then ere&amp; a new].  
court of inquiſition among them, accompanied by an armed  
force, with inſtructions to tranſport all fuch ſuſpected per-  
  
ſons ; to be ruined by the expence, if they bring over evi-  
dences to prove their innocence; or be und gullty and  
hanged if they cannot afford it. And left the eople mould  
think you cannot poſſibly go any farther, Sal another fo-  
lemn F act, that King, Lords, and Commons,  
had, have, and of fight ought to have, full power and autho-  
c rity. to make ſtatutes of ſufficient force and validity to bind  
&lt; the unfepreſented provinces i# all cafes whatſoever.” This  
will include ſpiritual with temporal, and taken together,  
  
muſt operate wonderfully to your purpoſe; by convincing  
them, that they are at preſent under a power ſomething like  
that ſpoken of in the ſcriptures, which can not ng fi kill  
their bodies, but damn their ſouls to all eternity, by com Yo  
pelling them, if it pleaſes, to worſhip the devil.  
  
XI. To make your taxes more odious, and more likely + to  
procure reſiſtance; ſend from the capital a beard of officers to  
ſuperintend the collection, compoſed of the moſt indijcreet, ill- *  
bred, and infolent you can find. Let theſe have large fala-  
ries out of the extorted revenue, and live in open grating  
luxury upon the ſweat and blood of the induſtrious 3 whom  
they ate to worry continually with groundleſs and expenſive  
proſecutions before the above- mentioned arbitrary revenue-  
Judges ; all at the coſt of the party proſecuted, though ac-  
quitted, becauſe the King is to pay no coſts. Let theſe men  
by your order be exempted from all the common taxes and  
burthens of the province, though they and their property are  
  
rotected · by its laws.---If any revenue officers are ſuſpe&amp;ted  
of the leaſt tenderneſs for the people, diſcard them. If others  
are juſtly complained of, protect and reward them. If any -  
of the under officers behave ſo as to provoke the people to  
  
rub them, promote thoſe to better offices : this will encou-  
rage others to procure for themſelves ſuch profitable drub-  
bings, by multiplying and enlarging ſuch een and  
all will work towards the end you aim at. ä  
  
  
700 the produce of it. &quot;or it. was originally ap propria  
or the defence of the provinces, and the better ſupport of  
E and the adminiſtration of Juſtice where it may  
neceſſary ; then apply none of it to that defence, but be-  
flow i it where it is not neceſſary, in augmenting ſalaries or  
penſions  
  
[16 ]  
penſions to every governor who has diſtinguiſhed himſelf by  
his enmity to the people, and by calumniating them to their  
ſovereign. This will make them pay it mote unwillingly,  
and be more apt to quarrel with thoſe that colle it and thoſe  
that impoſed it; who will quarrel again with them; and all  
ſhall contribute to your own purpoſe, of making them weary  
of your government. | » |  
* III. If the people of any province have been accuſtomed  
to ſupport their own governors and judges to ſatisſaction, you  
are to apprehend that ſuch governors and judges. may be  
thereby influenced to treat the people kindly, and to do them  
Juſtice. This is another reaſon for applying part of that re-  
venue in larger ſalaries to ſuch governors and judges, given,  
as their commiſſions are, during your pleaſure only; forbid-  
ding them to take any ſalaries from their provinces: and  
thus the people may no u hope any kindneſs from their  
ernors, or (in crown caſes) any juſtice from their Judges.  
And as the money thus miſapplied in one province is extorted  
from all, probably all will oat the miſapplication.  
  
XIV. If the parliaments of your provinces ſhould dare to  
claim rights, or complain of your adminiſtration, order them  
to be haraſſed with repeated diſſolutions.---I the ſame men  
are continually returned by new elections; adjourn their  
meetings to&#x27; ſome country village where they cannot be ac-  
commodated, and there keep them during pleaſure ; for this,  
you know, is your prerogative ; and an excellent one it is, as  
you may manage it to promote diſcontents among the peo-  
ple, diminiſh their reſpect, and increaſe their diſaffection.  
  
XV. Convert the brave honeſt officers of your navy into  
pimping tide-waiters and colony-officers of the cy/foms. Let  
thoſe who in time of war fought gallantly in defence of  
the commerce of their countrymen, in peace be taught to prey  
upon it. Let them learn to be corrupted by great and real  
ſmugglers ; but (to ſhew their diligence) ſcour with armed  
boats every bay, harbour, creek, cove, or nook throughout  
the coaſt of your colonies ; ſtop and detain every coaſter,  
every wood-boat, every fiſherman ; tumble theif cargoes  
and even their ballaſt inſide out, and upſide down ; and if  
2 penny worth of pins is found unentered, let the whole be  
ſeized and confiſcated. Thus ſhall the trade of your colo-  
niſts ſuffer more from their friends in time of peace, than it  
did from their enemies in war.---Then let theſe boats&#x27; crews  
land upon every farm in their way, rob their orchards, ſteel  
their pigs and poultry, and infult the inhabitants. If the  
a inured  
  
L  
&#x27; injured and exaſperated farmers, unable to procure other  
  
Juſtice, ſhould attack the aggreſſors, drub them, and burn  
their boats; you are to call this high treaſon and rebellion, or-  
  
  
all the offenders three thouſand miles to be hanged, drawn,  
and quartered,---O! this will work admirably !  
  
XVI. If you are told of di/contents in your colonies, never  
believe that they are general, or that you have given oeca-  
ſion for them; therefore do not think of applying any re-  
medy, or of changing any offenſive meaſure.---Redreſs no  
grievance, leſt they ſhould be encouraged to demand the re-  
dreſs of ſome other grievance. Grant no requeſt that it  
juſt and reaſonable, leſt they ſhould make another that is  
unreaſonable.---Take all your informations of the ſtate of  
the colonies from your governors and officers in enmity with  
them. Encourage and reward theſe leaſing- makers; ſecrete  
their lying accuſations, leſt they ſhould be confuted ; but  
act upon them as the cleareſt evidence---and believe nothing  
you hear from the friends of the people. Suppoſe all ter  
complaints to be invented and promoted by a few fa&amp;tious,  
demagogues, whom if you catch and hang, all would be  
quiet.---Catch and hang a few of them accordingly ; and  
the blood of the martyrs ſhall work miracles in favour of  
your &lt;4 1 |  
  
II. If you ſee rival Ay rejoicing at the proſpect  
  
of your diſunion with your provinces, and endeavouring to  
  
  
complaints of your diſcontented coloniſts, at the ſame time  
  
privately ſtimulating you to ſeverer meaſures z let not that  
alarm or offend you. . Why ſhould it? fince you all mean  
the ſame thing.  
  
XVIII. If any colony ſhould at their #wn © Gabe tat a  
fortreſs to ſecure their port againſt the fleets of a foreign  
enemy, get your governor to betray that fortreſs into your  
hands. Never think of paying what it eoſt the country, for

tthe colony does not enjoy the same  
common rights or the same privileges in  
commerce as the mother-country; and that  
it is governed by severe laws, all of  
your own enacting, without allovring the  
colonists any share in the choice of the  
le gislators. II. -A remote colony has,  
perhaps, been&#x27; acquired, purchased, or  
conquered at the sole expense of the  
settlers or thf »r ancestors, without  
the aid of the mother-country. If this  
should happen to increase her strength,  
by their growing numbers, ready to join  
in her wars; her commerce, by their  
growing demand for her manufactures tor  
her naval power, by greater employment  
for her ships ami seamen, they may  
probably suppose some merit ia tins, and  
that it entitles them to some favour ;  
you are therefore to forget all, or  
resent it, as if they had done you an  
injury. If the colonists happen to be  
zealous Whigs, friends of Liberty,  
nurtured in revolutionary principles;  
Tememlper a[l that to their prejudice,  
and contrive to punish it. III. -However  
peaceablyyour colonists have submitted  
to your government, shown their  
affection to, your interests, and  
patiently borne their grievance«, you  
are to suppose them, always inclined to  
revolt ! and treat! them accordingly ! !  
Quarter troop&#x27;s among them, who, by  
their insolence, may provoke the rising  
of mobs, and by their bullets and  
bayonets suppress them. . iyb-Eemote  
colonies must have Governors and Judges  
to represent the Royal Person, and  
execute every where the delegated parts  
of bis office and authority. You know  
that much of ¡the strength of the  
Government oameads on the opinions of  
tl« people, and much of that opinion ion  
the choice of rulers placed immediately  
over them. If you send them ivis* andT  
good Governors who study the interests  
of the colonists and advance their  
property, they will dunk their King,  
wise and good, and; that he wishes the ;  
welfare of his subjects. If you send  
mern learned ¡and upright men for  
Judges,&quot; they will think him ja lover of  
justice;-maJ ^*»cb your colony more to
