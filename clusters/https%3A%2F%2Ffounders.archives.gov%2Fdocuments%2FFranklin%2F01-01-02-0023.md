e rhymed account of his case and on January 14, 1723, a long essay on religious hypocrites and some comments on Governor Shute’s departure from the colony. As a result James Franklin came under official notice once more. The General Court, censuring the Courant for its tendency to mock religion, reflect on the ministers, and affront the magistrates, forbade him “to print or Publish the New England Courant, or any other Pamphlet or Paper of the like Nature, except it be first Supervised by the Secretary of this Province.” Franklin ignored the order, printed his next issue without the Secretary’s permission, and the week after that published an ironical letter of advice to himself on how to avoid offending the authorities. Ordered arrested for contempt, he went into hiding, and, as Benjamin remembered it, “there was a Consultation held in our Printing House among his Friends what he should do in this Case. Some Propos’d to evade the Order by changing the Name of the Paper; but my Brother seeing Inconveniencies in that, it was finally concluded on as a better Way to let it be printed for the future under the name of Benjamin Franklin.”

uary 11. It opened with an address to the public, only part of which, to judge by its style, was by Benjamin Franklin.  
Having thus provided for the continuation of his paper, James Franklin delivered himself up February 12, and gave his bond to keep the peace. One of his sureties was Thomas Fleet, a contributor to the Courant. The charges were considered by the Grand Jury in May, but no indictment was returned, and the printer was discharged. The Courant, however, continued to appear over Benjamin Franklin’s name until it expired in 1726, although the nominal publisher had run away from Boston in September 1723.  
  
The late Publisher of this Paper, finding so many Inconveniencies would arise by his carrying the Manuscripts and publick News to be supervis’d by the Secretary, as to render his carrying it on unprofitable, has intirely dropt the Undertaking. The present Publisher having receiv’d the following Piece, desires the Readers to accept of it as a Preface to what they may hereafter meet with in this Paper.  
  
Non ego mordaci distrinxi Carmine quenquam,  
Nulla vonenato Litera onista Joco est.  
  
  
  
Long has the Press groaned in bringing forth an hateful, but numerous Brood of Party Pamphlets, malicious Scribbles, and Billingsgate Ribaldry. The Rancour and bitterness it has unhappily infused into Mens minds, and to what a Degree it has sowred and leaven’d the Tempers of Persons formerly esteemed some of the most sweet and affable, is too well known here, to need any further Proof or Representation of the Matter.  
No generous and impartial Person then can blame the present Undertaking, which is designed purely for the Diversion and Merriment of the Reader. Pieces of Pleasancy and Mirth have a secret Charm in them to allay the Heats and Tumors of our Spirits, and to make a Man forget his restless Resentments. They have a strange Power to tune the harsh Disorders of the Soul, and reduce us to a serene and placid State of Mind.  
The main Design of this Weekly Paper will be to entertain the Town with the most comical and diverting Incidents of Humane Life, which in so large a Place as Boston, will not fail of a universal Exemplification: Nor shall we be wanting to fill up these Papers with a grateful Interspersion of more serious Morals, which may be drawn from the most ludicrous and odd Parts of Life.  
As for the Author, that is the next Question. But tho’ we profess our selves ready to oblige the ingenious and courteous Reader with most Sorts of Intelligence, yet here we beg a Reserve. Nor will it be of any Manner of Advantage either to them or to the Writers, that their Names should be published; and therefore in this Matter we desire the Favour of you to suffer us to hold our Tongues: Which tho’ at this Time of Day it may sound like a very uncommon Request, yet it proceeds from the very Hearts of your Humble Servants.  
By this Time the Reader perceives that more than one are engaged in the present Undertaking. Yet is there one Person, an Inhabitant of this Town of Boston, whom we honour as a Doctor in the Chair, or a perpetual Dictator.  
The Society had design’d to present the Publick with his Effigies, but that the Limner, to whom he was presented for a Draught of his Countenance, descryed (and this he is ready to offer upon Oath) Nineteen Features in his Face, more than ever he beheld in any Humane Visage before; which so raised the Price of his Picture, that our Master himself forbid the Extravagance of coming up to it. And then besides, the Limner objected a Schism in his Face, which splits it from his Forehead in a strait Line down to his Chin, in such sort, that Mr. Painter protests it is a double Face, and he’ll have Four Pounds for the Pourtraiture. However, tho’ this double Face has spoilt us of a pretty Picture, yet we all rejoiced to see old Janus in our Company.  
There is no Man in Boston better qualified than old Janus for a Couranteer, or if you please, an Observator, being a Man of such remarkable Opticks, as to look two ways at once.  
As for his Morals, he is a chearly Christian, as the Country Phrase expresses it. A Man of good Temper, courteous Deportment, sound Judgment; a mortal Hater of Nonsense, Foppery, Formality, and endless Ceremony.  
As for his Club, they aim at no greater Happiness or Honour, than the Publick be made to know, that it is the utmost of their Ambition to attend upon and do all imaginable good Offices to good Old Janus the Couranteer, who is and always will be the Readers humble Servant.  
P.S. Gentle Readers, we design never to let a Paper pass without a Latin Motto if we can possibly pick one up, which carries a Charm in it to the Vulgar, and the learned admire the pleasure of Construing. We should have obliged the World with a Greek scrap or two, but the Printer has no Types, and therefore we intreat the candid Reader not to impute the defect to our Ignorance, for our Doctor can say all the Greek Letters by heart

By this time the Reader perceives that more than one  
are engaged in the prefent Undertaking. Yet is there one  
Perton, an inhabitant of this Town Boston, whom we  
honor as a Docter in the Chair or a perpetual Dictator.  
The Society had defing&#x27;d to prefent the Public with his  
Effigies, but that the Limner, to whom he was prefented  
for a Draught of his Countenance, defcryed and this he is  
ready to offer upon Oath) Nineteen Features in his Face,  
more than ever he beheld in any Humane Vifage before.  
which fo raifed the Price of his Picture, that our  
Mafter himself forbid the Extravagance of coming up to  
it. And then befides, the Limner, objected a Schism in  
his face, which splits it from his forehead in a ftrait Line  
down to his Chin, in fuch fort, that Mr. Painter protefts  
it is a double Face, and he&#x27;ll have Four Pounds for the  
Pourtraiture. However, tho&#x27; this double Face has spoilt  
us of a pretty Picture, yet we all rejoiced to fee old Junus  
in our Company.  
There is no Man in Boston better qualified than old Ja­  
nus for a Conranteer, or if you pleafe, an Obserrator, be­  
ing a man of fuch remarkable Opticks, as to look two ways

The present publisher having received the

cept of it as a preface to what they may  
hereafter meet with in this paper:  
AM ego moedaci &lt;ii*tn*xi carmine quonqmam  
mull romeuato litera omistofoeo eat.  
Long has the press groaned in bringing  
forth an hateful, bnt numerous brood of party  
pamphlets, malicious scribbles and billingsgate  
ribaldry. The rancor and bitterness H hss  
unhappily infused into men&#x27;s minds, and to  
what a degree it has soured and leavened the  
tempers of persons formerly esteemed some  
of the most sweet and affable, is too well  
known here to need any further proof or rep­  
resentation of the matter.  
  
No generous and impartial person then can  
blame the present undertaking, which is de­  
signed purely for the diversion and merriment  
of the reader. Pieces of pleasantry and mirth  
have a secret charm in them to allay the heats  
and tumors of our spirits, and to make a man  
forget his restless resentments. They have a  
strange power to tune the harsh disorders of  
the soul, aud reduce us to a Berene and placid  
state of mind.  
  
The main design of this weekly paper will  
be to entertain the town with the most comical  
and diverting incidents of human life, which  
in so large a place as Boston, will not fail of  
a universal exemplification; nor shall we be  
wanting to fill up these papers with a grateful  
interspersion of more serious morals, which  
may be drawn from the most ludicrous and  
odd parts of life.  
As for the author, that is the next question.  
But though we profess ourselves ready to  
oblige the ingenious and courteous reader with  
most sorts of intelligence, yet here we beg a  
reserve. Nor will it be of any manner of ad­  
vantage either to them or the writers, that  
their names should be published; and there­  
fore in this matter we desire the favor of you  
to sufler us to hold our tongues: Which,  
though at this time of day, it may sound like  
a very uncommon request, yet it proceeds from  
the very hearts of your humble servants.  
BytL is time the reader perceives that more  
than one are engaged in the present undertak­  
ing. Yet is there some person, an inhabitant  
of this town of Boston, whom we honor as a  
Doctor in the Chair, or a ptrpetual Dictator.  
The society hnd designed to present the  
public with his etiigies, but that the limner to  
whom he was preferred for a draught of his  
countenance, descryed (and he is ready to off­  
er upon oath) nineteen features in his face,  
more than he ever beheld in any hnman vis­  
age before; which so raised the price of his  
picture, that our master himself forbid the ex­  
travaganco of coming up to it. And then,  
besides, the liinner objected a schism in his  
face, which splits it from his forehead in a  
straight line down to his chin, in snch sort,  
that Mr. Painter protests it is a double face  
and he&#x27;ll have (number of pounds sterling,  
not legible—ED.) for the portraiture. How­  
ever, though this face has spoilt us of a pret­  
ty picture, yet we all rejoiced to see old Fan­  
us in our company.  
There is no man in Boston better qualified  
than old Fnnus for a Couranteer, or if you  
please, an Obtervator, being a man of such re­  
markable optics, as to look two ways at once.  
As for morals, he is a chearly Christian, as  
the country phrase expresses it. A man of

P. S. Gentle readers, we design never to  
let a paper pass without a Latin motto if we  
can possibly pick one up, which carries a  
charm in it to the vulgar, and the learned ad­  
mire the pleasure of construing. We should  
have obliged the world with a Greek scrap or  
two, but the printer haa no types, and there­

id what Philadelphia was ninety years ago,  
and carries us back in imagination lo the  
threshold ot American Independence.  
Mr. Loo. n is lias also eho&#x27;-vn us a f ie Minile  
reprint of The A&#x27;tii&#x27; Pnyland Vourant , printed  
with the same prc-sa and type as that used by  
Benjamin Franklin when he published the  
Courant in (Jueeu street, Boston, in 1723.  
The number before us is tor ti e week endmir  
Feb. 11, 1723.  
The humorous reasons which Franklin  
gives in tins number for issuin ; the paper are  
worth reading, and we reproduce them en­  
tire :  
The late Publisher of this paper, binding so  
many Inconveniences wouid arise by his  
carrying the Manuscripts and publick News  
to be supervis&#x27;d by tiie Secretary, as to ren­  
der his carrying it on unprofitable, has in­  
ttrely dropt ihe Undertaking. T he present  
Publisher having received the following  
Piece, desires the Readers to accept of it as  
a Preface to what they may hereafter mjet  
with in this paper.  
.Von tqo mordact dislrmii Carmine tjucnuuum,  
S&#x27;ulla vonenale LUera onista toco est.  
ONG has the Press groaned in bring­  
ing forth an hateful, but numerous  
Brood of Party Pamphlets, malicious  
Scribbles, and Billinsgate Ribaldry.  
The Rancour and bittern-.&#x27;ss ic has un­  
happily infused into Men&#x27;s minds, and  
to what a Degree it has sowred and  
leaven&#x27;d the Tempers ot Persons for  
merly esteemed some of the most sweet and  
affable, is too well known here, to need any  
further Proof or representation ol tue flatter.  
No generous aud impartial Person then oan  
blame the present Undertaking, which is de­  
signed purely for the Diversion and Merriment  
of the Reader. Pieces of Pleasaney and  
Mirth have a secret Charm in th-tn to allay  
the Heats and Tumours of our Spirits aud to  
make a Man forget his restless Resentments.  
They have a strange Power to tune the harsh  
Disorders of the Soul, and reduce us to a se­  
rene and placid State of Mind.  
The mam Design of this Weekly Paper will  
be to entertain the Town with tho most eomi­  
ieal and diverting Incidents of Humane Lite,  
which in so large a Plaoe as Boston, will not  
tail of a universal Exemplification : Nor shall  
we bo wanting to fill up these papers with a  
grateful Interspersion ot more serious Morals,  
which may be drawn from the most ludicrous  
and odd Parts of Life.  
As for the Author, that is the next Ques­  
tion. But tho&#x27; we proless our selves ready to  
obli &#x27;e the ingenious and Courteous Reader  
with most Sorts of Intelligence, yet l ore wo  
be&quot;- a Reserve. Nor will it be ot any Man  
ner of Advantage either to them or to the  
Writers, that their names should be pub  
lished : and therefore in this Matter we dee. re  
the Favour of you to suffer us to hold our  
Tongues : Which tho&#x27; at this Time of Day it  
may be found like a very uncommon &#x27;Request,  
yet it proceeds from the very hearts ol your  
Humble Servants.  
By this Time tha Reader petoaivua mat  
more than one are engaged in the present Un­  
dertaking. Yet is there one Person, an In­  
habitant of this Town oi Boston, whom we  
  
  
honour as a Doctor in the Chair, or a perpet­  
ual Dictator.  
The Society had design &#x27;d to present the  
Publick with hia Effigies, but that the Limner,  
to whom he waa presented for a Draught ot  
his Countenance, desoryed (and this he ia  
ready to offer upon Oath) .Nineteen Features  
in his Face, more than ever lie behold in any  
Humane Visage before ; which so raised tha  
Price &quot;of his Picture, that our Master himself  
forbid the Extravagance of coming up to it.  
And then besides, the Limner objected a Sch­  
ism in hia face, which splits it from hi Fore­  
head ia a straight Line down to his Chin, in  
such sort, that Mr. Painter protests it Is a  
double Face, and he&#x27;ll have Pour Pounds for  
the Pouraiture. However, tho&#x27; this double  
  
Face has spoilt us of a pretty Picture, yet we j  
all rejoiced to eee old Janus in our Company. I  
There is no man in boston better qualified  
than old Janus for a Couranteer, or if you  
pleane,an Ut&#x27;serrvalor, being a man of socli  
remarkable Optichs as to look two ways at  
once.  
As lor his Morals, ho is a clearly Christian,  
as tho Country Phrase expresses it. A Man  
of good Ten per, courteous Deportment,  
sound Judgment; a mortal Hater of Non­  
sense, Foppery, Fnri8a!ity, and endless Cere­  
mony.As lor his Club, they aim at no greater  
llppines8 or Honour, than the Publick be  
made to know, that it is the utmost of their  
Ambition to attend upon and do all imagina­  
ble good Unices to good old Janus the Cour­  
anteer, who is and always will be the Headers  
humble Servant.  
P. S. Genilo Keuders, we design uever to  
iientie iteuuers, we ueoigu uevei io i

the contrivance was that my old indenture should  
be return’d to me, with a full discharge on the  
back of it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure  
to him the benefit of my service, I was to sign  
new indentures for the remainder of the term,  
which were to be kept private. A very flimsy  
scheme it was; however, it was immediately exe-  
cuted, and the paper went on accordingly, under  
my name for several months.

Upon his brother’s imprisonment, Franklin,

issued that James Franklin should no longer
