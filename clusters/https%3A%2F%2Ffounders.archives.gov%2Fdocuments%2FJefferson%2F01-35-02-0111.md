reaty in giving her up. it is true the treaty was not ratified; but when ratified it is validated retrospectively. we took on ourselves this risk, but France had put more into our hands on the same risk.—I do not know whether the clamour as to the allowance to the French officers of their regular pay has been rectified by a statement that it was on the request of the French Consul &amp; his promise to repay it. so that they cost the US. on this arrangement, nothing.—I am glad to learn from you that the answer to Newhaven had a good effect in Massachusets on the republicans, &amp; no ill effect on the sincere federalists. I had foreseen, years ago, that the first republican president who should come into office after all the places in the government had become exclusively occupied by federalists, would have a dreadful operation to perform. that the republicans would consent to a continuation of every thing in federal hands was not to be expected, because neither just nor politic. on him then was to devolve the office of an executioner, that of lopping of. I cannot say that it has worked harder than I expected. you know the moderation of our views in this business, and that we all concurred in them. we determined to proceed with deliberation. this produced impatience in the republicans &amp; a belief we meant to do nothing. some occasion of public explanation was eagerly desired, when the Newhaven remonstrance offered us that occasion. the answer was meant as an explanation to our friends. it has had on them every where the most wholsome effect. appearances of schismatising from us have been entirely done awa

this effect. for the moment which would convince me that a healing of the nation into one is impracticable would be the last moment of my wishing to remain where I am. (of the monarchical federalists I have no expectations. they are incurables, to be taken care of in a madhouse if necessary &amp; on motives of charity.) I am much pleased therefore with your information that the republican federalists are still coming in to the desired union. the Eastern newspapers had given me a different impression, because I supposed the printers knew the taste of their customers &amp; cooked their dishes to their palates. the palladium is understood to be the Clerical paper, &amp; from the clergy I expect no mercy. they crucified their Saviour who preached that their kingdom was not of this world, and all who practise on that precept must expect the extreme of their wrath. the laws of the present day withold their hands from blood. but lies and slander still remain to them. I am satisfied that the heaping of abuse on me personally has been with the design &amp; the hope of provoking me to make a general sweep of all federalists out of office. but as I have carried no passion into the execution of this disagreeable duty, I shall suffer none to be excited. the clamour which has been raised will not provoke me to remove one more, nor deter me to remove one less than if not a word had been said on the subject. in Massachusets you may be assured great moderation will be used. indeed Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pensylva &amp; Delaware are the only states where any thing considerable is desired. in the course of the summer all which is necessary will be done; and we may hope that this cause of offence being at an end, the measures we shall pursue &amp; propose for the amelioration of the public affairs will be so confessedly salutary as to unite all men not monarchists in principle.—we have considerable hopes of republican Senato

spondence on this matter. On August 26, a  
little more than one month after the letter  
to the New Haven merchants, the President  
wrote as follows from Monticello to Mr  
Levi Lincoln of Massachusetts, the Attor  
ney-General in his Cabinet  
Dear Sir: I am glad to learn from  
you that the answer to New Haven had a good  
effect in Massachusetts on the Republicans  
and no ill effects on the sincere Federalists  
I had foreseen, years ago, that the first  
Republican President who should come  
into office after all the places in the  
Government had become exclusively occu­  
pied by Federalists, would have a dreadful  
operation to perform. That the Republicans  
would consent to a continuation of everything  
in Federal hands, was not to bo expectod, be-  
cause neither just nor politic. On him, then  
was to devolve the offico of an executioner  
that of lopping off. I cannot say that it has  
worked harder than I expected. You know  
the moderation of our views in this business  
and that we all concurred in them  
We determined to proceed with delib­  
ndensalund toltht dtpin foi  
the Republicans, and a belief we meant  
  
a   
to do nothing. Some occasion of public  
explanation was eagerly dosired, when the  
New Haven romonstrance offered us that occa­
