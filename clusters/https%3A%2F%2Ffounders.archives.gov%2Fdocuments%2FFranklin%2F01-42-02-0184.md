ations &amp; Conjectures  
There seems to be a Region high in the Air over all Countries, where it is always Winter, where Frost exists continually, since in the midst of Summer on the Surface of the Earth, Ice falls often from above in the Form of Hail.—  
Hailstones of the great Weight we sometimes find them, did not probably acquire their Magnitude before they began to descend. The Air being 400 times rarer than Water, is unable to support it but in the Shape of Vapour, a State in which its Particles are separated. As soon as they are condensed by the Cold of the upper Regions so as to form a Drop, that Drop begins to fall. If it freezes into a Grain of Ice, that Ice descends. In descending both the Drop of Water and the Grain of Ice, are augmented by Particles of the Vapour they pass thro’ in falling, and which they condense by their Coldness and attach to themselves.  
It is possible that in Summer, much of what is Rain when it arrives at the Surface of the Earth, might have been Snow when it began its Descent; but being thaw’d in passing thro’ the warm Air near that Surface, it is changed from Snow into Rain.  
How immensely cold must be the original Particle of Hail, which forms the Center of the future Hailstone, since it is  
  
capable of communicating sufficient Cold, if I may so speak, to freeze all the Mass of Vapour condensed round it, and form a Lump of perhaps 6 or 8 ounces in weight!  
When in Summer time the Sun is high, and long every Day above the Horizon, his Rays strike the Earth more directly &amp; with longer Continuance than in Winter; hence the Surface is more heated, and to a greater Depth by the Effect of those Rays.  
When Rain falls on the heated Earth, and soaks down into it, it carries down with it a great Part of the Heat, which by that means descends still deeper.  
The Mass of Earth to the depth perhaps of 30 Feet, being thus heated, to a certain degree, continues to retain its Heat for some time. Thus the first Snows that fall in the Beginning of Winter, seldom lie long on the Surface, but are soon melted &amp; absorbed. After which the Winds that blow over the Country on which the Snows had fallen are not rendred so cold as they would have been by those Snows if they had remained. The Earth too, thus uncovered by the Snow, which would have reflected the Sun’s Rays, now absorbs them, receiving and retaining the Warmth they afford. And thus the Approach of the Severity of Winter is retarded; and the extreme degree of its Cold is not always at the time we might expect it, viz. when the Sun is at its greatest Distance, and the Days shortest, but some Time after that Period, according to the English Proverb which says,  
  
As the Day lengthens,  
The Cold Strengthens.—  
  
The Causes of refrigeration continuing to operate, while the Sun returns too slowly &amp; his Force continues too weak, to counteract them.—  
During several of the Summer Months of the Year 1783, when the Effect of the Suns Rays to heat the Earth in these  
  
northern Regions should have been greatest, there existed a constant Fog over all Europe; and great Part of North America. This Fog was of a permanent Nature; it was dry, &amp; the Rays of the Sun seem’d to have little Effect towards dissipating it, as they easily do a moist Fog arising from Water. They were indeed rendred so faint in passing thro’ it, that when collected in the Focus of a Burning Glass they would scarce kindle brown Paper; Of course their Summer Effect in heating the Earth was exceedingly diminished.  
Hence the Surface was early frozen.  
Hence the first Snows remained on it unmelted, and received continual Additions.  
Hence the Air was more chilled, &amp; the Winds more severely cold.  
Hence perhaps the Winter of 1783, 4, was more Severe than any that had happened for many Years.  
The Cause of this Universal Fog is not yet ascertained.  
  
Whether it was adventitious to this Earth, and merely a Smoke proceeding from the Consumption by Fire of some of those great burning Balls or Globes which we happen to meet with in our rapid Course round the Sun, and which are sometimes seen to kindle &amp; be destroy’d in passing our Atmosphere, and whose Smoke might be attracted and retain’d by our Earth: Or whether it was the vast Quantity of Smoke long continuing to issue during the Summer from Hecla in Iceland, and that other Volcano which arose out of the Sea near that Island; which Smoke might be spread by various Winds over the northern Part of the World; is yet uncertain.  
It seems, however, worth the Enquiry, whether other hard Winters recorded in History, were preceded by similar permanent &amp; widely-extended Summer Fogs. Because if found to be so, Men might from such Fogs conjecture the Probability of a succeeding hard Winter, &amp; of the Damages to be expected by the breaking up of frozen Rivers at the Approach of  
  
Spring; and take such Measur

the air over all countries, where it is  
always winter, where froſt exiſts continually, ,  
fince, in the. midſt of ſummer on the ſurface.  
of the earth, ice falls often from above in the  
form of hail.  
  
Hailſtones, of the great weight 1 we ſome-  
times find them, did not probably acquire  
their magnitude before they began to deſcend.  
The air, being eight hundred times rarer than  
  
Water, is unable to ſupport it but in the ſhape  
of vapour, a ſtate in which its particles are  
ſeparated. As ſoon as they are condenſed by  
the cold of the upper region, ſo as to form  
a drop, that drop begins to fall. If it freezes  
into a grain of ice, that ice deſcends. In de-  
  
ſcending, both the drop of water, and the grain  
of ice, are augmented by particles of the va-  
pour they paſs through in falling, and which  
  
they condenſe by their coldneſs, and attach to  
themſelves.  
  
It is poſſible that, in ſummer, much of what  
is rain, when it arrives at the ſurface of the  
earth, might have been ſnow, when it be-  
gan its deſcent; but being thawed, in paſſing  
through the warm air near the ſurface, it is  
Changed from ſnow into rain.

freeze all the maſs of vapour condenſed” round  
it, and form a lump of perhaps fix or eight  
ounces in weight !  
  
When, in ſummer time, the ſun is high, and  
continues long every day above the horizon,  
his rays ſtrike the earth more directly, and with  
longer continuance, than in the winter ; hence,  
the ſurface is more heated, and to a greater  
depth, by the effect of thoſe rays.  
  
When rain falls on the heated earth, and  
ſoaks down into it, it carries down with it a  
great part of the heat, which by that means  
deſcends ſtill deeper.  
  
The maſs of earth, to the depth perhaps of  
thirty feet, being thus heated to a certain de-  
gree, continues to retain its heat for ſome  
time. Thus the firſt ſnows that fall in the be-  
ginning of winter, ſeldom lie long on the ſur-  
face, but are ſoon melted, and ſoon abſorbed,  
After which, the winds that blow over the  
country on which the ſnows had fallen, are not  
rendered ſo cold as they would have heen by  
thoſe ſnows, if they had remained. And thus  
the approach of the ſeverity of winter is re-  
tarded ; and the extreme degree of its cold is

HERE feems to bea regi~  
on higher in the air over  
all countries, where it is al-  
ways winter, where froft exifts  
continually, finee, in the midft  
of fummer, on the furface of  
the earth, ice falls often from  
above in the form of hail.  
Hailftones, of the great  
weight we fometimes find  
them, did not probably ac-  
uire their magnitude before  
they began to defcend. The  
air, being eight hundred times  
rarer than water, it is unable  
to fupport it but in the fhape  
of vapour, a ftate in which its  
particles are feparated. As foon  
as they are condenfed by the  
cold of the upper region, fo  
as to form a drop, that drop  
begins to fall. If it freezes in-  
to a grain of ice, that ice de-  
fcends. In defcending, both  
the drop of water and the grain  
of ice are augmented by parti-  
cles of the vapour they pafs  
through in falling, and which  
they condenfe by their cold-  
sefs, and attach to themfelves.  
It is poffible, that, in fum-  
  
532 Meteorological Imaginations and Conjefures,  
mer, much of what is rain,  
  
when it arrives at the furface  
of the earth, might-have been  
fnow when it began its de-~  
feent; but being thawed in  
paffing through the warm air  
near the furface, it is changed  
from fnow into rain,  
  
How immenfely cold muft  
be the original particle of hail,  
which forms the centre of the  
future hailftone, fince it is ca-  
pable of communicating fuffi-  
cient cold, if I may fo fpeak,  
to freeze all the mats of vapour  
condenfed round it, and form  
a lump of perhaps fix or eight  
ounces in weight!  
  
When, in fummer time, the  
fun is high, did continues  
long every day above the hori-  
zon, his rays ftrike the earth  
more directly, and with longer  
  
continuance, than in the wine . |  
  
ter; hence the furface.is more  
heated, and to a greater depth,  
by the effect of thofe rays.  
  
When rain falls on the heate  
ed earth, and finks down inta  
it, it carries down with it @  
great part of the heat, which  
by that means defcends ftill  
deeper.  
  
The mafs of earth, to the  
depth perhaps of thirty feet,  
being thus heated to a certain  
degree, continues to retain its  
heat for fome time. Thus the  
firft fnows that fall in the be-  
ginning of winter, feldom lie  
long on the furface, but are  
foon melted, and fo abforbed.

HERE feenis to be aregion high.  
  
er in the air over all countries  
where it is always winter, where fro c  
exifls continually, fince, in the mdf  
of fumnmer, on the furtace of the earth,  
ice falls often from above in the form  
of hail.  
  
Hail ones, of the great weight we  
fometimes find them, did not proba-  
bly acquire their magnitude before  
they bevan to defcend. The air, be-  
ime ereht hundred times rarer than  
water, is unable to fupport it, but ia  
the fhape of vapour, a ttate in which  
its particles are feparated. As foon,  
us they are condenfed by the cold of  
the up} yer region, fo asto formadrop,  
that drop ats to fall. fit freezes  
juto a grain of ice, that ice defcends.  
In defcending » both the drop of water  
and the gra n of ice , are au; omented by  
particles of the vapour they pals  
through io falling, and which they  
condenfe by their ‘coldne 4s, and at-  
tach to themfelves.  
  
itis poflible, that, in fammer, much  
of what is rain, wlien it arrives at the  
furface of the earth, might have been  
{now when it began its difc nt; but  
being thawed, in pafling through the  
warm air near the furta ¢, it is chang  
ed, from fnow into rain.  
  
How immentely cold mut be the  
Original particle of hail, which terms  
  
*@ shew  
  
the centre of the future hailftone,  
fince it is capable of communicatin  
fufficient cold, if 1 may fo {peak, to  
freeze all the mafs of vapour condenf-  
ed round it, and form a lump of per-  
haps fix or eight ounces in weight !  
  
When in fummer time, the fun is  
high, and continues long every day  
ubove the horizon, his rays {trike the  
earth more direétly, and w ne longer  
col itinuance, than in the winte hence  
the furface 1s more heated, ah to a  
gr eater depth, by the effect of thefe  
i  
  
WW Vhen rain falls on the heated earth,  
and foaks down into jt, it carries down  
with ita great part of the heat, which  
by that means defcends fill deeper.  
  
The mafs of earth, to the depth of  
perhaps thirty feet, being thus heated  
to a certain degree, continues to re-  
tain its heat for fome time. J hus  
the firft {mows that fall in the begin-  
ning of winter, feidom lie long on the  
furfac -e, but are foon melted, and foon  
abforbed. After which the winds  
that blow over the country on which  
the fnows had fallen, are not render-  
ed fo cold as they would have been  
by thefe fnows, if they had remained.  
And thus the approach of the feveri-  
ty of winter is retarded ; and the ex-  
treine degree of its cold is not always  
at the time we might expect it, viz.

and the day fhorteft, but fome time  
after that period, according to the  
Englith proverb, which fays, ‘* as the  
day lengthens, the cold ftrengthens ;”’  
the caufes of retrigiration continuing  
to operate, while the fun returns too  
flowly, and his force continues too  
weak to counteract them. During  
feveral of the f{ummmer months of 1783,  
whea the effects of the fun’s rays to  
heat the earth in thefe northern re-  
gions thould have been the greateft,  
there exifted a conftant fog over all  
Kurope, and great part of North A-  
mericas ‘Lhis fog was of a permanent  
nature; it was dry, andthe rays of  
the fun, feemed to have little effeét  
towards diflipating it, as they eafily  
doa moift fog, arifing from water.  
They were indeed rendered fo faint  
in pafling through it, that when col-  
le€ted in the focus of a burning glafs  
they would fcarce kindle brown pa-  
per: Of courfe their fummer efiect  
in heating the earth was exceedingly  
diminithed.  
  
Hence the furface was early frozen.  
  
Hence the firit {mows remained on  
it unmelted, aud received continual  
additions.  
  
Hence the air was more chilled, and  
the winds more feverely cold.  
  
Hence perhaps the winter of 1783-4,  
was more fevere than any that had  
happened for many years.

The caufe of this univerfal for is  
not yet afcertained. Whether it was  
adventitious to the earth, and merely  
a {nioke proceeding from the coniump-  
tion by fire of fome of thofe great  
burning balls or globes which we  
happen to meet with in our rapid  
courfe round the fun, and which are  
fometimes feento kindle and be def-  
troyed in pafline our atmofphere, and  
whofe frnoke might be attracted and  
retained by our earth ; or whether it  
was the vaft quantity of fmoke, long  
continuing to iffue during the fummer  
from Hecla in Iceland, and that other  
Volcano which arofe out of the fea  
near that ifland, which fmoke might be  
fpread by various winds over the  
northern part of the world, is yet un-  
certain.  
  
It feems however worth the enqui-  
ry, whether other hard winters re-  
corded in hiffory, were preceded by  
fimilar permanent and widely extend-  
ed fummer fogs. Becaufe, if found to

Hailftones, of the great weight we fome-  
times find them, did not probably acquire  
their magnitude before they began to def-  
cend. ‘The air, being eight hundred times  
rarer than water, is unable to fupport it but

particles are feparated. As foon as they are  
condenfed by the cold of the upper region,

fall, If it freezes into a grain of ice, that  
i¢e defcends. In deftending both the drop  
of water, and the grain ofice, are aug-  
mented by particles of the vapour they  
pafs through in falling, and which they  
condenfe by their coldnefs, and attach to

_ It is poffible that, in fammer much of what  
is rain, when it arrives at the furface of the  
earth, might have been fnow, when it began  
its defcent; but being thawed, in pafling  
through the warm air near the furface, it is  
changed from fnow into rain.  
  
How immenfely cold muft be the original  
particle of hail, which forms the centre of  
the future hailftone, fince it is capable of  
communicating fifficient cold, if I may fo  
Speak, to freeze all the mafs of vapour con-  
  
enfed round it, and form 4 lump of per-

The mafs of the earth, to the

“During several of the summer months of the year 1783, when  
the effects of the sun’s rays to heat the earth in these northern re-

all Europe and great part of North America. This fog was of a

would scarce kindle brown paper. Of course their summer effect  
in heating the earth was excz dingly diminished. Hence the sur-
