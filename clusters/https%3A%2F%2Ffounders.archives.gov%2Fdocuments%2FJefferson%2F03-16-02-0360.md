the constitutional and salutary functions

sonian Democracy, among the first to de-  
nounce the Jaw was Jefferson himself. A  
few months after the passage of the act, he  
made the following remarkable prophecy,  
which entitles us to quote him as one of the  
most far-sighted of the enemies of the spoils

principle of intrigue and corruption which  
will soon leaven the mass not only of Sena-

Grand old Massachusetts has kept unusually clear of such evils,  
but the whole country knows what corruptions, what intrigues and  
— of Senatorial authority, have been thus caused in many  
states.  
  
I am glad to assume there has been no Senatorial pressure in the  
case before us, but we all know that, in a large proportion of removals  
without cause in the country generally, it has been Senators who  
have brought a most selfish and vicious pressure to bear upon th

all the executive offices of the government saps the Constitu-  
tion and the salutary functions of the President, and introduces  
a principle of intrigue and corruption which will soon leaven  
the mass, not only of Senators, but of citizens.”  
  
In the midst of the confusion precipitated by the Chicago  
Convention, this additional reason for concerted action against  
the candidate of that Convention should not be forgotten or  
underestimated—that the success of the ticket would bring  
grave danger to the civil service system, now so admirably per-  
fected. The views of Mr. Bryan accord with the expression  
of the platform. In his speech in the Convention he said:
