Dear Lund,  
New Windsor 30th April 1781  
  
Your letter of the 18th came to me by the last Post. I am very sorry to hear of your loss—I am a little sorry to hear of my own—but that which gives most concern, is, that you should go on board the enemys vessels &amp; furnish them with refreshments. It  
would have been a less painful circumstance to me, to have heard, that in consequence of your non compliance with their request, they had burnt my House, &amp; laid the Plantation in Ruins. You ought to have considered yourself as my representative, and should have reflected  
on the bad example of communicating with the enemy and making a voluntary offer of refreshment to them with a view to prevent a conflagration.  
It was not in your power, I acknowledge, to prevent them from sending a flag on shore—and you did right to meet it—but you should, in the same instant that the business of it was unfolded, have declared, explicitly, that it was improper for you to yield to  
the request—after which, if they had proceeded to help themselves, by force, you could but have submitted (and being unprovided for defence) this was to be prefered to a feeble opposition which only serves as a pretext to burn and destroy.  
I am thoroughly perswaded that you acted from your best judgment—and believe, that your desire to preserve my property, and rescue the buildings from impending danger, were your governing motives—But to go on board their Vessels—carry them  
refreshments—commune with a parcel of plundering Scoundrels—and request a favor by asking the surrender of my Negroes, was exceedingly ill-judged—and ’tis to be feared—will be unhappy in its consequences, as it will be a precedent for others, and may become a subject of  
animadversion.  
I have no doubt of the enemys intention to prosecute the plundering plan they have begun—and, unless a stop can be put to it by the arrival of a superior naval force, I have as little doubt of its ending in the loss of all my Negroes, and in the destruction  
of my Houses—but I am prepared for the event—under the prospect of which, if you could deposit, in safety, at some convenient distance from the Water, the most valuable &amp; least bulky articles, it might be consistent with policy &amp; prudence, and a mean of preserving  
them for use hereafter. such, &amp; so many things as are necessary for common, &amp; present use must be retained &amp; run their chance through the firy trial of this summer.

them with a view to prevent a c mfl vgration.  
  
it was int m your power, i hckho vieuge, to

if they had proceeded to help themselves hy  
farce, you could but have sub nitted; and, bei ig  
unprovided for defense, this was to be preferred  
to a feeble opposition, which only serves as a  
pretext to burn and distroy.  
I am thoroughly persuaded, that you acted  
from your best judgeui :nt, and believe, 11 d  
your desire to preserve my property, and rescue  
the buildings from impending danger, was your  
governing motive; but to go on boar 1 their ves

them with a view to prevent a conflagration. It was not in your  
power, I acknowledge, to prevent them from sending a flag on  
shore, and you did right to meet it; but you should, in the same  
instant that the business of it was unfolded, have declared explicitly  
that it was improper for you to yield to their request; after which, if  
they had proceeded to help themselves by force, you could but have  
submitted ; and being unprovided for defense, this was to be pre-  
ferred to a feeble opposition, which only serves as a pretext to burn  
and destroy.”
