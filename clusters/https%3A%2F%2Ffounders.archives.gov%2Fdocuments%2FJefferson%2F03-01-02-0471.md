I had always cherished the idea that you would fix on that object the measure of your fame, and of the gratitude which our country will owe to you. nor can I yield up this prospect to the secondary considerations which assail your tranquility. for sure I am, they never can produce any other serious effect. your value is too justly estimated by our fellow citizens at large as well as their functionaries to admit any remissness in their support of you. my opinion always was that none of us ever occupied stronger ground in the esteem of Congress than yourself, and I am satisfied there is no one who does not feel your aid to be still as important for the future as it has been for the past. you have nothing therefore to apprehend in the dispositions of Congress, &amp; still less of the President, who, above all men, is the most interested, &amp; affectionately disposed to support you. I hope then you will abandon entirely the idea you expressed to me, &amp; that you will consider the eight years to come as essential to your political career.

lines, in such form as I may forward him by­  
way of answer.  
I have reflected much and painfully on (he  
change of dispositions which has taken place af  
mong the members of the cabinet, since the  
new arrangement, as you stated tome in thcT  
moment of our separation. Itvvouldbe,indeed.:  
a GREAT PUBLIC OALAMITY Were U tO fix VOU  
in the purpose which you seemed to think pos­  
sible. 1 eonsidor the fortunes of our republic  
as depending, in an eminent degree, on the ex­  
tinguishment of the publib debt bciore we en­  
gagod in any war : because, that done, we shal I  
have revenue enough to improve ourcountiv  
in peace, and defend it in war, without recur  
ring either to new taxes or loans. But if tht-i  
debt should once more be swelled to a formida­  
ble size, its entire discharge will be despaired  
  
of, and we shall be committed to the English  
  
career of debt, corruption and rottenness, clo­  
sing with revolution. The discharge of the  
debt, therefore, is vital to the destinies of our.  
  
government, and it hangs on Mr. Madison and  
yourself alone. We shall never 6ee anofheiv  
President and Secretaryjof the Treasury making  
all other objects subordinate to this. Were.  
either of you to be lost to the public, that great.  
  
hope is lost. 1 had always cherished the idea  
that you would fix on that object the measure  
of your fame, and of the gratitude which our  
country will owe you. Nor can I yield up  
this prospect to the secondary consideration  
which assail your tranquility. For sure I am.  
they never) can produee any other serious effect.  
Your value is too justly estimated by our fel­  
low citizens at large, as veil as theii-functionaries  
to admit any remissness in their support  
of you1. My opinion always was, that none ot  
us ever occupied stronger groundin the esteem  
of Congress than yourself, and I am satisfied  
there is no one who does not feel your aid to be  
  
still as important for the fbtw o. unas  
been for theyast. You have nothing, therefore.  
onrpheiid in the dispositions of Congress.  
  
and still less of the President, who, above alL  
  
mo ij the most interested and affectionately  
  
disposed. to support you. I hope, then, yon  
will abandon entirely the idea you expressed  
to me, arid that you will consider the eight years­  
to come as essential to your political career.-.  
I should certainly consider any earlier day of  
your retirement, as ihe most inauspicious dlav  
our new government hasjever seen. In addition  
to the common interest in this question, I feet  
particularly for myself the considerations ol  
gratitude which I personally owe you for your  
valuable aid during my administration of the  
public affairs, a just sense of the laeoe por­

grewfcut of our joint exertions to promote fh
