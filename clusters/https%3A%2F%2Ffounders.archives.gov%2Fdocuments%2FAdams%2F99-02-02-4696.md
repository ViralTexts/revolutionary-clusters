Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Senate  
City of Washington Nov. 26 1800  
  
  
For this excellent address, so respectful to the memory of my illustrious predecessor, which I receive from the Senate of the United States, at this time, and in this place, with peculiar satisfaction, I pray you to accept of my unfeigned acknowledgments.—With you I ardently hope, that permanence and stability will be communicated as well to the government itself, as to its beautiful and commodious seat. With you, I deplore the death of that hero &amp; sage, who bore so honorable and efficient a part in the establishment of both. Great indeed would have been my gratification, if his sum of earthly happiness had been compleated by seeing the government thus peaceably convened at this place, himself at its head. But while we submit to the decisions of heaven, whose councils are inscrutable to us, we cannot but hope, that the members of Congress, the officers of government &amp; all who inhabit the city or the Country will retain his virtues in lively recollection &amp; make his patriotism, morals and piety, models for imitation  
I thank you, Gentlemen for your assurance that the several subjects for Legislative consideration, recommended in my communication, to both houses, shall receive from the Senate, a deliberate and candid attention  
With you, Gentlemen, I sincerely deprecate all spirit of innovation, which may weaken the sacred bond, that connects the different parts of the this nation and government; &amp; with you I trust that under the protection of divine providence, the wisdom &amp; virtue of our citizens, will deliver our national compact unimpaired, to a free, prosperous happy &amp; grateful posterity. To this end it is my fervent prayer, that in this city, the fountains of wisdom may be always open, &amp; the streams of eloquence forever flow. Here may the youth of this extensive Country, forever look up without disappointment, not only to  the monuments &amp; memorials of the dead, but to the examples of the living, in the members of Congress &amp; officers of government, for finished models of all those virtues, graces, talents and accomplishments which constitute the dignity of human nature, &amp; lay the only foundation for the prosperity or duration of Empires.

For this excellent addrefs fo refpectful  
to the memory of my illudrious prede-  
ceffor, which I receive from the Stnate  
of the United States at this time, and in  
this place, with peculiar fatisfaction, I  
pray you to accept my unfeigned acknow-  
ledgements. With you I ardently hope,  
that permanence and ftability will be  
communicated as well to the govern-  
ment itfelf, as to its beautiful and com-  
modious feat. With you I deplore the  
death of that hero and fage who bore fo  
honorable &amp; efficient part in the edablifli-  
ment of both. Great indeed would have  
been my gratification, if his fcene of  
earthly happinefs had been completed by  
feeing the government thus peaceably  
convened at this place, hin.fclf at its  
head. But while we fubmit to the deci-  
iions of heaven, whofe councils are in-  
fcrutable to us, we cannot but hope, that  
the members of congrefs, the officers of  
government, and all who inhabit the city,  
or the country, will retain his virtures in  
lively recollections, and make his patrio- &#x27;  
tifin, morals and piety, models for imita-  
tion.  
  
I thank you, gentlemen, for your affur-  
ance that the feveral fubjecls of legifla-  
tive confideration, recommended in my  
communication to both houfes, fliall re-  
ceive from the fenate a deliberate and  
candid attention.  
  
With you, gentlemen, I fincerely de-  
precate all fpirit of innovation, which&#x27;  
may weaken the facred bonds that con-  
nects the different parts of this nation  
and government, and with you I trud,  
that under the protection of Divine Pro-  
vidence, the wifdom and virture of our  
citizens will deliver our national compact  
unimpaired, to a free, profperous happy  
and greatful poderity. To this end it is  
my fervent prayer, that in this city the  
fountains of vvildom may be always open,  
and the deams of eloquence for ever  
flow. Here may the youth of this ex- ,  
cenlive country for ever look up without  
difappointment, 1 ot only to the monu-  
ments and memorials of the dead, but to  
the examples of the living, in the mem-  
bers of congrefs, and officers of govern,  
ment, for finuhed models of virtues gra-  
ces, talents, and accomplifliments, which  
conftitute the dignity of human nature,  
and lay the only foundation for the pros-  
perity or duration of empires.
