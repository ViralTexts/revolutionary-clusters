Both these were furnished to them, in two several letters of the 8th. and 17th. of April 1815, which are now before the publick. In the first of these letters the attention of the Board is called to three points, “premising that their report will be considered as an authentic source of information, to which a just respect will be paid.” Upon the second point, (the only one with which I have any concern) namely, “The selection of the Officers” after excluding from consideration all “whose misfortune it is, by age, by infirmities, or by wounds to be disabled from rendering further service to their country,” the Acting Secretary of War proceeds to say, “It is the President’s desire upon this important point, that distinguished military merit and approved moral character should form the basis of all the selections which your report shall submit to his consideration. Where in these respects the claims of Officers are equal, length of service, a capacity for civil pursuits, and the pecuniary situation of the parties, may justly furnish considerations to settle the question.”

For, in the letter of the Acting Secretary of war to the Board of Officers, of that date, it is said that “The act of the 3d of March 1815 provides for such number of Hospital Surgeons &amp;c. as the service may require, not exceeding five &amp;c. From this specific arrangement, it is necessarily implied, that—all the Hospital Surgeons &amp;c. except the above specified number, are to be discharged.”  
  
By the new register of the Army accompanying the general orders of the 17th. of May, it appears, that you have deemed it necessary to appoint an Hospital Surgeon, in addition, to the twenty already in service; that t
