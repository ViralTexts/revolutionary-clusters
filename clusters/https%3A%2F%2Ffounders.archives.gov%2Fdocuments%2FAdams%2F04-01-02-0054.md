ever to part with the Shield of Innocence. Tis Expected from you who have a prudence far surpassing your years, that you will make improvements Eaquel to your prudence. From you I expect not the mere common place observation and remarks, but those that will not only please but instruct. What ever occurs curious or remarkable in the Course of your travels remit to your Friends. Here might I be permitted to give my advice, it would be to keep a dayly journal. You will find it  
both useful and pleasent. Permit me also to call to your remembrance those lines of Shakespears, that Excellent advice of Polonius to his Son Laertes  
  
“Give thy thoughts no tongue,  
Nor any unproportioned thought his act  
Be thou familiar; but by no means vulgar.  
The Friends thou hast and their addoption try’d  
Grapple them to thy Soul with hooks of Steel  
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment  
Of Each new hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade  
Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in  
Bear’t that the opposed may beware of thee  
Give every Man thine Ear but few thy voice  
Take Each man’s censure; but reserve thy judgment  
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
But not Express’d in fancy; rich not Gaudy  
For the apparell oft proclaims the man  
Neither a borrower nor a lender be  
For loan oft looses oft itself and Friend  
  
And borrowing dulls the Edge of husbandry  
This above all, to thine own self be true  
And it must follow as the Night the Day  
Thou canst not then be fake to any man.”  
  
I have written a great deal. Receive it in the Spirit of real Friendship. Thus it is designed by Your affectionate Cousin and Friend,  
  
Abigail Adams  
  
  
PS Your Friends here are in as good health as when you left

lieve he is upon the point of turning villain. - - - - - You have seen  
the play of Hamlet, do you remember the advice of Pelonius to his  
son Laertes, going totravel. No; I dare say you did not hear a  
word of it---or if you did, it merely knocked at your dull sense---it  
found no entrance there. I will conclude this letter with it ; and I  
hope you will take every means to imprint it on your memory; write  
it, stick it up over your mantlepiece, and read-it when ever you have  
nothing else to do---and are toasting your shins at the fire ; you can-  
mot employ your memory better than by learning it.  
  
Give thy thoughts no tongue,  
  
Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.

Perhaps the best answer, for a summary one, ever  
given by an uninspired pen, is that of Shakspeare,  
in the advice of Polonius to his son, on going  
abroad : a part of which, I beg leave to quote.  
  
‘Give thy thoughts no tongue,  
Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.  
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.  
The friends thou hast, and their adoption try ’d,  
Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel;  
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment,  
Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d comrade. Beware  
Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,  
Bear it, that the opposer may beware of thee.  
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice.  
Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.  
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;  
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,  
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.  
This above all; tc thine own self be true,  
And it must follow, as the night the day,  
Thou canst not then be false to any man.’ ”

Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no  
  
tongue,  
  
Nor any unproportion’d thought his act. (60)  
  
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.  
  
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption  
  
tried,  
  
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel,  
  
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment  
  
Of each new-hatch’d unfledged comrade.  
  
Beware  
  
Of entrance to a quarrel ; but being in,  
  
Bear ’t, that the opposed may beware of  
  
thee.  
  
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice :  
  
Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy  
  
judgment.  
  
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, (70)  
  
But not expressed in fancy ; rich, not gaudy :  
  
For the apparel oft proclaims the man ;  
  
And they in France of the best rank and  
  
station  
  
Are of a most select and generous chief in  
  
that.”  
  
Recognizing the unfitness of the com-  
monest sense of character (59) you think  
of character in the sense of “ sign” or  
“letter,” and by this inference arrive  
at the meaning of Shakespeare’s word
