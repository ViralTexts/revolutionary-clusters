Quincy June 19th. 1818  
  
I have received your Letter of the 16th. My letter to Col Daniel Putnam of the 5th. is at his and your disposal. You may publish any part of it, or the whole at your discretion.  
I wish the young Gentleman of the Age would undertake an analytical Investigation of the Constitution of the Army at Cambridge and of the detachment from it at Bunkers Hill and Breeds Hill on the 16 and 17th of June.  
The Army at Cambridge was not a National Army, for there was no Nation. It was not a United States Army, for there were no United States. It was not an Army of United Colonies, for if it could be Said in any Sense that the Colonies were United, the Center of their Union, the Congress at Philadelphia, had not adopted nor acknowledged The Army at Cambridge. It was not a New England Army. For New England had not Associated. New England had no legal Legislature, nor any Common executive Authority even upon the Principles of Original Authority or even of Original Power in the People.  
Massachusetts had her Army, Connecticutt her Army; New Hampshire her Army, and Rhode Island her Army. These four Armies met a Cambridge and imprisoned the British Army in Boston. But who was the Sovereign of this united or rather congregated Army; and who its Commander in Chief? It had none. Putnam Poor and Green were as independent of Ward as Ward was of them. None of them but Ward was Subject to the Orders of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. I desire to know from whom Putnam received his Commission and from whom Poor received his Commission? And I pray, let the Commissions of Ward Putnam, Poor and Green, be all produced.  
Where are the Orders for taking Possession of the Heights of Charleston? Who gave those orders? The Massachusetts Provincial Congress? No. They could give no Orders but to General Ward, who could give no orders to Putnam Poor or Green. Were those Orders given by a Committee of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress? But what Authority had that Committee?  
The whole Enterprise in Charleston must have been a Volunteer Enterprize, as the Army at Cambridge was a Volunteer Army.  
Who was the first Officer of Massachusetts on Bunkers Hill or Breeds Hill? I have always understood, he was Collonel Pomroy or General Pomroy. Col. Prescott might be the most determined, persevering and efficatious Officer of Massachusetts, but Pomroy was certainly his Superior in Command.  
But what Authority had Putnam to command Pomroy or Prescott? He offered to Submit to Warren. I am confident the Result will be to the honour of Putnam as a Statesman as well as a Warriour.  
I Should be glad to know by What Authority Gerrish was cashiered? Was it by the Provincial Congress that he was prosecuted, tryed and condemned? General Washington could not order his Tryal, for he had no Authority over him.  
But Sir I must Suppress a thousand questions and conclude Your humble Servant  
John Adam

Dear Sir: I have received your  
letter of the 16th inst. My letter to  
Col. Daniel Putnam, of the 5th, is at  
his and your disposal.  
lish any part of it, or the whole, at

I wish the young gentlemen of the

the army at Cambridge, and of the

and Breed’s Hill on the 16th and 17th  
of June.  
  
The army at Cambridge was not a  
national army, for there was no na-  
tion. It was not a United States  
army, for there were no United States.  
It was not an army of United Colo-

the centre of their union, the con-  
gress at Philadelphia, had not adopted  
nor acknowledged the army at Cam-  
bridge. It was not a New England  
army, for New England had not asso-  
ciated. New England had no legal  
legislature, nor any common execu-  
tive authority, even upon the prin-  
ciples of original authority, or even  
of original power in the people.  
Massachusetts had her army, Con-  
necticut. her army, New Hampshire  
her army, and Rhode Island her  
army. These four armies met at  
Cambridge, and imprisoned the Brit-  
ish army in Boston. But who was  
the sovereign of this united or rather  
congregated army, and who its com-  
mander-in-chief? It had none. Put-  
nam, Poor, and Greene were as in-  
dependent of Ward as Ward was of  
them. None of them but Ward was  
subject to the orders of the Massa-  
chusetts provincial congress. I de-

whom Poor received his commission ?  
And I pray let the commissions of  
Ward, Putnam, Poor, and Greene be  
all produced.  
  
Where are the orders for taking  
possession of the heights of Charles-  
town? Who gave these orders? The  
Massachusetts provincial congress?  
No; they could give no orders but  
to Gen. Ward, who could give no  
orders to Putnam, Poor, or Greene.  
Were those orders given by a com-  
mittee of the Massachusetts provin-  
cial congress? But what authority  
had that committee? The whole en-  
terprise in Charlestown must have  
been a volunteer enterprise, as the  
army at Cambridge was a volunteer  
army.  
  
Who was the first officer of Massa-  
chusetts on Bunker’s Hill, or Breed’s  
Hill? I have always understood he  
was Colonel Pomeroy, or General  
Colonel Prescott might be  
determined, persevering,  
efficient officer of Massachu-  
setts, but Pomeroy was certainly his  
superior in command.  
  
But what authority had Putnam to  
command Pomeroy or Prescott? He  
offered to submit to Warren. Jam  
confident the result will be to the hon-  
our of Putnam both as a statesman  
and I should be glad to  
know by what authority Gerrish was  
vashiered? Was it by the provincial  
congress that he was prosecuted, tried,  
and condemned?  
  
Pomeroy.  
the  
and  
  
most  
  
warriour.  
  
General Washing-  
ton could not order his trial, for he  
had no authority over him. But, sir,  
I must suppress a thousand questions,  
and conclude  
servant,  
  
myself your humble
