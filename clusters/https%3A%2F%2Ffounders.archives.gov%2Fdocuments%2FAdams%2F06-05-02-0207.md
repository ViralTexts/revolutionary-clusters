Tell Mrs. Clymer, that as sure as I am a Prophet, So sure She will live to see the day when she will confess, her Short Exile from Philadelphia, to be among the most fortunate Events of her Life. I am &amp;c.  
In Exchange for your Hessian Psalm, I must give you Mr. Howards Text, the Sunday after the News arrived of the Convention of Sarratoga. It was in 2 Kings. 6. 21. 22. 23. and to save you the Trouble of looking I will transcribe the Words. “And the King of Israel said unto Elisha when he Saw them, My Father, shall I smite them? shall I Smite them? and he answered thou shalt not Smite them: wouldst thou Smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy Sword, and with thy Bow? Sett Bread and Water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their Master. And he prepared great Provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away and they went to their Master: So the Bands of Siria came no more into the Land of Israel.

and 2lst verse of the Second Book of Kings: &quot;And the  
King of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My

this text he preached a long and interesting sermon,  
which was listened to attentively by all present. He  
was several times interrupted by outbursts of applause,  
which he in vain endeavored to stop. He said the
