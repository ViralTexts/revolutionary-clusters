That the said garrison had ammunition and provisions sufficient to have lasted them ten days. That they had reason to expect a reinforcement in a few days which on a requisition from themselves, was actually on it’s way from Montreal, and moreover were so near the main body of the army that they could not doubt being joined by detachments from thence sufficient to oblige the enemy to r

he hands of the enemy, the said enemy murdered two of them, butchering the one with tomahawks and drowning the other; and left divers others exposed in an island naked and perishing with cold and famine.  
That by this time Brigadier General Arnold, who had been detached by Major General Thomas to relieve the fort at the Cedars, approached and was making dispositions to attack the enemy.  
That Captn. Forster thereupon sent a flag to General Arnold, notifying that if he attacked him, the prisoners, then 500 in number, would every man of them be put to death; and proposing at the same time an exchange of [prisoners.]  
[That General] Arnold was ext[reme]ly averse to entering on any agreement of that kind, and was at length induced to do it by  no other motive than that of saving the prisoners from cruel and inhuman death, threatened in such terms as left no doubt it was to be perpetrated.  
That an agreement was thereupon entered into between Brigadr. Genl. Arnold and Capt. Forster, bearing date at St. Anne’s on the 27th. day of May, whereby the said Forster stipulated that he would deliver up all the said prisoners, except such as were Canadians, to Genl. Arnold; who agreed on the other part that so many of equal rank and condition should be returned to the enemy of those taken by our arms on former occasions: that the prisoners so stipulated to be given up to the enemy were not in the possession of Genl. Arnold, nor under his direction, but were at that time distributed through various parts of the continent under the orders of this house.

tee have come to the following resolutions  
Resolved that it is the opinion of this Committee that plundering the baggage of the garrison at the Cedars, stripping them of their clothes and delivering the Prisoners into the hands of the Savages, was a breach of the capitulation on the part of the enemy, for which satisfaction ought to be demanded.  
Resolved that the murder of two of the prisoners of war was a gross and barbarous violation of the laws of nature and nations, for which satisfaction should be made by the enemy by delivering into our hands either Captain Forster, or the individuals concerned in committing the murder.  
Resolved that the agreement entered into at St. Anne’s was a mere sponsion on the part of Brigadr. Genl. Arnold, he not being invested with powers for the absolute disposal of the Continental prisoners in general; and that therefore it is subject to be ratified or annulled at the discretion of this house, the sole representative of the United states of America.  
Resolved that it is the opinion of this Committee that Major Sherburne and his party having fought as men should do, so much of the said sponsion as relates to their exchange should be ratified and confirmed by this house; and that an equal number of captives from the enemy, of the same rank and condition should be restored to them as stipulated by the said sponsion.

Resolved that previous to the delivery of the prisoners to be returned in lieu of Majr. Sherburne and those captivated with him, satisfaction be required from the enemy for the murder of the two prisoners by delivering into our hands Capt. Forster, or the individuals concerned in perpetrating that horrid act; and likewise restitution for the plunder at the Cedars taken contrary to the faith of the capitulation: and that till such satisfaction and restitution be made, the said prisoners be not delivered.  
Resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that if the enemy shall put to death, torture, or otherwise ill-treat any of the hostages in their hands, or of the Canadian or other prisoners captivated by them in the service of the United colonies, recourse must be had to retaliation as the sole means of stopping the progress of human butchery, and that for that purpose punishments of the same kind and degree be inflicted on an equal number of their subjects taken by us, till they shall be taught due respect to the violated rights of nations.

that such a treaty was likely to take place; but,  
I understand now, that the expectation of it is  
over.  
  
I perceive, in the gazette of the Bas Rhine,

the Cedars, in which that respectable body has  
been falsely charged, with violating the treaty,  
in refusing to exchange prisoners, are mistated  
by the omission of this very natural resolution—  
‘“ That the said sponsions be ratified, and an  
equal number of the captives from the enemy, of  
the same rank and condition, be restored to them,  
as stipulated by the said sponsion.”’
