Altho’ I have taken frequent opportunities, both in public &amp; private, of acknowledging your great zeal, attention &amp; abilities in performing the duties of your Office; yet I wish to make use of this last moment of my public life, to signifie in the  
strongest terms my entire approbation of your conduct, and to express my sense of the obligations the public is under to you, for your faithful &amp; meritorious Services.  
I beg you will be convinced, My dear Sir, that I should rejoice if it could ever be in my power to serve you more essentially than by expressions of regard &amp; affection—but in the meantime, I am perswaded you will not be displeased with this farewell  
token of my Sincere friendship &amp; esteem for you.  
This is the last Letter I shall ever write while I continue in the service of my Country—the hour of my resignation is fixed at twelve this day—after which I shall become a private Citizen on the Banks of the Potomack, where I shall be glad to embrace you,  
and testify the great esteem and consideration with which I am—My dear Baron Yr most Obedt &amp; Affecte Servant
