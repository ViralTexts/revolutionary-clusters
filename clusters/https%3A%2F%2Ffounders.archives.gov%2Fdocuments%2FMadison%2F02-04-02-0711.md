 french Government sixty millions of francs, in stock, bearing an interest of six per Cent., and a sum not exceeding twenty millions more to our citizens, in discharge of the debts due to them by France, under the Convention of 1800; and also to exempt the manufactures, Productions &amp; Vessels of France and Spain, in the direct trade from those Countries respectively, in the ports of the ceded territory, from foreign duties, for the term of twelve years. The stock is to be created irredimable for fifteen years, and discharged afterwards in three, in equal annual instalments; the interest on it is to be paid in Europe, and the Principal, in case this Government thinks proper to sell it, disposed of in such manner as will be most conducive to the credit of the american funds. The Debts due to our citizens are to be discharged by Drafts on our Treasury. We omit a more minute view of the stipulations on these Instruments, since, as you will possess them, it is unnecessary.  
Louisiana was acquired of Spain by France, in exchange for Tuscany, which latter is settled by Treaty on the son-in-law of the King of Spain, with the title of King of Etruria, and was estimated in the Exchange, in consideration of its revenue, at 100,000,000 francs. The first Consul thought he had made an advantageous bargain in that exchange, as appears by the high idea which he entertained of its value, as shewn on many occasions. Louisiana was the Territory which he promised in his proclamation at the Peace, as an asylum to those who had become unfortunate by the Revolution, and which he spoke of as vast &amp; fertile. When he made up his mind to offer the Cession of it to the United States, it was contemplated to ask for it 100,000,000₶. exclusive of the debts they owed to our citizens, which they proposed we should also pay, with a perpetual exemption from foreign duties on the manufactures, Productions and Vessels of France and Spain, in the Ports of the ceded Territory. From that demand however, in respect to the sum, he receded, under the deliberation of his own Cabinet; for the first Proposition which Mr. Marbois made to us was that we should pay 80 millions, sixty of which in cash, the balance to our citizens, the whole in one year in Paris, with a perpetual exemption from foreign duties, as above. The modification in the mode of payment, that is by stock, for from the quantum he never would depart, and the limitation of the term of the duties to twelve years, with the proviso annexed to it, which was introduced into the Treaty, with every other change from his project, was the effect of negociation, and accomodation, in which we experienced on his part and that of his Government a promptitude &amp; Candour which were highly grateful to us.
