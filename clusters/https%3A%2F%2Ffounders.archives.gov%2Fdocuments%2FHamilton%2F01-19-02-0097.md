A letter from The Emperor of Morrocco announces to me the renewal of our Treaty and consequently the restoration of peace with that Power. But the instrument for this purpose, which was to pass through the hands of our Minister Resident at Lisbon, who was temporarily absent on business of importance, is not yet received. It is with peculiar satisfaction I can add to this intelligence that an Agent deputed on our part to Algiers communicating that the preliminaries of a Treaty with the Regency of that Country had been settled, and t

of two thirds have advised and consented to its ratification, upon a condition which excepts part of one Article. Agreeably to this advice and consent and to the best judgment I was able to form of the public interest, after full and mature deliberation—I have added my sanction. The result on the part of His Britannic Majesty is unknown. When received, the subject will without delay be placed before Congress.  
This interesting summary of affairs with regard to the foreign Powers between whom &amp; the U S controversies have subsisted and with regard also to those of our Indian Neighbours with whom we have been in a state of enmity or misunderstanding opens a wide field for consoling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every side, the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity, on terms consistent with our national rights and honor, Shall be the happy result—how firm and h

Our agriculture our commerce and our manufactures prosper beyond former example (the occasional depredations upon our Trade however detrimental to individuals being greatly overballanced by the aggregate benefits derived to it from a neutral position). Our population advances with a celerity which exceeds the most sanguine calculations augmenting fast our strength and resources and guaranteeing more and more our national security. Every part of the Union display indications of rapid and various Improvement. With burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived with resources more than adequate to our present exigencies—with a mild constitution and wholesome laws—is it too much to say that our Country affords a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed if ever before equalled

With the review of our army is naturally connected that of our Militia establishment. It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan experience may have unfolded, what improvements will comport with the progress of public opinion. The subject is of so much magnitude in my estimation as to beg a constant solicitude that the consideration of it may be renewed till the greatest attainable degree of perfection is accomplished. Time, while it may furnish others is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object. None better deserves the presevering attention of
