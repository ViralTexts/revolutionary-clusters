What !—will a man play tricks, will he indulge  
A silly fond conceit of his fair form  
  
And just proportion, fashionable mien  
  
And pretty face, in presence of his God ?  
  
Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,  
  
As with the diamond on his lily hand,  
  
And play his brilliant parts before my eyes  
When I am hungry for the bread of life?  
  
He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames  
His noble office, and, instead of truth,  
Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock.  
Therefore avaunt all attitude, and stare,  
And start theatric, practiced at the glass !  
  
I seek divine simplicity in him,  
  
Who handles things divine.’
