earlier period than the one I am now writing.  
At the time it was written, the thoughts which I am now about to disclose to you were  
not even in embryo; and whether, in the opinion of others, there be impropriety, or not,  
in communicating the object which has given birth to them, is not for me to decide. My  
own mind reproaches me with none, but if yours should view the subject differently, burn  
this letter and the draught which accompanies it, and the whole  
matter will be consigned to oblivion.  
All my landed property East of the Apalachian Mountains is under Rent, except the  
Estate called Mount Vernon. This, hitherto, I have kept in my own hands; but from my  
present situation; from my advanced time of my life; from a wish to live free from care,  
and as much at my ease as possible during the remainder of it; &amp; from other causes  
which are not necessary to detail, I have, latterly, entertained serious thoughts of  
letting this estate also—reserving the mansion house farm for my own  
residence—occupation—and amusement in agriculture—provided I can obtain what in my own  
judgment, and in the opinion of others whom I have consulted the low Rent which I shall  
mention hereafter—&amp; provided also I can settle it with good  
farmers.  
The quantity of ploughable land (including meadows)—the relative situation of the farms  
to one another; and the division of these farms into seperate inclosures; with the  
quantity &amp; situation of the Woodland appertaining to the tract, will be better  
delineated by the sketch herewith sent (which is made from actual surveys, subject  
nevertheless to revision &amp; correction) than by a volume of words.  
No estate in United America is more pleasantly situated than this—It lyes in a high,  
dry &amp; healthy country, 300 miles by water from the Sea—and, as you will see by the  
plan, on one of the finest Rivers in the world. Its margin is washed by more than ten  
miles of tidewater; from the bed of which, and the enumerable coves, inlets &amp; small  
marshes with which it abounds, an inexhaustable fund of rich mud may be drawn as a  
manure; either to be used seperately, or in a compost, according to the Judgment of the  
farmer. It is situated in a latitude between the extremes of heat &amp; cold, and is the  
same distance by land &amp; water, with good roads &amp; the best navigation (to &amp;)  
from the Federal City, Alexandria &amp; George town; distant from the first twelve, from  
the second nine, and from the last sixteen miles. The federal City in the year 1800,  
will become the seat of the general Goverment of the United States. It is increasing  
fast in buildings, and rising into consequence; and will, I have no doubt, from the  
advantages given to it by nature, and its proximity to a rich interior country and the  
western territory, become the emporium of the United States.  
  
The Soil of the tract I am speaking, is a good loam, more inclined however to Clay than  
sand. From use, and I might add abuse, it is become more &amp; more consolidated, and of  
course heavier to work. The greater part is a greyish clay—some  
part is a dark mould—a very little is inclined to sand—and scarcely any to stone. A  
husbandmans wish would not lay the farms more level than they are, and yet some of the  
fields (but in no great degree) are washed into gullies, from which all of them have  
not, as yet, been recovered.  
This River, which encompasses the land the distance abovementioned, is well supplied  
with various kinds of fish at all seasons of the year; and in the Spring with the  
greatest profusion of Shad, Herring, Bass, Carp, Perch, Sturgeon &amp;ca. Several  
valuable fisheries appertain to the estate; the whole shore in short is one entire  
fishery.  
There are, as you will perceive by the plan, four farms besides that at the Mansion  
house: these four contain 3260 acres of cultivable land—to which some hundreds more,  
adjoining, as may be seen, might be added, if a greater quantity should be required—but  
as they were never designed for, so neither can it be said they are calculated to suit  
tenants of either the first, or of the lower class; because those who have strength  
&amp; resources proportioned to farms of from 500 to 1200 acres (which these contain) would hardly be contented to live in such  
houses as are there on—and if they were to b

I would let these four farms to four substantial farmers, of wealth &amp; strength  
sufficient to cultivate them; and who would insure to me the regular payment of the  
Rents; and I would give them leases for seven or ten years, at the rate of a spanish  
milled dollar, or other money current at the time, in this country, equivalent thereto,  
for every acre of ploughable &amp; mowable ground within the Inclosures of the  
respective farms, as marked in the plan; and would allow the tenants during that period  
to take fuel; and use timber from the Woodland to repair the buildings and to keep the  
fences in order; until live fences could be substituted in place of dead ones; but in  
this case no subtenants would be allowed.

.  
Having said thus much, I am disposed to add further, that it would be in my power, and  
certainly it would be my inclination (upon the principal above) to accomodate the  
wealthy, or the weak handed farmer (and upon reasonable terms) with draught horses,  
&amp; working mules &amp; Oxen; with cattle, Sheep &amp; Hogs; and with such impliments  
of husbandry if they should not incline to bring them themselves, as are in use on the  
farms. On the four farms there are 54 draught horses, 12 working Mules, and a sufficiency of Oxen, broke to the yoke—the precise number  
I am unable at this moment to ascertain as they are comprehended in the agregate of the  
black cattle. Of the latter there are 317. Of sheep 634 of hogs many, but as these run  
pretty much at large in the Woodland (which is all under fence) the number is uncertain.  
Many of the Negroes, male &amp; female, might be hired by the year as labourers, if this  
should be preferred to the importation of that class of people; but it deserves  
consideration how far the mixing of whites &amp; blacks together is advisable;  
especially where the former, are entirely unacquainted  with the latter.  
If there be those who are disposed to take these farms in their undevided state, on the  
terms which have been mentioned; it is an object of sufficient magnitude for them, or  
one of them in behalf of the rest, to come over &amp; investigate the premises  
thoroughly, that there may be nothing to repro[ac]h themselves or me with if (though  
unintentionally) there should be defects in any part of the information herein given—or  
if a society of farmers are disposed to adventure, it is still more incumbent on them to  
send over an Agent for the purposes abovementioned: for with me the measure must be so  
fixed as to preclude any cavil or discussion thereafter. And it may not be malapropos to  
observe in this place, that our Overlookers are generally engaged, &amp; all the  
arrangements for the ensuing Crops are made before the first of  
September in every year; it will readily be perceived then, that if this period is  
suffered to pass away, it is not to be regained until the next year. Possession might be  
given to the Newcomers at the Season just mentioned to enable them to put in their grain  
for the next Crop; but the final relinquishment could not take place until the Crops are  
gathered; which, of Indian Corn (maiz) seldom happens ’till toward Christmas as it must  
endure hard frosts before it can be safely housed.  
I have endeavoured as far as my recollection of facts would enable me, or the documents  
in my possession allow, to give such information of the actual state of the farms as to  
enable persons at a distance to form as distinct ideas as the nature of the thing is  
susceptible short of ones own view. and having communicated the motives which have  
inclined me to a change in my System, I will announce to you the origin of them.  
First—Few Ships, of late, have arrived from any part of G: Britain or Ireland without a  
number of emigrants, and some of them, by report, very respectable &amp; full handed  
farmers. A number of others, they say, are desirous of following; but are unable to  
obtain passages; but their coming in that manner, even if I was apprised of their  
arrival in time, would not answer my views for the reason already assigned—and which, as  
it is the ultimatum at present, I will take the liberty of repeating—namely—that I must  
carry my plan into complete execution, or not attempt it; and  
under such auspices too as to leave no doubt of the exact fulfilment—and  
2dly because from the number of letters which I have received myself (&amp; as it would  
seem from respectible people) enquiring into matters of this sort, with intemations of  
their wishes and even intention of migrating to this County, I can have no doubt of  
succeeding—But I have made no reply to these  
enquiries, or if any, in very general terms, because I did not want to engage in  
corrispondences of this sort with persons of whom I had no knowledge, nor indeed leizure  
for them if I had been so disposed.  
I shall now conclude as I began, with a desire, that if you see any impropriety in  
making these sentiments known  to that class of  
people who might wish to avail themselves of the occasion, that it may be mentioned. By a law, or by some regulation of your government,  
Artizans I am well aware, are laid under restraints; and for this  
reason I have studiously avoided any overtures to Mechanics although my occasions called  
for them—But never having heard that difficulties were thrown in the way of Husbandmen  
by the Government, is one reason for my bringing this matter to your view—a 2d is, that  
having, yourself expressed sentiments which shewed that you had cast an eye towards this  
Country, &amp; was not inattentive to the welfare of it, I was led to make my intentions  
known to you, that if you, or your friends were disposed to avail yourselves of the  
knowledge, you might take prompt measures for the execution. and 3dly I was sure if you  
had lost sight of the object yourself, I could, nevertheless rely upon such information  
as you might see fit to give me, and upon such characters too as you might be disposed  
to recommend.  
Lengthy as this epistle is, I will crave you patience while I add, that it is written  
in too much haste, and under too great a pressure of public business at the commencement  
of an important session of Congress to be correct or properly digested. But the season  
of the year &amp; the apprehension of Ice are hurrying away the last vessel bound from  
this Port to London. I am driven therefore to the alternative of making the matter known  
in this hasty manner, &amp; giving a rude sketch of the farms, which is the subject of  
it—or to encounter delay, the first I preferred. It can hardly be necessary to add,  
that, I have no desire that any formal promulgation of these  
sentiments should be made. To accomplish my wishes,  
in the manner herein expressed would be agreeable to me, and in a way that cannot be  
exceptionable wd be more so. With much estm &amp; regd—I am—Sir Yr Most Obedt Servt

‘* No estate in United America,” (writes Gen. W.,)  
‘‘is more pleasantly situated than this. It lies ina  
high, dry and healthy country, three hundred miles by  
water from the sea, and on one of the finest rivers  
[the Potomac] in the world. Its margin is washed by  
more than ten miles of tide water; from the bed of  
which, and the innumerable coves, inlets, and small  
marshes, with which it abounds, an inexhaustible fund  
of rich mud may be drawn, as a manure, either to be  
used separately, or in a compost, according to the  
judgment of the farmer. It is situated in a latitude  
between the extremes of heat and cold, and is the same  
distance by land and water, with good roads and the  
best navigation (to and) from the Federal City, Alex-  
andria and Georgetown; distant from the first, fifteen,  
from the second, nine, and from the last sixteen miles.  
The Federal City, in the year 1800, will become the  
seat of the General Government of the United States.  
It is increasing fast in buildings and consequence, and  
will, I have no doubt, from the advantages given to it  
by nature, and its proximity to a rich interior country,  
and the western territory, become the emporium of the  
United States.  
  
‘** The soil of the tract of which I am speaking, is a  
good loam, more inclined, however, to clay than sand.  
From use, and I might add abuse, it is become more  
and more consolidated, and of course heavier to work.  
The greater part isa greyish clay; some part is a dark  
mould; a very little is inclined to sand, and scarcely  
any to stone. A husbandma would not wish to lay  
the farms more level than they are, and yet some of  
the fields, (but in no great degree,) are washed into  
gullies, from which all of them have not as yet been  
recovered.  
  
‘This river, which encompasses the land the dis-  
tance above mentioned, is well supplied with various  
kinds of fish, at all seasons of the year; and in the  
spring with the greatest profusion of shad, herrings,  
bass, carp, perch, sturgeon, &amp;c.; several valuable fish-  
eries appertain to the estate ; the whole shore, in short,  
is one entire fishery.  
  
‘‘ There are, as you will see by the plan accompa-  
nying, four farms besides that at the mansion house.  
These four contain three thousand two hundred and  
sixty acres of cultivable land, to which some hundreds  
more adjoining, as may be seen, might be added, if a  
greater number should be required; but as they were  
never designed for, so neither can it be said they are  
  
  
  
caculated to suit, tenants of either the first or of the  
lower class, because those who have the strength and  
resources proportioned to farms of from five hundred to  
twelve hundred acres, (which these contain,) would  
hardly be contented to live in such honses as are  
thereon, * ¥ ’ ™

‘* Having said thus much, I am disposed to add fur-  
ther, that it would be in my power, and certainly it  
would be my inclination, (upon the principle above,)  
to accommodate the wealthy or the weak-handed far-  
mer, (and upon reasonable terms,) with draught hor-  
ses, and working mules and oxen; with cattle, sheep  
and hogs; and with such implements of husbandry, if  
they should not incline to bring them themselves, as  
are in use on the farms. On the four farms there are  
fifty-four draught-horses, twelve working mules, and a  
sufficiency of oxen broke to the yoke; the precise num-  
ber I am unable this moment to ascertain, as they are  
comprehended in the aggregate of the neat cattle; of  
the latter, there are three hundred and seventeen; of  
sheep, six hundred and thirty-four; of hogs, many; but  
as these run pretty much at large in the woodland,  
(which is all under fence,) the number is uncertain.  
Many of the negroes, male and female, might be hired  
by the year as laborers, if this should be preferred to  
the importation of that class of people, but it deserves  
consideration—how far the mixing of whites and blacks  
together is advisable; especially where the former are  
entirely unacquainted with the latter.”

**Ko estate in United America.” said Wash­  
ington, “is more pleasantly situated than  
this. It lies in a high, dry, and healthy  
country, three hundred miles by water from  
the tea, and, as you will see by  
tbeulan, on one of the finest riverain the  
world. Its margin is washed by more than  
ten miles of tide-water; from the bed of  
which, and the innumerable coves, inlets,  
and&#x27; Small murshes, with which itabonnds,  
an inexhaustible fond of rich mud may bo  
diawn, as a manure, either to be need  
separately or in a compost, according to tho  
judgment of the farmer. It is situated in a  
latitude between the extremes of heat and  
cold, and is the same distance by land and  
water, with good roads and the best naviga­  
tion, to and from the Federal City, Alexan­  
dria, and Georgetown; distant from the  
first, twelve; from the second, nine ; and  
from the last, sixteen miles. The Federal  
City, in the year ISOO, will be­  
come the seas of the General  
Government of the United States. It is in­  
ci eating fast in buildings, and rising into  
consequence; and will, 1 have no doubt,  
from tbe advantages given to it by nature,  
and its proximity to a rich interior country;  
and the Western territory, become the em­  
porium of the United States.  
“ The soil of tho tract of which I am speak­  
ing is a good loam, more inclined, however,  
to clay than sand. From nse, and, I might  
add. abuse, it is become more and more con­  
solidated, and, of course, heavier to work.  
  
The greater part is a grayish clay; some part  
I is dark mould; a very Jittle is inclined to  
sand; and scarcely any to stone.  
“ A husbandman’s wish would not lay the  
farms more level than they are; and yet  
tome of the fields, but in no great degree, are  
washed into gullies, from which all of them  
have not as yet recovered.  
“This river, which encompasses the land  
the distance above mentioned, is well sup­  
plied with various kinds of fish at all sea­  
sons of the year; and, in the spring, with  
the greatest prolusion of shad, herring, bass,  
carp, perch, sturgeon, &amp;c. Several valua­  
ble fisheries appertain to the State; the  
whole shore, in short, is one entire fishery.  
‘ There are, as you will perceive by the  
plan, four farms besides that attbemau­  
siou-huuhe; these four contain 3,200 acres  
of cultivable land, to which some hundreds  
more adjoining, as may be seen, might bo

At Philadelphia: “ All my landed property, east of the  
Apalachian mountains, is under Rent, except the estate  
called Mount Vernon. This, hitherto, I have kept in my  
own hands: but from my present situation, from my ad-  
vanced time of life, from a wish to live free from care, and  
as much at my ease as possible, during the remainder of it,  
and from other causes, which are not necessary to detail, I  
have, latterly, entertained serious thoughts of letting this  
estate also, reserving the mansion-house farm for my own  
residence, occupation, and amusement in agriculture; pro-  
vided I can obtain what, in my own judgment, and in the  
opinion of others whom I have consulted, the low rent  
which I shall mention hereafter; and provided also I can  
settle it with good farmers.” — Washington to Arthur Young.  
  
  
  
Extract from the above quoted letter: ‘‘ No estate in United America is  
more pleasantly situated than this. It lies in a high, dry and healthy coun-  
try, 800 miles by water from the sea, and, as you will see by the plan, on  
one of the finest rivers in the world. Its margin is washed by more than  
ten miles of tide-water ; from the bed of which and the innumerable coves,  
inlets, and small marshes, with which it abounds, an inexaustible fund of  
rich mud may be drawn, as a manure, either to be used separately, or in a  
compost, according to the judgment of the farmer. It is situated in a  
latitude between the extremes of heat and cold, and is the same distance by  
land and water, with good roads, and the best navigation (to and) from  
the Federal City, Alexandria, and George-Town ; distant from the first,  
twelve, from the second, nine, and from the last, sixteen miles. The Fed-  
eral City, in the year 1800, will become the seat of the general government  
of the United States. It is increasing fast in buildings, and rising into  
consequence ; and will I have no doubt, from the advantages given to it by  
Nature, and its proximity to a rich interior country, and the western terri-  
tory, become the emporium of the United States. . . . This river, which  
encompasses the land the distance above-mentioned, is well supplied with  
various kinds of fish, at all seasons of the year; and, in the spring, with the  
greatest profusion of shad, herrings, bass, carp, perch, sturgeon &amp;c. Several  
valuable fisheries appertain to the estate; the whole shore, in short, is one

about to disclose to you, were not even in em­

there be impropriety, or not, in communicat­

is not for me to decide. My own mind re­  
proaches me with none; but, if yours should  
view the matter differently, burn this letter  
and the draft which accompanies it, and the  
whole matter will be consigned to oblivion.  
All my landed property east of the Apoala­  
chian Mountains is under rent except the es­  
tate called Mount Vernon. This, hitherto, I  
have kept in my own hands; but from my  
present situation, from my advanced time of
