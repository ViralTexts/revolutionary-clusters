“It is the glory of the British Prince &amp; the happiness of all his subjects that their constitution hath its foundation in the immutable laws of nature and as the supreme legislative as well as the Supreme Executive derives its authority from that Constitution it should seem that no laws can be made or executed that are repugnant to any essential law in nature. Hence a British subject is happily distinguished from the subjects of many other states in a just &amp; well grounded opinion of his own safety which is the perfection of political liberty.” This whole paragraph is James Otis in perfection. the sense

“It is acknowledged to be an unalterable law in nature that a man should have the free use and sole disposal of the fruit of his honest industry subject to no control.“The equity of this principle seems to have been too obvious to be misunderstood by those who framed the Constitution into which it is engrafted as an established law. It is conceived that this principle gave rise in early time to a representation in Parliament where every individual in the Realm has since been and is still considered by acts of Parliament—As present by himself Or by his representative of his own free election; consequently the aid afforded these to the Sovereign is not in the nature of a tribute but the free &amp; voluntary gift of

d have prefered it to independence—but rather than submit to the sovereign authority of parliament I would not only have accepted independence if offer’d but would have fought for it if refused.” page 29th. “My Lord the superintending power of that high court (the parliament) over all his majestys subjects in the empire and all cases which can consist with the fundamental rules of the constitution was never question’d in this province nor as the house conceive in any other—but in all free states the constitution is fix’d it is from thence that the Supreme legislative as well as the Supreme executive derives its authority—neither of them can break through the fundamental rules of the constitution without destroying their own foundation. It is humbly conceived that all his Majestiys happy Subjects in every part of his wide extended dominions have a just &amp; equitable claim to the rights of that constitution upon which a government itself is formed &amp; by which Sovereïgnty &amp; allegiance is ascertained &amp; limited your Lordship, will allow us to say that it is an essential right of a British Subject engrafted into the Constitution or if your Lordship will admit the expression—a sacred &amp; unalienable natural right quietly to enjoy &amp; have the sole disposal of his own property &amp;c” This &amp; all the subsequent paragraphs in this letter are but abridgements of the sentiments uttered by Otis in 1761. in his arguments against the execution of the deterrant Acts of trade. The next letter is to Lord Camden page 33. “If in all free states the constitution is fixed and the supreme legislative power from thence derives its authority can that power overleap the bounds of the constitution without subverting its foundation—? If the remotest Subjects are bound by the ties of allegiance which this people &amp; their forefathers have ever acknowledged are they not by the rules of equity entitled to all the rights of that constitution which ascertains &amp; limits both sovereignty and allegiance? If it is an essential unalterable right in nature engrafted into the British constitution as a fundamental law; &amp; ever held sacred and irrevocable by the subjects within the realm that what is a mans own is absolutely his own &amp; that no man hath a right to take it from him without his consent:—May not the subjects of this province with a decent firmness which has always distinguished the happy subjects of Britain plead &amp; maintain this natural constitution? The superintending authority of his majestys high court of parliament—over the whole empire in all cases which can consist with the fundamental rights of the constitution was never question’d in this Province nor as this house conceive in any other.”  
Here Mr Otis. Mr. Adams &amp; the whole committee are undoubtedly in an error they made too ample a concession: the authority of parliament had always been question’d &amp; always disputed untill the year 1675. when it was denied not only by Gov Winthrop Leverett &amp; the legislature of the colony &amp; it was ever after question’d by the best informed &amp; thinking men both in this province &amp; in many others if not in all “but they intreat Your Lordships reflection one moment on an act of parliament pass’d in the last Session &amp; another in the 4th of his present majestys reign both imposing duties on his subjects in America which as they are imposed for the sole &amp; express purpose of raising a revenue are in effect taxes. The position that taxation &amp; representation are inseparable is founded on the immutable laws of nature—but the Americans had no representation in the parliament when they were taxed are they not then unfortunate then in these instances in having that separated which God &amp; nature had joined? Every other paragraph in the letter is demonstrative of the hand of Otis. page 36th “A power without a check is always unsafe &amp; in some future time may introduce an absolute government into America. The Judges of the land here do not hold their commissions during good behaviour—is it not then justly to be apprehended. that at so great a distance from the throne the foundation of national justice with salaries altogether independent of the people—an arbitrary rule may take effect, which shall deprive a bench of justice of its glory &amp; the people of their security”—.

t is observable that though many have disregarded life &amp; contemned liberty yet there are few men who do not agree that property is a valuable acquisition wh’ ought to be held sacred. Many have fought &amp; bled &amp; died for this, who have been insensible in all other obligations—those who ridicule the ideas of right &amp; justice, faith &amp; truth among men will put a high value upon money— property is admitted to have an existence even in a savage state of nature—the bow the arrow &amp; the tomahawk, the hunting &amp; the fishing ground, are species of property as important to any American savage, as pearls, rubies, &amp; diamonds, are to the Mogul or a nabob in the east, or the lands, tenements, hereditaments, messuages, gold &amp; silver of Europeans. &amp; if property is necessary to the support of savage life it is by no means less so in civil Society—The Utopian Schemes of levelling—&amp; the community of goods are as vissionary &amp; impracticable as those wh’ vest all property in the crown are arbitrary, despotic, &amp; in our government unconstitutional.

uation as we their posterity are. In those times the crown &amp; the ministers of the crown without the intervention of parliament demolished charters &amp; levied taxes on the colonies at pleasure— Gov Andross in the time of James 2—declared that wherever an Englishman sets his foot—all he hath is the Kings. &amp; Dudley declared, at the council board, &amp; even on the sacred seat of justice, that the privilege of englishmen not to be taxed without their consent and the laws of England, would not follow them to the ends of the earth. It was also in those days declared in-council that the Kings subjects in New England did not differ much from slaves—&amp; that the only difference was that they were not bought &amp; sold—But there was even in those times an excellent attorney General. Sir W—Jones who was of another mind &amp; told King James that he no more grant a commission to levy money on his subjects in Jamaica—tho’ a conquored island without their consent by an assembly, than they could discharge themselves from their allegiance to the English Crown. But the misfortune of the colonists at present is—that they are taxed by parliament without their consent. This while the Parliament continues resolved to tax us will ever render our case in one respect—more deplorable &amp; remediless under the best of Kings than that of our ancestors was under the worst. They found relief by the interposition of parliament—lent by the intervention of that very power—we are taxed and can appeal for relief from their final decission to no power on earth—for their is no power on earth above them” For the rest of this admirable letter I must refer you to the printed vol. in which it is found, rich as it is, both in stile &amp; matter: upon an attentive &amp; careful review of all these letters I can find nothing to asc

It is a caufe which the houfe is afur-  
ed your lordfhip has at heart: And  
the paft experience of your patronage,  
and the noble exertions you were  
pleafed to make for them in a late  
time of diftrefs, affords the ftrongeft  
  
eafon to hope that your happy ia-  
  
fluence will ftili be employed in their  
behalf, as far qs your lordfhip wiil  
judge to be right.  
  
If, in all free ftates, the conftitution  
is fixed;- and the fupreme lJegiflative  
power of the nation, from thence de-  
rives its authority: Can that power  
overleap the bounds of their conftitu-  
tion, without fubverting its own foun-  
dation? If the remotelt fubje&amp;ts are  
bound by the ties of allegiance, which  
this people and their forefathers have  
ever acknowledzed ; are they not, by  
the rules of equity, entitled to all the  
rights of that coniftitution, which af-  
certains and limits both fovercignty  
and allegiance. If itis an eflential um-  
alterable right in nature, ingraited in-

irrevocable by the fobje&amp;ts within the  
realm, that ewbat is a man’s own, is ab-  
folutely bis own; and that no man  
hath a right to take it from him with-  
out his confent: May not the fubjects  
of this province, with decent firmnefs,  
which has always diftinguifhed the hap-  
py fubjects of Britain, plead and main-  
tain this natural conititutional right ?  
The fuperintending authority of his  
majefty’s high court of parliament  
over the whole empire, in all cafes  
which can confilt with the fundamen-  
tal rights of the conftitution, was ne-  
ver quettioned in this province, nor,  
as this houfe conceive, in any other:  
But they intreat your: lordthip’s re-  
flection one moment, on an act of  
parliament pafled in the Jalt feflion ;  
and another in the fourth of his prefent  
majefty’s reign; both impofing duties  
on his fabjetts in America, which, as  
they are impofed with the fole and ex.  
prefs purpofesof raifing arevenue, are in  
effe&amp;t taxes. The pofition, that taxa-  
tion and reprefentation are infeparable,  
is founded on the immutable laws of  
nature. But the Americans had no  
reprefentation in the parliament, when  
they were taxed: Are they not then  
unfortunate in thefe inftances, in hav-  
ing that feparated, which God and  
mature had joined. Such are the lo-

ation as we their poſterity are. In thoſe times,  
the crown and the miniſters of the crown, without  
the intervention of parliament, demoliſhed char-  
ters, and levied taxes on the colonies at pleaſure.  
Governor Androſs, in the time of James the ſe-  
cond, declared, that wherever an Engliſhman ſets  
  
  
declared at the council board, and even on the  
  
cred ſeat of —_—_ that the ; privilege of Eng-

iſhmen, not to be taxed without their conſent,  
and the laws of England, would not follow them  
to the ends of the earth. It was alſo, in thoſe  
days, declared in council, that the king&#x27;s ſubjects  
in New-England did not differ much from ſlaves ,  
and that the only difference was, * that they were  
not bought and fold : But there was, even in thoſe .  
times, an excellent Attorney-General, Sir William  
Jones, who was of another mind; and told king  
James, that he could no more grant a commiſſion  
to levy money on his ſubjects in Jamaica, though  
a conquered iſland, without their conſent &#x27;by an  
aſſembly, than they could diſcharge themſelves  
from their allegiance to the Engliſh crown. But  
the misfortune of the coloniſts at preſent is, that  
they are taxed by parliament without their con-  
ſent: This, while the parliament continues re-  
ſolved to tax us, will ever render our caſe, in one  
reſpect, more deplorable and remedileſs, under  
the beſt of kings, than that of our anceſtors was,  
under the worſt. They found relief by the in-  
terpoſition of parliament : But by the interven-  
tion of that very power, we are taxed, and can  
appeal for relief from their final deciſion to no  
power on earth; for there is no power on earth  
above them. J  
The original contract between the King and  
the firſt planters here, was a royal promiſe in be-  
half of the nation, and which till very lately it  
was never queſtioned but the King had a power  
to make; namely, that if the adventurers would,

intentions of the Colonists, and as they contain the substan-  
tial merits of the great cause between the old country and the  
new, it would be unpardonable to omit particulatising the  
purport of them, in any history professing to do justice to  
the parties. In them they deprecated the imputation of act-  
ing under the influence of a peevish or discontented habit, or  
of the least want of veneration for that august body, the par-  
liament of England, whose supreme legislative power over  
the empire they thereby recognized, and whose superintend-  
ing authority, in ajl cases consistent with the fundamental  
rules of the constitution, was, they said, as clearly admitted  
in the province of Massachusetts, as by any in the realm;  
and they presumed that the subjects in every part of the em-  
pire, however remote, had a claim to the advantages of that  
constitution. ‘The spirit of the law of nature and nations;  
they said, declared so ; for it was unreasonable to affirm that  
local or any other circumstances could justly deprive any  
portion of the subjects of a great prince of the full enjoy-  
ment of the rights of that constitution, upon which the go  
vernment itself was founded, and by which sovereignty and  
allesiance were ascertained and limited. ‘That as the legi

AND REVIEW. 273  
  
aaa ot i . ane  
  
  
  
  
  
common right of ali British subjects, they humbly referred to  
inpartial judgment, whether the supreme legislative of the  
empire might rightly leap the bounds of it in the exercise of  
power over the subjects in America, any more than over those  
in Britain.”” They maintained it to be essentially a right that  
a man should quietly enjoy and have the disposal of his own  
property, and that no necessity could render it just or equita-  
le in the nature of things, that the supreme legislative of  
the empire should impose duties, talliages and taxes, inter-  
nal or external, for the sole purpose of raising a revenue  
upon subjects that were not, and considering their local circum-  
stances, could not by any possibility be equally represented ;  
and whose consent, therefore, could not be had in parliament.  
They observed that the great end of government was the  
security of rights and property ; that measures which tended  
to render life and property precarious, tended-to destroy  
them: that a colonist could not be conceived to have any  
property which he might call his own, if it might be granted  
away by any other body without his consent ; and that this  
was in fact done when the act was passed for granting duties  
on paper, glass, and other articles, for the sole purpose of  
raising a revenue in America.
