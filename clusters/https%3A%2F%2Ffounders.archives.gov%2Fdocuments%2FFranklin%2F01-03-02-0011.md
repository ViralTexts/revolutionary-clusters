The second was a contemporary copy, to which Benjamin Franklin himself made two additions. The third manuscript, made early in the nineteenth century, seems to have been intended for Temple Franklin’s edition of his grandfather’s writings. He decided, however, not to include it and the piece remained unknown to the public.

ne fit to diminish the violent natural Inclinations you mention; and if I did, I think I should not communicate it to you. Marriage is the proper Remedy. It is the most natural State of Man, and therefore the State in which you are most likely to find solid Happiness. Your Reasons against entring into it at present, appear to me not well-founded. The circumstantial Advantages you have in View by postponing it, are not only uncertain, but they are small in comparison with that of the Thing itself, the being married and settled. It is the Man and Woman united that make the compleat human Being. Separate, she wants his Force of Body and Strength of Reason; he, her Softness, Sensibility and acute Discernment. Together they are more likely to succeed in the World. A single Man has not nearly the Value he would have in that State of Union. He is an incomplete Animal. He resembles the odd Half of a Pair of Scissars. If you get a prudent healthy Wife, your Industry in your Profession, with her good Œconomy, will be a Fortune sufficient.  
But if you will not take this Counsel, and persist in thinking a Commerce with the Sex inevitable, then I repeat my former Advice, that in all your Amours you should prefer old Women to young ones. You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:  
1. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor’d with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.  
2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.  
3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc’d may be attended with much Inconvenience.  
4. Because thro’ more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin’d to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.  
5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a youn

MY DEAR FRIEND: Marriage is the  
most natural state of man, and therefore  
the state in which all you are most likely  
to find solid happiness. Your reasons  
against entering it at present appear to  
me not well founded. The circumstan­  
tial advantages you have in view by post­  
poning it are not only uncertain, but  
they are small in comparison with that of  
the thing itself--the being marrled and  
  
settled. It is the man and woman united  
  
that makes the complete human being  
Separate, she wants his force of body and  
strength of reason; he, her softness, Sen­  
sibility, and acute discernment. Together  
they are more likely to succeed in the  
world. A single man has not nearly the  
value he would have in that state of  
union. He is an incomplete animal; he  
resembles the odd half of a pair of scis­  
sors. If you get a prudent, healthy wife  
your industry in your profession, with  
her good economy, will be a fortune suf  
ficient  
But if you will not take this counsel  
and persist in bachelorhood, then I repeat  
my former advice, that in all your amours  
you should prefer old women to young  
ones. You call this a paradox and de­  
mand my reasons. They are these  
1. Because as they have more knowl­  
edge of the world and their minds are  
better stored with observations, their  
conversation is more improving and more

2. Because when women cease to be  
handsome they study to be good. To  
maintain their influence over men they

and are the most tender and useful of all  
friends- when you are sick. Thus they  
  
continue amiable, and hence there is  
hardly such a thing to be found as an old

however, may be named: &quot;First, because they  
have more knowledge of the world, and their  
minds are better stored with observations;  
their conversation is more improving and more  
lastingly agreeable. Secondly, because when  
women cease to be handsome they study  
to be good. To maintain their influence  
  
over men they supply the diminution of  
beauty by an augmentation of utility.  
They learn to do a thousand services,  
small and great. Thirdly, because there is no  
hazard of children, which, irregularly produced,  
may be attended with much inconvenience.  
Fourthly, because, through more experience,  
they are more prudent and discreet in conduct­

Seventhly, because the compunction is less.
