Poughkepsie Saturday [19 July 1788]  
I thank you My Dear Sir for yours by the post. Yesterday I communicated to Duer our situation which I presume he will have communicated to you. It remains exactly the same, no further question having been taken. I fear the footing mentioned in my letter to Duer is the best upon which it can be placed; but every thing possible will yet be attempted to bring the party from that stand to an unqualified ratification. Let me know your idea of the possibility of our being received on that plan. You will understand that the only qualification will be the reservation of a right to recede in case our amendments have not been decided upon in one of the modes pointed out in the Constitution within a certain number of years—perhaps five or seven. If this can in the first instance be admitted as a ratification I do not fear any further consequences. Congress will I presume recommend certain amendments to render the structure of the government more secure. This will satisfy the more considerate and honest opposers of the constitution, and with the aid of time will break up the party. Yrs. Affecty

Poughkeepsie, Saturday, July, 1788.  
I thank you, my doar sir, for yours-by tho post. Yes­  
terday 1 communicated to Duer our situation, which 1  
presume lie will have communicated to you. It remains  
exactly the fame. No further question having been  
taken, 1 foar the footing 1 mentioned to Duer is the  
best upon which if can be placed; but every thing pos­  
sible will yet be attempted to bring the parly front that  
stand to unqualified ratification. Let me know your  
idea upon the possibility of our being received on that  
plan. You wi II understand that tho only qualification  
will bo the reservation of a right to recede, in ease out  
amendments have not been decided upon inono of the  
modes pointed out by the C nstitution within a certain  
number ol years, perhaps live or seven. If this can, in  
the first instance, be admitted as a ratification, 1 do not  
fear any lurthor consequences. Cungre-s will, I pie­  
sume, recommend certain amendments to render the  
structure of the Government more secure. This  
will eatisiy the more oonsiderato and honest opposers ot  
tlte Constitution, and with the aid of them will break  
up the party.

PoroHkeErSie, Saturday, July, 1788.  
I thank you, my dear sir, for yours by  
the post. Yesterday I conmunicated to  
Duer our sitnation, which I presume he  
will have communicated to you. It re  
mains exactly the same. No further ques  
tion having been taken, I fear the footing I  
mentioned to Duer is the best upon which  
it can be placed; but every thing possible  
will yet be attempted to bring the party  
from that stand to uaqmualisied ratisication,  
Let me know your idea upon the p­  
ity of our being received on that plan,  
Yo wif undersand that the only tialif  
cation will be the reservation of a right to  
recede, in case our amendments have not  
been decided upon in one of the modes  
pointed out by the Constitution within a  
certain number of years, perhaps five or  
seven. If this can, in the first instance, be  
admitted as a ratification, I do not fear any  
further consequences. Congress will, I pre­  
sume, recommend certain amendments to  
render the constructure of the Government  
more secure. This will satisfy the more
