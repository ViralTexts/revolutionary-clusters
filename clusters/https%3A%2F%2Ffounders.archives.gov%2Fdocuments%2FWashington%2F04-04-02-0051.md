The account given of your tour thro’ Prussia &amp; other States of Germany, to Vienna &amp; back; &amp; of the Troops which you saw reviewed, in the pay of those Monarchs, at different places, is not less pleasing than it is interesting; &amp; must have been as instructive as entertaining to yourself. Your reception at the Courts of Berlin, Vienna, &amp; elsewhere must have been pleasing to you: to have been received by the King of Prussia, &amp; Prince Henry his brother, (who as soldiers &amp; politicians can yield the palm to none) with such marks of attention &amp; distinction, was as indicative of their discernment, as it is of your merit, &amp; will encrease my opinion of them. It is to be lamented however that great characters are seldom without a blot. That one man should tyranise over millions, will always be a shade in that of the former; whilst it is pleasing to hear that a due regard to the rights of mankind, is characteristic of the latter: I shall revere &amp; love him for this trait of his character. To have viewed the several fields of Battle over which you passed, could not, among other sensations, have failed to excite this thought—here have fallen thousands of gallant spirits to satisfy the ambition of, or to support their sovereigns perhaps in acts of oppression or injustice!—melancholy reflection! For what wise purposes does Providence permit this? Is it as a scourge for mankind, or is it to prevent them from becoming too populous? If the latter, would not the fertile plains of the Western world receive the redundancy of the old.

It is one of the evils of democratical governments that the people, not always seeing &amp; frequently mislead, must often feel before they can act right—but then evils of this nature seldom fail to work their own cure. It is to be lamented nevertheless that the remedies are so slow, &amp; that those who may wish to apply them seasonably are not attended to before they suffer in person, in interest &amp; in reputation.
