				I do not write with the ease which your letter of Sep. 18. supposes. crippled wrists and fingers make writing slow and laborious. but, while writing to you, I lose the sense of these things, in the recollection of antient times, when youth and health made happiness out of every thing.

MONTICELLO, OCT. 12, 1823. -  
Dear Sir—ll do not write with the ease  
which your letter of Sept. 18, supposes.  
Crippled wrists and fingers make writing  
slow and laborious; but, while writing to  
you, I lose tke sense of these things, in  
the recollection of ancient times, when  
youth and health made happiness out of  
every thing. I forget for a while the  
hoary winter of age, when we can think  
of mothing but how to keep ourselves  
warm, and how to get rid of our heavy  
hours until the friendly hand of death  
shall rid us of all at once. Against this  
tedium vitae, however, I am fortunately  
meunted on a hobby, which indeed 1  
should haye better managed some 30, or  
40 years ago, but whose casy amble is  
still sufficient to give exerciss and amuse­  
ment 10 an Octogenary rider. This is  
the establishment of an University, on a  
scale more comprehensive, and in a coun­  
try more healthy and central, than our  
old William and Mary, which these ob­  
stacles have long kept in a state of lan­  
guor and inefficiency. . But the tardiness  
with which such works proceed, may  
render it doubtful, whether I shall live to  
~see it go into action.  
s Putting aside these things, however,  
for the present, I write this letter, as due  
to a friendship, coseval with our govern­  
ment, and now attempted to be poisoned,  
when toolate in life to be replaced by  
new affections. I had for some time ob­  
served, in the public papers, dark hints  
and mysterious inuendos of a correspon­  
dence of yours with a friend, to whom  
you had opened your bosom without re­  
serve, and which was to be made public  
. by that friend, or his representative; and  
now it is said to be actually published.—  
It has not yet reached us, but extracts  
have been given, and such as seemed  
most likely to draw a curtain of separa­  
tion between you and myself. Were  
there no other motive, than that of indig­  
nation against the author of this outrage  
on private confidence; whose shaft seems  
to have been aimed at yourself, more par­  
ticularly ; this would make it the duty of  
every honorable mind to disappoint that,  
aim, by opposing to its impression, a  
seven-fold shield of apathy and insensibil­  
ity. With me however no such armour  
is needed. The circumstances of the  
times, in which we have happened to  
live, and the partiality of our friends, at  
a particular period, placed us in a state of  
- apparent opposition, which some might  
suppose to be personal also; and there  
might not be wanting those who wished  
- to make it so, by filling our ears with ma­  
ant falsehoods ; by dressing up hideous  
:g:ntoms of their own creation, present­  
ing them {o you under my namie, to me  
under your’s and endeavoring to instil  
~ into our minds, things concerning each  
‘other, the most destitute of truth. And  
#f there had been at any time a moment  
~ when we were off our guard, and in a

ple make us forget wiiat we had known  
of each other for so many years—and.

have attended™to the workings of the hu­  
man mind, who have seen the false colors  
under which passion sometimes dresses  
the actions and motives of others, have  
seen also these passions subsiding with  
time and reflection, dissipating like mists  
before the rising sun, and restoring to us  
the sight of all things in their true shape

if at our years, we were to go an age  
back, to hunt up imaginary or forgotten  
facts, to disturb the repose’ of affections,  
so sweetening to the evening of our  
lives. &lt;

sion, from the effort now made, to plant  
thorns on the pillow of age, worth and

who have been such for neaxr half a cen­

MONTICELLO, OCT. 12, 1823.  
Dear Sir : I do not write with the ease  
which your letter of September 18, sup­  
poses. Crippled wrists and fingers make  
writing slow and laborious; but, while  
writing to you, I lose the sense of these  
things, iti the recollection of ancient  
times, when youth and health made hap­  
piness out of every thing. I forget for  
a while the hoary winter of age, when we  
can think of nothing but how to keep our­  
selves warm, and how to get rid of our  
heavy hours until the friendly hand of  
death shall rid us of all at once. Against  
this tedium vitre, however, I am fortu­  
nately mounted on a hobby, which indeed  
I should have better managed some SO  
or 40 years ago, but whose easy amble is  
still sufficient to give exercise and amuse­  
ment to an Octogenary rider. This is  
the establishment of an University, on a  
scale more comprehensive, and in a coun­  
try more healthy and central, than our  
old William and Mary, which these ob­  
stacles have long kept in a state of lan­  
guor and inefficiency. But the tardiness  
with which such works proceed, may  
render it doubtful, whether I shall live to  
  
see it go into action.  
Putting aside these things, however,  
for the present, I write this letter, as due  
to a friendship, coeval with our govern­  
ment, and now attempted to be poisoned,  
when too late in life to be replaced by  
new affections. I had for som&lt;j time ob­  
served, in the public papers, dark hints  
and mysterious inuendos of a correspon­  
dence of yours with a friend, to whom  
you had opened your bosom without re­  
serve, and which was to be made public  
by that friend or his representative; and  
now it is said to be actually published.  
It has not yet reached us, but extracts  
have been given and such as seem most  
likely to draw a curtain of separation be­  
tween you and myself. Were there no  
other motive than that of indignation  
against the author of this outrage upon  
private confidence; whose shaft seems  
to have been aimed at yourself, more par­  
ticularly; this would make it the duty of  
every honorable mind to disappoint that  
aim, by opposing to its impression a se­  
ven-fold shield of apathy and insensibili­  
ty. With me, however, no such armor  
is needed. The circumstances of the  
times, in which we have happened to live,  
and the partiality of our friends at a par­  
ticular period, placed us in a state of ap­  
parent opposition,which some might sup­  
pose to be personal also : and there might  
not be wanting those who wished to make  
it so, by filling our ears with malignant  
falsehoods ; by dressing up hideous phan­  
toms of their own creation, presenting  
them to you under my name, to me under  
your’s, and endeavoring to instil into our

were off our guard, in a temper to let the  
whispers of these people make us forget  
what we had known of each other for so  
many years—and years of so much trial  
—yet all men who have attended to the  
workings of the human mind, who have  
seen the false colors under which passion  
sometimes dresses the actions and mo­

sions subsiding with time and reflection,  
dissipating like mists before the rising  
sun, and restoring to us the sight of all

we were to go an age back, to hunt up  
imaginary or forgotten facts, to disturb  
the repose of reflections, so sweetening to

Be assured, my dear sir, that I am in­  
capable of receiving the slightest impres­  
sion, from the effort now made, to plant  
thorns on the pillow of age, worth, and  
wisdom, and to sow tares between friends  
who have been such for near half a cen­  
tury. Beseeching you then not to suffer  
your mind to be disquieted by this wick­

which have never happened, I add sin­

Monticello, October 12, 1823.  
  
Dear Sir: I do not write with the ease  
‘which your letter of September 18, sup-  
|poses. Crippled wrists and fingers make  
writing slow and laborious; but, while:  
writing to you, I lose the sense of these  
  
&#x27;  
  
ithings, in the recollection of ancient times,  
  
when youth and health made happiness out  
of every thing. I forget for a while the  
hoary winter of age, when we can think of  
nothing but how to keep ourselves warm,  
and to get rid of our heavy hours until the  
friendly hand of death shall rid us of all at-  
once. Against this tedium vite however,  
I am fortunately mounted on a hobby,  
which indeed I should have better manag-  
cd some 30 or 40 years ago, but whose  
easy amble is still sufficient to give exer-  
cise and amusement to an Octogenary ri-  
der. This is the establishment of an Uni-  
versity, on a scale more comprehensive,  
and in a country more healthy and central,  
than our old William and Mary, which  
these obstacles have long kept in a state of  
langor and inefficiency. But the tardiness  
with which such works proceed, may ren-  
der it doubtful, whether I shall live to see  
it go into action. 4  
  
Putting aside these things, however, for  
the present, I write this letter, as due to a  
friendship, coeval with our government,  
and now attempted to be poisoned, when

Putting-aside these thingsj however, for the

V some time past observed in the public papers

.: had opened your, bosom without reserve, and  
which was to be made public by that, friend

I disappoint, .that aim, by opposing tb its im­

sensibilitv. With me, however, no such; ar  
mor is&#x27;needed- The circumstances of theK-  
times in which ,we have happened to live, and  
the partiality of our friends at a particular pe­  
&#x27; riod, placed us in a state of apparent opposi­  
tion, which some might suppose to be persbn .

, who wished to make it so,&#x27; by filling our cars  
with malignant falsehoods&quot;;! by dressihgup  
hideousphantoms of their Own creation, pre­  
senting them to yoii under j my name, to me  
under your&#x27;s, and endeavoring to instil mto

most &#x27;destitute of iruth, And if there had  
been at any time a moment when we Were off  
pur guard, and in a temper to let the whisp ers  
of these people make us forget what we had  
known of each other for so many years,- and  
years of so mtich trial--yet all men who hsve

“ Monticello, Oct. 12, 1823.  
  
“Dean Sirn,—I do not write with  
the ease Which your letter of Sept. 1S,  
supposes. Crippled wrists and fingers  
muke writing slow and laborious; but,  
while writing to you, I lose the sense  
of these things, in the recollection of  
ucient times, when youth and health  
made happiness out of every thing.  
| forget tur a while the hoary winter  
of age, When we can think of nothing  
but how to keep ourselves warin, how  
to get rid of our heavy hours until the  
friendly hand of death shall rid us of  
wll at once. Against this tedium vite,  
however, [ am fortunately mounted  
ona hobby, which, indeed, | should  
have better managed some 30 or 40  
vears ago, but whose easy amble is  
still sutiicient to give exercise and  
amusement to an Octogenary rider.  
This is the establishment of an Uni-  
versity, on a scale more comprehen-  
sive, and in a country more healthy  
and central, than our old William and  
Mary, which these obstacles have long  
Kept in a state of languor and inefti-  
ciency. But the tardiness with which  
sueh works proceed, may render, it  
oubtful, whether I shall live to see it  
yo into action.  
  
“Patting aside these things, how-  
‘ver, for the present, I write this let-  
‘er, as due to a friendship, co-eval  
with our government, and now at-  
tempted to be poisoned, when too  
‘ate in life to be replaced by new  
affections. I had for some time ob-  
‘erved, in the publie papers, dark  
hints and tiysterious inuendos of a  
orrespondence of yours with a friend,  
0 en you had opened your bosom  
  
out reserve, and which was to be  
‘made public by that friend or his  
‘epreseutative ; and now it is said to  
&quot;© actually published. It has not yet  
oak &gt;. _ extracts have been  
todren rods h as seemed most likely

iat of indignation against

confidence, whose shaft seems to have  
been aimed at yourself more particu-  
larly ; this would make it the duty of  
every honourable mind to disappoint  
that aim, by opposing to its impres-  
sion a seven-fold shield of apathy and  
insensibility. With me, however, no  
such armour is needed. The cireum-  
stances of the times in which we have  
happened to live, and the partiality of  
our friends, at a particular period,  
placed us in a state of apparent op-  
position, which some might suppose  
to be personal also: and there might  
not be wanting those who wished to  
make it so, by filling our ears with  
malignant falsehoods ; by dressing up  
hideous phantoms of their own cre-  
ution, presenting them to you under  
my name, to me under yours, and  
endeavouring to instil into our minds  
things concerning each other, the most  
destitute of truth. And if there had  
been at any time a moment when we  
were off our guard, and in a temper  
to let the whispers of these people  
make us forget what we had known  
of each other for so many years—and  
years of so much trial; yet all men  
who have attended to the workings of  
the human miad, who have seen the  
false colours under which passion  
sometimes dresses the actions and  
motives of others, have seen also these  
passions subsiding with time and re-  
flection, dissipating like mists before  
the rising sun, and restoring to us the  
sight of all things in their true shape  
and colours. Jt would be strange, in-  
deed, if at our years, we were to vo  
an age back, to hunt up imaginary or  
forgotten facts, to disturb the repose  
of affections, so sweetening to the  
evening of our lives.  
  
‘* Be assured, my dear Sir, that I  
am incapable of receiving the slightest  
impression from the effort now made  
to plant thorns on the pillow of age,  
worth and wisdom, and to sow tares  
between friends who have been such  
for near half a century. Besceching  
you, then, not to suffer your mind to  
be disquieted by this wicked attempt  
to poison its peace, and praying you  
to throw it by among the things which  
have never happened, I add sincere  
assurances of my unabated and con-  
stant attachment, friendship and fe-  
spect. TH. JEFFERSON.

Mosticello, Oct. 12, 1023.  
Dear Srn,  
I do not write with the ease which vonr  
letter of Sept. 18, supposes. Crippled wrists and  
fingers make writing slow and laborious; but  
while writing to you, 1 lose the sense, of these  
things, in £c recollection of ancient times,  
when youth and health made happiness out of  
every thing. I forget for a while, the hoary­  
winter of age, when we can think of nothing but  
how to keep ourselves warm, and how to n-ct  
rid of our heavy hours, until the friendly hand of  
death shall riJ us of all at once. Against this  
tedium vitae, however, lam fortunately moun­  
ted on a hobby, which indeed, I should have  
better managed some 30 or 40 years ago, but  
whose easy amble is still sufficient to give exer­  
cise anil amusement to an Octogenary rider._  
This is the establishment of an university, on a  
scale more comprehensive, anti in a country  
more healthy and central, than our old vVilliatn |  
and .Mary, which these obstacles have long kept  
in a state of langour and inefficiency, ifut the ■  
tardiness with which such works proceed, may j  
render it doubtful, whether I shall live to set !  
it go into action.  
  
rutting aside these things, hoivcvcr, fur the  
present, l write this letter, as due to a friend­  
ship, coeval with pur government, ami now at­  
tempted lobe poisoned, when too late in hie to ^

ed. It has not yet reached 11s, but extracts  
Lave been given, and such as seemed most like­  
ly to draw a curtain of separation between 1  
you and myself. Were there no other motive, I  
than that of indignation against the author of  
1 liia outrage on private confidence; whose shaft  
seems to have been aimed at yourself, more par­  
ticularly; this would make it the duty of every
