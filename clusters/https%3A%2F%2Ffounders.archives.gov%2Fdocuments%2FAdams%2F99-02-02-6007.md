ng out of armed Vessels to defend the Sea Coast of America, and for erecting a Court to try and condemn all Vessels that Shall be found infesting the same.  
Whereas the present Administration of Great Britain, being divested of Justice and Humanity, and Strangers to that Magnanimity, and Sacred Regard for Liberty, which inspired their venerable Predecessors, have been endeavouring thro’ a series of Years, to establish a System of Despotism, over the American Colonies, and by their venal and corrupt Measures, have so extended their Influence over the British Parliament, that by a prostituted Majority, it is now become a political Engine of Slavery; and whereas, the Military Tools of these our unnatural Enemies, while restrained by the united Forces of the American Colonies from proceeding in their Sanguinary Career of Devastation and Slaughter, are infesting the Sea Coasts with armed Vessels, and daily endeavouring to distress the Inhabitants, by burning their Towns, and destroying their Dwellings with their substance, plundering Live Stock, and making captures of Provision and other Vessels, being the Property of said Inhabitants: And Whereas their Majesties King William and Queen Mary, by the Royal Charter of this Colony “for themselves, their Heirs and Successors, did grant establish and ordain, that in the Absence of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the Colony, a Majority of the Council, shall have Full Power by themselves, or by any Chief Commander, or other Officer or Officers, to be appointed by them, from time to time for the special defence of their said Province or Territory, to assemble in Martial Array and put in warlike posture the Inhabitants, of their said Province or Territory, and to lead and conduct them, and with them to encounter, expulse resist and pursue by force of Arms, as well by Sea as by land, within or without the Limits of their said Province or Territory; and also to kill, slay, destroy and conquer, by all fitting Ways, Enterprises and Means whatsoever, all and every such Person and Persons as should at any time thereafter, attempt or enterprize the Destruction, Invasion Detriment or Annoyance of their said Province or Territory, and to take and surprize by all Ways and means whatsoever, all and every Person and Persons with their Ships, Arms, Ammunition, and other Goods, as should in a hostile manner, invade or attempt the invading, conquering or annoying of their said Province or Territory.” And Whereas it is expressly Resolved by The Grand Congress, of America, “that each Colony, at their own Expence, make such provision by armed Vessels, or otherwise, as their respective Assemblies, Conventions or Committees of Safety shall judge expedient and suitable to their Circumstances and Situations, for the protection of their Harbours and Navigation on the Sea Coasts against all unlawfull Invasion, Attacks and Depredation, from Cutters and Ships of War;” and it is the Duty and Interest of this Colony to exert itself, as well for the purpose of keeping Supplies from the Enemy as for those mentioned in the Paragraphs of the Charter and Resolve now recited:  
Therefore, for the more effectually carrying into Execution the purposes  aforesaid;  
Be it enacted, by the Council and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That all armed and other Vessels, which shall be brought into this Colony, and have been found making unlawful Invasions, Attacks, or depredations on the Sea Coasts, or Navigation of any part of America, or improved in supplying the Fleet and Army, which have been, or shall at any time be, employed against the United Colonies, or employed by the said Enemy, in any respect whatsoever; and also all vessels, whose Masters or Supercargoes shall have had designs of carrying Supplies of any kind to the Ennemy, or that shall be returning from the Enemy after having carried such Supplies, and Shall be convicted thereof, as is herein provided, such Vessel or Vessels, with their Appurtenances and Cargoes, Shall be deemed forfeited, and shall be disposed of, as if by this Act hereafter ordered and directed.  
And be it further enacted by the Authortity aforesaid, That the Council of this Colony, or the Major Part of them Shall be fully impowered to commission with Letters of Marque and Reprisal, any Person or Persons, within this Colony, who shall at his or their own Expence fix out and equip, for the defence of America any Vessel, as also any Person who shall by the Owner of such Vessel be recommended therefor; and that all such Persons to be Commissioned as aforesaid, shall have Full Power, with such other Persons, as they shall engage for to their Assistance, to Sail on the Seas, attack, take and bring into any Port in this Colony, all vessels offending or employed by the Enemy as aforesaid; and also to retake and bring in as aforesaid any Vessel or Vessels that may be taken from any Person or Persons by said Enemy.  
Provided always and be it further enacted that the Master; or Owner of such Vessel shall, at the time he receives such Commission, enter into bond with one Sufficient Surety at least, for the faithful discharge of his Office, and observing the Law of this Colony relating to armed Vessels; which Bond shall be in the Form following viz. Know all Men by these Presents, That We A.B. and C.D. of  &amp;c are holden and stand firmly bound and obliged unto the Treasurer and Receiver General of the Colony aforesaid, in the full and just Sum   to be paid unto the Said Treasurer and Receiver General, or to his Successor in said Office: to the true payment whereof, We find Ourselves, our Heirs, Executors and Administrators, jointly and Severally, firmly by these Presents: Sealed with our Seals theday ofAnno Domini 17

I am, Sir
