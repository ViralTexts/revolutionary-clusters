Dec. 2. 06.  
  
To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the US. of America, in Congress assembled.  
Foreign Relations.  
It would have given me, fellow citizens, great satisfaction to announce, in the moment of your meeting, that  
the difficulties in our foreign relations existing at the time of your last separation, had been amicably &amp; justly,  
terminated. I lost no time in taking those measures which were most likely to bring them to such a termination; by special  
missions, charged with such powers &amp; instructions as, in the event of failure, could leave no imputation on either our  
moderation or forbearance.  
England  
the delays which have since taken place in our negociations with the British government appear  
to have proceeded from causes which do not forbid the expectation that during the course of the session, I shall be enabled  
to lay before you their final issue.  
Spain  
what will be that of the negociations for settling our differences with Spain  
nothing which had taken place, at the date of the last dispatches, enables us to pronounce. On the Western side of the  
Missisipi, she advanced in considerable force &amp; took post at the settlement of Bayou Pierre on the Red river. this  
village was originally settled by France, was held by her as long as she held Louisiana, and was delivered to Spain only  
as a part of Louisiana. being small, insulated, &amp; distant, it was not observed at the moment of redelivery to France  
&amp; the United States. that she continued a guard, of half a dozen men which had been stationed there. a proposition  
however having been lately made by our Commander in chief, to assume the Sabine river as a temporary line of separation  
between the troops of the two nations, until the issue of our negociations shall be known, this has been referred by the  
Spanish commandant to his superior, &amp; in the mean time he has withdrawn his force to the Western side of the Sabine  
river. the correspondence on this subject, now communicated will exhibit more particularly the present state of things in  
that quarter.  
The nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual proportion of the force employed there  
should be of cavalry or mounted infantry, in order therefore that the commanding officer might be enabled to act with  
effect, I had authorised him to call, on the Governors of Orleans &amp; Missisipi for a corps of 500. volunteer  
cavalry: the temporary arrangement he has proposed may perhaps render this unnecessary. but I Inform you with great  
pleasure, of the promptitude with which the inhabitants of those territories have tendered their services in defence of  
their country. it has done honor to themselves, entitled them to the confidence of their fellow citizens in every part of  
the Union, &amp; must strengthen the general determination to protect them efficaciously under all circumstances which may  
occur.  
Having recieved information that in another part of the US. a great number of private individuals,  
were combining together, arming &amp; organising themselves contrary to law to carry on a military expedition against the  
territories of Spain I thought it necessary by proclamation, as well as by special orders, to take measures for  
preventing &amp; suppressing this enterprize, for siezing the vessels, arms &amp; other means provided for it, &amp; for  
arresting &amp; bringing to justice it’s authors &amp; abettors. these measures are now in operation. it was due to the good faith which ought ever to be the  
rule of action in public as well as in private transactions, it was due to good order &amp; regular govmt. that  
while the public force was acting strictly on the defensive, and merely to cover our citizens from aggression, the  
criminal attempts of private individuals to decide for their country the question of Peace or War, &amp; by commencg active  
&amp; unauthorised hostilities, should be promptly &amp; effectually suppresse

 to the city  from the Eastern quarter also, will require to be examined for the internal support of the country, the encouragement of a strong settlement on the Western side of the  
Missisipi, within reach of N. Orleans, will be worthy the consideration of the legislature.  
Gun-boats  
The Gun boats authorised by an act of the last session, are so far advanced, that they will be ready for service  
in the ensuing spring. circumstances permitted us to allow the time necessary for their more solid construction. as a much  
larger number will still be wanting to place our seaport towns &amp; waters in that state of defence to which we are  
competent &amp; they entitled, a similar appropriation for a further provision of them is recommended for the ensuing year.  
Fortifications.  
a further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications already established, &amp; the  
erection of such other works as may have real effect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our seaport towns, or  
their remaining before them.  
Insurrection.  
In a country whose constitution is derived from the will of the people, directly expressed by their free  
suffrages, where the principal Executive functionaries, &amp; those of the legislature are renewed by them at short  
periods, where, under the character of jurors, they exercise in person the greatest portion of the judiciary powers, where  
the laws are consequently so formed &amp; administered as to bear with equal weight &amp; favor on all, restraining no man in  
the pursuits of honest industry, &amp; securing to every one the property which that acquires, it would not be supposed that  
any safeguards could be needed against insurrection or enterprize on the public peace or authority. the laws however,  
aware that these should not be trusted to moral restraints alone, have wisely provided punishment for these crimes, when  
committed: but would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission? where an enterprize is  
meditated, by private individuals, against a foreign nation in amity with the US. powers of prevention, to a  
certain extent are given by the laws. would they not be as reasonable &amp; useful where the enterprize preparing is  
against the US.? While adverting to this branch of law, it is proper to observe that in enterprizes meditated  
against foreign nations, the ordinary process of binding to the observance of the peace &amp; good behavior, could it be  
extended to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction of the US. would be effectual in some cases where the  
offender is able to keep out of sight every indication of his purpose which could draw on him the exercise of the powers  
now given by the law.  
Barbary  
The States on the coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at present to respect our peace &amp; friendship.  
with Tunis alone some uncertainty remains. persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with them on equal  
terms, or not at all, I propose to send in due time a reinforcement into the Mediterranean; unless previous information  
shall shew it to be unnecessary.  
Indians.  
We continue to recieve proofs of the growing attachment of our Indian neighbors, &amp; of their disposition to  
place all their interests under the patronage of the US. these dispositions are inspired by their confidence in  
our justice, &amp; in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare. and so long as we discharge these high &amp; honourable  
functions with the integrity &amp; good faith which alone can entitle us to their continuance, we may expect to reap the  
just reward in their peace &amp; friendship.  
Missouri.  
The expedition of Messrs. Lewis &amp; Clarke for exploring the river Missouri, and the best  
communication from that to the Pacific ocean, has had all the success which could have been expected. they have traced the  
Missouri nearly to it’s source, descended the Columbia to the Pacific ocean, ascertained with accuracy the geography of  
that interesting communication across our continent, learnt the character of the country, of it’s commerce &amp;  
inhabitants; &amp; it is but justice to say that Messrs. Lewis &amp; Clarke, &amp; their brave companions, have, by this  
arduous service, deserved well of their country.  
Red river.  
The attempt to explore the Red river, under the direction of mr Freeman, though conducted with a zeal &amp;  
prudence meriting entire approbation, has not been equally succesful. after proceeding up it about 600. miles,  
nearly as far as the French establishments had extended while the country was in their possession, our geographers were  
obliged to return without compleating their work.  
Very useful additions have also been made to our knolege of the Missisipi by Lieutt. Pike, who has  
ascended it to it’s source, &amp; whose journal &amp; map giving the details of his journey, will shortly be ready for  
communication to both houses of Congress. those of Messrs. Lewis, Clarke and Freeman will require further time to be  
digested &amp; prepared. these important surveys, in addition to those before possessed, furnish materials for commencing an  
accurate map of the Missisipi &amp; it’s Western waters. some principal rivers however remain still to be explored, towards  
which the authorisation of Congress, by moderate appropriations, will be requisite  
Slavery.  
I congratulate you, fellow citizens, on the approach of the period; at which you may interpose your authority  
constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of the US. from all further participation in those violations of  
human rights, which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, &amp; which the morality, the  
reputation, &amp; the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe. although no law you may pass can take  
prohibitory effect till the first day of the year 1808: yet the intervening period is not too long to prevent by timely  
notice, expeditions which cannot be compleated before that day.

Dollars; which have enabled us, after meeting the current demands, to pay 2,700,000. D. of the American claims, in part of the price of Louisiana: to pay, of the funded debt, upwards of  
three millions of principal, &amp; nearly four of interest: and, in addition, to reimburse, in the course of the present  
month, near two millions of 5 1/2 per cent stock. These paiments &amp; reimbursements of the funded debt, with  
those which had been made in the four years and an half preceding, will, at the close of the present year, have  
extinguished upwards of twenty three millions of principal.  
The duties composing the Mediterranean fund, will cease, by law, at the end of the present session.  
considering however that they are levied chiefly on luxuries, &amp; that we have an impost on salt, a necessary of life, the  
free use of which otherwise is so important, I recommend to your consideration the suppression of the duties on salt, &amp;  
the continuation of the Mediterranean fund, instead thereof, for a short time, after which that also will become  
unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation.  
When both of these branches of revenue shall, in this way, be relinquished, there will still, ere long, be  
an accumulation of monies in the treasury, beyond the instalments of public debt which we are permitted by contract to  
pay. they cannot then, without a modification, assented to by the public creditors, be applied to the extinguishment of  
this debt &amp; the compleat liberation of our revenues, the most desirable of all objects; nor, if our peace continues,  
will they be wanting, for any other existing purpose. the question therefore now comes forward, to what other objects  
shall these surplusses be appropriated, &amp; the whole surplus of impost, after the entire discharge of the public debt,  
&amp; during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them? shall we suppress the impost, &amp; give that  
advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures? on a few articles of more general &amp; necessary use, the suppression, in  
due season, will doubtless be right. but the great mass of the articles on which impost is paid are foreign luxuries  
purchased by those only who are rich enough to afford themselves the use of them. their patriotism would certainly prefer  
it’s continuance, and application to the great purposes of the public education, roads, rivers, canals, &amp; such other  
objects of public improvement, as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers. by  
these operations, new channels of communication will be opened between the states; the lines of separation will disappear;  
their interests will be identified, &amp; their Union cemented by new &amp; indissoluble ties. education is here placed among  
the articles of public care; not that it would be proposed to take it’s ordinary branches out of the hands of private  
enterprize, which manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal; but a public institution can alone supply  
those sciences, which, tho’ rarely called for, are yet necessary to compleat the circle, all the parts of which contribute  
to the improvement of the country, &amp; some of them to it’s preservation.   the subject is now proposed for the  
consideration of Congress, because, if approved, by the time the state legislatures shall have deliberated on this  
extension of the federal trusts, &amp; the laws shall be passed, &amp; other arrangements made for their execution, the  
necessary funds will be on hand, &amp; without employment. I suppose an amendment of the constitution, by consent of the  
states, necessary; because the objects now recommended are not among those enumerated in the constitution, &amp; to which it  
permits the public monies to be applied.  
The present consideration of a National establishment for education particularly, is rendered proper by this  
circumstance also, that, if Congress, approving the proposition, shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a  
donation of lands, they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the  
necessary income. this foundation would have the advantage of being independant on War, which may suspend other  
improvements, by requiring for it’s own purposes, the resources destined for them.  
Conclusion.  
This, fellow citizens, is the state of the public interests, at the present moment, &amp; according to the  
information now possessed. but such is the situation of the nations of Europe, and such too the predicament in which we  
stand with some of them, that we cannot rely with certainty on the present aspect of our affairs. that may change from  
moment to moment, during the course of your session, or after you shall have separated. our duty is therefore to act upon  
things as they are, &amp; to make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be. were armies to be raised whenever a speck  
of war is visible in our horizon, we never should have been without them. our resources would have been exhausted on  
dangers which have never happened, instead of being reserved for what is really to take place. a steady, perhaps a  
quickened pace, in preparations for the defence of our Sea-port towns &amp; waters, an early settlement of the most exposed  
&amp; vulnerable parts of our country, a militia so organised that it’s effective portions can be called to any point in the  
Union, or Volunteers, instead of them, to serve a sufficient time, are means which may always be ready, yet never preying  
on our resources until actually called into use. they will maintain the public interests, while a more permanent force  
shall be in a course of preparation. but much will depend on the promptitude with which these means can be brought into  
activity. if war be forced upon us in spite of our long &amp; vain appeals to the justice of nations, rapid &amp; vigorous  
movements in it’s outset, will go far towards securing us in it’s course &amp; issue, &amp; towards throwing it’s burthens on  
those who render necessary the resort from reason to force.  
The result of our negociations, or such incidents in their course as may enable us to infer their probable  
issue, such further movements also, on our Western frontier as may shew whether War is to be pressed there while  
negociation is protracted elsewhere, shall be communicated to you from time to time, as they become known to me, with  
whatever other information I possess or may recieve, which may aid your deliberations on the great National interests  
committed to your charge.

e close of the present year, have  
eaingushed upwards of twenty-three millions of j  
principal.  
’Jhe duties composing the Mediterranean fund  
will cease, by law, at the end of the present • ssion.  
Considering, however, that they are levied chiefly  
ou luxuries, and that we have an impost off salt, a  
necessary of life, the free use ofwhieh otherwise is  
so important, I recommend to your cosideration the  
suppression of the duties on salt, and the continu­  
ation of the Mediterranean fund, instead there­  
of, for a short time, after which that also will be­  
come unnecessary for any purpose now within con­  
templation.  
When both of these branches of revenue shall, in  
this way, he relinquished there will still, eie long,  
be an accumulation of monies in the treasury be­  
yond the instalments of pubiick debt which we are  
permitted by contract to pay. They cannot then,  
■without a modification, assented to by the publick

debt and the couipleat liberation of our revenues,

ppace continues, will they he wanting for any other  
existing purpose. The question, therefore, now  
comes forward, to what other objects shall these  
surplusses he appropriated, and the whole surplus  
  
ot impost alter the entire discharge of the pubiick  
debt, and during those intervals when the purposes  
of war shall not call for them ? Shall vve suppress  
the impost, and give that advantage to foreign, over  
domestick manufactures ? On a few articles of more  
general and necessary use, the suppression, in due  
season, will doubtless be right ; but the great mass  
of the articles of which the imposts is paid, are fo­  
reign luxuries purchased by those only who are rich  
enough to afford themselves the use of them. Their  
patriotism would certainly pi efer its continuance, and  
application to the great purposes of the pubiick edu­  
cation, roads, rivers, canals, and such other ob­  
jects of pubiick improvement, as it may be thought  
proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of  
federal powers. Bv these operations, new channels  
of communication will be opened between the states;  
the lines of separation will disappear, their inter­  
ests will l&gt;e identified, and their union cemented by  
new and indissoluble tics. Education is here plac­  
ed among the articles of pubiick care, not that it  
would be proposed to take us ordinary branches out  
!*&gt;nt the hands of private enterprise, which manages  
so much better ali the concerns to which it is equal;  
but a pubiick institution can alone supply those sci­  
ences, which though rarely called for, are yet ne­  
cessary to complete the circle, all the parts which  
contribute to the improvement of the country, and  
some of them to its preservation. The subject is  
now promised for the consideration of Congress, be­  
cause, if approved, by the time the state Legisla­  
tures shall have deliberated on this extension of the  
  
federal trusts, and the laws shall he pasted, find  
other arf-anginents made for their execution, the ne­  
cessary funds will he on hand, and without employ­  
ment. 1 suppose an amendment of the constitnti-,  
.on, by consent of the states, necessaryj because  
the objects now recommended are not among those  
enumerated in the constitution, and to which it per­  
mits the publick monies to be applied;  
The present consideration of a national establish­  
ment for education particularly, is rendered proper  
by this circumstance also, that, if Congress approv­  
ing&#x27;the proposition, shall yet think it more eligible  
to found it on a donation of lands, they have it now  
in their power to endow it with those which will be  
among the earliest to produce the necessary income.  
This foundation would have the advantage of being  
independent on war, which rnay suspend other im­  
provements by requiring for its own purposes the re­  
sources destined for them.  
This, fellow-citizens, is the state of the public  
interests, at the present moment, and according to  
the iniormation now possessed. But such is the  
situations o! the nations of Europe, and such too  
the predicament in which we stand with some of  
them, that we cannot rely with certainty on the  
present aspect of our affairs, that may change from  
moment to moment, during the course of your ses­

is therefore to act upon the things as they are, and  
to make a reasonable provision for whatever they  
may be. Were armies to be raised whenever a

should have been without them. Our resources  
would have been exhausted on dangers which have  
never happened, instead of being reserved for what

fcr any purpose now within contempt*,  
tkm. .¥• v-&#x27;  
  
Wfifc® both of thcicbranch#** of rove*  
nue shall, In this way, be relinquished,  
there will still, ere long, be an K«omii.  
lathm of Monies in the treasury, beyond  
the instalments of public debt which we  
are.permitted by contract to pay. They  
cannot then, without a modification,  
•••eoted to by the public creditors, be  
applied to the extinguishment of this debt  
and the complete liberation of our reve.  
tract, the moet desirable, of all objecta t  
$r*r, if our pe*ee continues, will they be  
waning for any other existing purpose.  
The question, therefore, now cornea  
forward, to what ocher objects shall these  
surpluses be appropriated, and the whole  
aurplus of impost alley the entire dls.  
charge of the public debt, mu) during  
those intervela when the purposes of war  
shall not call for them f Shgll wf sun.&#x27;  
press the impost, and give that advan­  
tage to foreign over domestic manulac­  
rare*) On a few article* of more gene­  
ral and necessary use, the suppression,  
in due season, will doubtless be rights  
but the great man of the articles oo which  
impost» paid, are foreign luxuries pur­  
chased by those only who am rkh enough  
to afford themselves the use of then.  
Their patriotism would certainly prefer  
its continuance, and application to the  
great purpose* of the public education,  
rooda, rivers canals, and such other oh.  
jecte of public improve meat, aa it. may  
ba thought proper yo add to the const it u­  
rioM enumeration of federal powers.  
By these operation*, new channel* of  
communication will be opened between  
the states j the lines of Separation will  
disappear, their interest* will be identi .  
fied, and their union cemented by  
  
ail Indissoluble ties. Education is hi re  
i placed among the irtitlu of public care,  
. not that It would be proposed to take its  
, afUnary branches out ofthe bands of pri­  
vate enterprise, which manage* lomuth  
l better all the concerns to which it is equal,  
bat a public institution can alone supply  
, those sciences, which, though rarely  
called far, are yet aeeraaary to conplett  
the circle, all the part* of which conti i­  
butc to the improvement of the country,  
and some of them to its preservation.  
The subject is now proposed for the con,  
alteration of Congress, because, if ap­  
proved, by the time the state Legislatures  
shall have deliberated on this extension  
of the federal trusts, and the laws shall  
be passed, and other arrangements made  
for their execution, the necessary funejs  
will be on hand, and without employ,  
i meat. I suppose an amendment of the  
constitution, by consent of the states,  
neoessary 5 because the objects now re­  
coil mended are not among those enumr.  
rated ia the constitutioa, and to which  
it permits the public monies to be applied.  
• The present consideration of a nation­  
al establishment for education particular,  
ly, is rendered proper by this circum.  
sugee also, that, if Congress, approving  
the proposition, shall yet think it more  
eligible to found it on a donation of lands,  
they have it now in their power to endow  
it with those which will be among the  
earliest to produce the necessary income.  
This foundation would have the advan­  
tage of being independent on war, which  
may suspend oth-r improvements by re.  
quiriag lor its own purposes the -recur  
ces destined for theitt.  
  
1 This, fellow.citires, is the state of  
i the public interests, at the present mo.  
1 Went, and according to the information  
now possessed. But such is the situs.  
| tion of the nations of Europe, and such  
too the predicament in which we stand  
with aotae of them, that we cannot roly  
with certainty on the present aspect of  
onr affairs, that may change from mo­  
ment to Moment, during the course of  
your session, or after you shall have sc.  
pc rated. Our duty is therefore to act  
upon things as they are, aod to make «  
reasonable provision for whatever they  
niay be. Were armies to be raised  
whenever n speck of war Is visible in  
our horizon, we never should have beat  
without them. »ur resources would  
have been exhausted, on dangers which  
never happened, instead of be iug reserved  
for what is really to take place. A steady,  
perhaps a quickened pace, io preparations  
for the defence ofour lea-port towns and  
waters, an early settlement of the those  
exposed ahd vulnerable parts of our cooh­  
try, a militia to organized that its effec­  
tive portions can be Called to any point in  
the union, or volunteers instead of them  
to serve a sufficient time, are means  
whichmay always be rea ly, yet never pray,  
ing on our resources until actually called  
into use. They will maintain the pub­  
lic interests, while a more permanent  
farce shall be in a course of preparation.  
But much wM depend on the prompt&#x27;,,  
tode with which these tficans can be  
brought into activity. If warbe forged  
upon us in spite of our long and vain ap­  
peals to the justice of nation!, rapid and  
vigorous movements, in hs out-set, will  
go far tow^ throwing it» burthens on

When both of these branches of  
revenue shall, irt this way, be relin­  
quished there will st ill , ere long,  
an accumulation of monies tti the  
treasury beyond the instidmejs of  
public debt which we are permitted  
by contract to pay; They cannot  
then. . without a modification, asseh  
ted to by the public creditors, be  
applied to the extinguishment of  
this debt and the com pleat liberation  
of our revenues, the most desirable  
of all objects. Nor, if our peace con  
tinues, will they be wanting for apt!  
utucr existing purpose, i tie ques­  
tion, therefore, now -omes forward,  
to -what other objects shall those sur­  
pluses be appropriated, and the  
whole surplus of impost after the  
entire discharge of the pubic debt,  
and during those intervals when the  
purposes of war shall not call or  
them ? Shall, we suppress the im­  
post, and give that advantage to  
foreign oven domestic manufactures?  
On a&quot; few articles of more general  
and necessary use, the suppression  
m oue season, will doubtless be  
right ; but the great mass of the  
articles on which impost is paid, are  
foreign luxuries, purchased by those  
only who are rich enough to afford  
themselves ihe use of them. Their  
patriotism would certainly prefer its  
continuance, and application, to the  
great purposes of t he public educa­  
tion, roads, rivers, canals, and such  
other objects of public improvement,  
as it muy be thought proper lo add  
to the constitutional enumeration oi  
federal poVeis. By these opera  
ti ns, new channels of communica­  
tion will be opened between the  
states ; the&#x27;titles of separation will  
disappear, their in4 erests will be&#x27; i  
dentuicd, and their union cemented  
by new and indissoluble ties. Edu  
cation is here placed among the ar­  
ticles of public care, not that , it  
would be proposed to take its ordin­  
ary branches out of the hand of pri­  
vate&#x27; enterprise, which manages so  
much better all the concerns to  
which it is equal; but a public in:  
j stiiuiion can alone supply those sci  
J encc!f, which though rarely called  
for, are yet neces-ary to .compJeat  
tne circle, all the parts of which  
contribute lo the. improvement of  
ihe cQuntryf and some of them to  
its preservation. T&#x27;he subject is now

yments  
and reimbursements of the funded debt, with those which have been made in  
the four years and an half preceding, will, at the close of the present year, have  
extinguished upwards of twenty-three millions of principal.  
The duties compoling the Mediterranean fund will cease, by law, at the end  
of the prefem fefion. Considering, however, that they are levied chiefly on lux­  
uries, and that we have an impost on salt, a necessary of life, the free use of which  
ocherwife is-so important, I recommend to your consideration the suppression of  
the duties cn salt, and the zentinuation of the Mediterranean fund, instead there­  
of, for a thort time, after which that also will become unnecessary for any pur­  
pefe now within contemplation. :  
  
When bothr of these branches of revenue shall, in this way, be relinquished,  
there will {till, ere long, be 2n accumulation of monies in the treasury, beyond  
the inftalments of public debt which we are permitted by contraét to pay. They  
cannot then, without a modification, assented to by the public creditors, be ap­  
plied to the extinguilliment of this debt, and the complete liberation of our rev­  
enues, the molt desirable of all objeéts. Nor, if our peace continues, will they  
be wanting for any other exilting purpose. The queltion, therefore, now comes  
forward, to what other “ohjes f(hall these furplufles be appropriated, and the  
whole surplus of impost, zfter the entire discharge of the public debt, and during  
these intervals when the purpofss of war shall not call for them ? Shall we sup­  
press the impost, and give that advantage .to foreign over domestic manufac­  
tures ? On a saw articles, of more general and neceflary use, the fuppreflion, in  
due season, will doubtless be right ; but the great mass of the articles on which  
impost is paid, are foreign luxuries, purchased by thofz only who are rich enough”  
to afford themselves the use of them.—Their patriotism would certainly prefer  
s continuance, and application to the great purposes of the public education,  
roads, rivers, canals, and such other objeéts of public improvement as it may be  
thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers. By  
these operations, new channels of communication will be opened between ‘the  
States ; the lines of {feparation will disappear, their jnterefts will be identified,  
and their union cemented by new and indissoluble ties. Lducation is here plac­  
ed among the articles of public care, not that it would be proposed to take its  
ordinary branches out of the hands of private ‘enterprize, which manages so  
much better all the concerns to which it is equal ; but a public institution can  
alone supply those {ciences, which though rarely called for, are yet neceflary to  
complete the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the  
coeuntry, and some of them to its preservation. The fubje&amp; is now proposed for  
the consideration of Congress, because, if approved, by the time the State Le­  
gislatures thall have deliberated on this extention of the federal trusts, and the  
laws fhail be pafled, and other arrangements made for their execution, the ne­  
cessary funds will be on hand, and without employment. I suppose an amend­  
ment of the constitution, by consent of the States, neceflary, because the objects  
now recommended are not among those enumerated in the constitution, and to  
which it permits the public monies to be applied.  
“T&#x27;he present consideration of a national eftablithment for education particu­  
larly, is rendercd proper by this circumstance also, that if Congress, approving .  
the proposition, shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of  
lands, they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be a­  
mong the earliest to produce the neceflary income. . This foundation would  
hzve the advantage of being independent on war, which may suspend other  
improvents by requiring for its own purposes the resources destined for them.  
This fellow-citizens, is the slate of the public.interefts, at the present moment,  
and according to the information mow pofiefled. But such isthe situation of  
the nations of Europe, and such too the predicament in which we stand with  
forme of them, that we cannot rely with certaioty on the present afpe&amp; of our af­  
fairs,shat may change from moment to moment during the course of your session,  
or after you shall have separated.” Our duty therefore is to a&amp; upon things as .  
they are, and to make areafonable provision for whatever they may be. - Were  
armiés to be raised whenever a {peck of war is visible in our horizon, we never  
fliould have been without them. Qur resources would have been exhausted on  
dangers which have never happened, inltead of being reserved for what isreally  
-#0 take place. A steady, perhaps a quickened pace, in preparations for the de-  
Fence of our iea-port towns and waters, an early settlement of the most exposed  
and vulnerable parts of our country, a militia so organized that its effe&amp;ive  
portions can be called to any point in the union, or volunteers instead of them,  
to serve a fufficient time, are means which may always be ready, yet never  
pre’ying on our resources until altually called into use. They will maintain the  
public interests, while a more permanent torce shall be in a course of prepara­  
tion. But muich will depend on the promptitude

in the four&#x27;years and an half preceding,&#x27; will,  
at the close of the present year, have &#x27;extin­

( The duties composing the Mediterranean  
fund, will cease, by law, at the end of the  
present session. Considering however that &#x27;  
they are levied chiefly on -luxuries, and that  
we have an impost on salt, a necessary of life,  
the free u?e of which othei wise is so import­  
ant, I recommend to your consideration the  
suppression of the duties&#x27; on salt, and the  
conlin&#x27; ation of the Mediterreanean fund, in­  
stead .hereof, for a short time, after which  
that&#x27; also will become unnecessary for any  
purpose now within contemplation.  
&#x27; When boh of these branches of revenue  
shall; in this way, be relinquished, there will  
stilt, erelong, be an accumulation of monies  
in the treasury, beyond the intalments of  
public debt which we are permitted by con­  
tract to pay. - They cannot then, without a  
modification, sssemed toby the public-creditors,  
be applied to the extinguishment of this  
  
Ldebt, and the. complete liberation of our re  
  
venues, thev most desirable of all omeclst  
  
Nor, if our peace continues, will they be  
  
anting for any other existing purpose.  
The question therefore now comes forward,  
to whatoth&#x27;.-r objects shall these snqdusses  
be appropriated, and the whole surplus of  
impost, after the entire discharge of the pub­  
lic debt, and during those intervals when the  
purposes of war shall not call .for thenit!  
Shall we suppress the impost, and give that  
advantage to foreign over domestic manu­  
factures I On a few articles more gene­  
ral and necessary use, the suppression, in,  
due season, will doubtless be rielit, but the  
great mass of the articles on which impost  
is paid, are foreign luxuries purchased Ly  
those only who are rich enough to afford  
themselves the uc of them. Their patri  
  
otism wou&#x27;.d certainly prefer its continuance,

public education, roads, rivers, canals, and  
such other objrets of public improvement,  
as it may bu thought proper to add to J.he  
constitutional enumeration of federal pow­  
ers. By these operations, new channels of  
communication will be opened between the  
states; the lines of separation will disap­  
pear; their interests will be identified, and  
their union cemented by knew and indisot.  
bit ties -Education is. here placed among  
the articles of public care, not that it would

debt, and the complete liberation of our re-  
venues, the most desirable of all objects.  
Nor, if our peace continues, will they be  
wauting for any other existing purpose. The  
question, therefore, now comes forward, to  
what other object shall these surplusses be  
appropriated, and the whole surplus of im-  
post, after the entire discharge of the public  
debt, and during these intervals when the  
purposes of war shall not call for them ? Shall  
we suppress the impost, and give that advan-  
tage to foreign over domestic manufactures ?  
On a few articles of more general and ne-  
cessary use, the suppression, in due season,  
will doubtless be right; but the great mess  
of the articles on which impost is paid, are  
foreign luxuries, purchased by those only  
who are rich enough to afford themselves the  
use of them. ‘Their patriotism would cer-  
tainly prefer its continuance, and application  
to the great purposes of the public education,  
roads, rivers, canals, and such other objects  
of public improvement, as it may be thought  
proper to add to the constitutiona] enumera-  
tron of federal po-vers. By these operations  
netv channels of communication will be  
opened between the states; the lines of se-  
paration will disappear, their interests will  
be identified, and their union cemented by  
new and indissoluble ties. Education is  
here placed among the articles of public care,  
not that it would be proposed to take its or-  
dinary branches out of the hands of private  
eaterprise, which manages so much better

all the concerns to which it is equsl: but a  
public institntion can alone supply those  
sciences, which, though rarely called for,  
are yet necessary to complete the circle, all  
the parts of which contribute to the improve-  
ment of the country, and some of them to  
its preservation. The subject is now pro-  
posed for the consideration of Congress, be-  
cause, if approved, by the time the state of  
legislatures shall have deliberated on this  
extension of the federal trusts, and the laws  
shall. have passed, and other arrangements  
made for their execution, the necessary funds  
will be on hand, and without employment.  
I suppose an amendment of the constitution,  
by consent of the states, necessary: because  
the objects now recommended are not  
among those enumerated in the constitution,  
and to which it permits the public monies to  
be applied.—The present consideration of a  
national establishment for education, parti-  
culatly, is rendered proper by this cireum-  
stance also, that if Congress, appreving the  
proposition, shall yet think it more eligible  
to found it on a donation of lands, they have  
it now ia their power to endow it with those  
  
. which will be among the earliest to produce  
  
the necessary income. ‘This foundation  
would have the advantage of being indepen-  
dent on war, which may suspend other  
improvements, by requiring for ifs own  
purposes, the resources destined for them.—  
This, fellow citizens, is the state of the pub.  
lic interests at the present moment, and ac-  
cording to the information now possessed,  
But such is the situation of the nations of  
Europe, and such, too, the predicament in  
which we stand with some of them, that we  
cannot rely, with certainty on the present  
aspect of our affairs, that they may change  
from moment to moment, during the course  
of your session, or after you shal] have sepa-  
rated. Our duty is, therefore, to act upon  
the things as they are, and to make a reason-  
able provision for whatever they may be.  
Were armies to be raised whenever a speck  
of war is visible in our horizon, we never  
should have been without them. Onr re-  
sources would‘have been exhausted on dan-  
gers which have never happened, instead of  
being reserved for what is really to take  
place. Avsteady, perbapsa quickened pace  
in preparations for the defence of our sea  
port towns and waters, an early settlement  
of the most exposed and vulnerable parts of  
the country, a militia so organized, that its  
effective portions can be ca&#x27;led to any point  
in the Union, or volunteers instead o dhe,  
to serve a sufficient time, are means which  
may always be deer 6 yet never preying upon

America.— Message of the President of the  
Senate and House of Representatives of  
the United States of America, in Congress  
assemlled, Decemler 2, 1806.  
  
It would have given me, fellow-citizens,  
great satisfaction to announce, in the mo-  
ment of your meeting, that the difficulties  
in our foreign relations, existing at the time  
of our last separation, had been amicably  
and justly terminated. I Jost no time in  
taking those measures which were most  
likely to bring them to sach a termination,  
by special missions, charged with such pow-  
ers and instructions, as, in the event of  
failare, could leave no imputation on either  
our moderation or forbearance. The delays,  
which have since taken place in our nego-  
liations with the British government, ap-  
pear to have proceeded from causes which  
do not forbid the expectation that, during  
the course of the session, I may be enabled  
to lay before you their final issue.—What  
will be that of the negotiations for settling  
our differences: with Spain, nothing which  
had taken place, at the date of the last dis-  
patches, enables us to pronounce, On the  
western side of the Mississippi, she advanced  
in considerable force, and took post at the  
seitlement of Bayon’ Pierre, on the Red  
River.—This Village was originally seitied  
by France, was held by her as long as she  
held Louisiana, and was delivered to Spain  
only asa part of Louisiana. Being small,  
insulated, and distant, it was not observed,  
at the moment of re-delivery to France and  
the United States, that she continued a  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
guard of half a dozen men, which had been  
  
stationed there. A proposition, however,

for any purpose now within contemplation.  
—When both of these branches of revenue  
shall, in this way, be relinquished, there will  
still, ere long, be an accumulation of monies  
jn the Treasury, beyond the instalment of  
public debt, which we are permitted by con-  
tract to pay. They cannot, then, with-  
out a modification assented to by the public  
creditors, be applied to the extinguishment  
of this debt, and complete liberation of our  
revenues, the most desirable of all objects.  
Nor, if our peace continues, will they be  
wanting for any other existing purpose.—  
The question, therefore, now comes forward,  
to what other object shall those surplusses  
be appropriated, and the whole surplus of  
impost, after the entire discharge of the  
pudlic debt, and during those intervals when  
the purposes of war shal] not call for them ?  
Shall we suppress the impost, and give that  
advantage to foreign over domestic manufac-  
tures? On a few articles of more general  
and necessary use, the supression, in due  
season, will doubtless be right; but the  
great mass of the articles on which impost is  
paid, are foreign luxuries, purchsed by those  
only who are rich enough to afford  
themselves the use of them —Their patroit-  
ism would certainly prefer its conti-  
muance, end application to the great pur-  
poses of the public education, roads, rivers,  
canals, and such other objects of public im-  
provement, as it may be thought proper to  
add to the constitutional enumeration of fe-  
deral powers. By these operations, new  
channels of communication will be opened  
between-the States ; the | nes of separation  
will disappear, their interests will be identi-  
fied, and their anion cemented by new and  
indissoluble ties. Education is here p!aced  
among the articles of public care, pot that  
it would be proposed to take its ordinary  
branches out of the hands of private enter-  
prise, which manages so much better all  
the concerns to which it is equal: but a  
public institution can alone supply those  
sciences, which, though rarely called for,  
are yet necessary to complete the circle, all  
the parts of which contribute to the im-  
provement of the country, and some of  
them to its preservation.—The subject is  
now proposed for the consideration of Con-  
  
ess, because, if approved, by the time the  
  
ate Legislatures shall have deliberated on  
‘this extension of the federal trusts, and the  
laws shall have passed, and other arrange-  
ments made for their executicn, the neces-

the comstitation, by consent of the Siates,  
  
  
  
our negotiation, or such incidents in thet  
  
  
  
necessary ; because the objects now recom.  
mended are not among those enumerated jy  
the constitution, and to which it permits  
the public monies to be applicd.—The pre.  
sent consideration of a national establish.  
ment, for education, particularly, is ren.  
dered proper by this circumstance ; also, that  
it Congress, approving the proposition, shal]  
yet think it~more eligible to found it on a  
donation of lands, they have it now in  
their power to endow it with those which  
will be among the earliest to produce  
the necessary income. This. foundation  
would have the acvantage of being inde-  
pendent on war, which may suspend other  
improvements by requiring for its own  
purposes, the resources destined for that.—  
This fellow-citizens, i: the state of the  
public interests, at the present moment,  
and according to the information now posess-  
ed.—But such is the situation of the nations  
of Europe, and such, too, the pridicament  
in which we stand with some of them, that  
we cannot rely, with certainty, ‘on the  
present aspect of our affairs, that may  
change from moment to moment, during the  
course of your Session, or after you shall  
have separated. Our duty is, therefore, to  
act upon the things as they are, and to  
make a reasonable provision for whatever  
they may be. Were armies to be raised  
whenever a speck of war is visible in our  
horizon, we never should have been without  
them.. Our resources would have been ex-  
hausted on dangers which have never hap-  
pened, instead of being reserved for what  
is really to. take place. A steady, perhaps  
a quickened pace in preparations for the  
defence of our sea-port towns and waters,  
an early settlement of the most exposed  
and vulnerable parts of the country, a mi-  
litia so organised, that its affective portions  
can be called to any point in the Union, or  
volunteers instead of them, to serve a suffi-  
cient time, are means which may aiways  
be ready, yet never preying upon our re-  
sources, until actually called into use.  
They will maintain the public interests,  
while a more permanent force shall bein a  
course of preparation, But much will  
depend on’ the promptitude with which  
those means can be brought into activity.  
if war be forced upon us, in spite of out  
long and vain, appeals to the justice of 0a-  
tions, rapid and vigorous movements 10 1&#x27;§

course and issue, and towards throwing 1s

they may be. Were armies to be raised whenever a  
speck of war is visible in our horizon, we never should  
have been without them. Our resources would have  
been exhausted on dangers which have never hap-

take place. A steady, perhaps a quickened, pace in  
preparations for the defence of our seaport towns

and vulnerable parts of our country; a militia so  
organized that its effective portions can be called to  
any point in the Union, or volunteers instead of them  
to serve a sufficient time, are means which may  
always be ready, yet never be preying on our resources  
until actually called into use. They will maintain

and the improvement of water-courses generally,  
and without limitation. This is my argument,  
and the whole of my argument. Mr. Jetferson, in  
his annual message at the opening of the second  
session of the Ninth Congress, held this lancuage  
on the subject:  
  
«The question, therefore, now comes forward, To what  
other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated, and the  
whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the  
publie debt, and during those intervals when the purposes  
of war shall not call for them? Shall we suppress the im-  
post, and give that advantage to foreign over domestic man-  
ufactures?) Ona few articles of more gencral and neces-  
sary use, the suppression, in due season, will doubtless be  
right; but the great mass of the articleson wh@ch impost is  
paid are foreign luxuries, purchased by those only who are  
rich enough to afford themselves the use of them. Their  
patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and appli-  
cation to the great purposes of the public education, roads,  
rivers, canals, aud such other objects of public improvement  
as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional  
enumeration of Federal powers. By these operations, new  
channels of communication will be opened between the  
States ; the lines of separation will disappear; their inter  
  
ests will be identified, and their union cemented by new |  
  
and indissoluble ties. Education is here placed among the  
articles of public care; not that it would be proposed to  
take its ordinary branches out of the hands of private en-  
  
terprise, which manages so much better all the concerns to |  
  
which it is equal ; but a public institution can alone supply  
those branches which, though rarely called for, are yet ne-  
eessary to complete the circle, all the parts of which con-  
tribute to the improvement of the country, and some of them  
to its preservation. ‘The subject is now proposed for the  
consideration of Congress, because, if approved by the time  
the State Legislatures shall have deliberated on this exten-  
sion of the Federal trusts, and the laws shall be passed, and  
other arrangements made for their execution, the necessary  
funds will be on hand and withoutemployment. I suppose  
an amendment to the Constitution, by consent of the States,  
necessary, because the objects now recommended are not  
among those enumerated in the Constitution, and to which  
it permits the public moneys to be applied.”’

By these operations new channels of communication will be opened  
between the States, the lines of separation will disappear, their in-  
terests will be identified, and their union cemented by new and in-  
dissoluble ties. Edutation is here placed among the articles of  
public care; not that it would be proposed to take its ordinary  
branches out of the hands of private enterprise, which manages so  
much better all the concerns to which it is equal ;- but a public in-  
stitution can alone supply those sciences which, though rarely  
called for, are yet necessary to complete the circle, all the parts  
of which contribute to the improvement of the country, and some  
of them to its preservation.  
  
“The subject is now proposed for the consideration of Con-  
gress, because, if approved, by the time the State Legislatures  
shall have deliberated on this extension of the federal trusts, and  
the laws shall be passed and other arrangeménts made for their  
execution, the necessary funds will be on hand and without em-  
ployment. I suppose an amendment to the Constitution, by con-  
sent of the States, necessary, because the objects now recom-

Both relief from taxation and the means of defence might be sufficiently  
obtained without exhausting their resources, and still the great interests of

commensurate with the magnitude of the country; ‘ by these operations new  
channels of communication will be opened between the States, the lines of  
separation will disappear, their interests will be identified, and their union
