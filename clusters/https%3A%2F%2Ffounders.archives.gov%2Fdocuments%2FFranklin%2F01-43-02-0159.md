 cultivators of the earth, artizans manufacturers &amp; fishermen unarmed, &amp; inhabiting unfortified towns, villages or places, whose occupations are for the common subsistence &amp; benefit of mankind, shall be allowed to continue their respective employments, and shall not be molested in their persons nor shall their houses or goods be burnt or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields wasted by the armed force of the enemy into whose power, by the events of war, they may happen to fall: but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force, the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price. And all merchant &amp; trading vessels employed in exchanging the products of different places, &amp; thereby rendering the necessaries, conveniences &amp; comforts of human life more easy to be obtained &amp; more general, shall be allowed to pass free &amp; unmolested. And neither of the contracting powers shall grant or issue any commission to any private armed vessels empowering them to take or destroy such trading vessels or interrupt such commerce.  
					24. And to prevent the destruction of prisoners of war by sending them into distant &amp; inclement countries, or by crouding them into close &amp; noxious places, the two contracting parties solemnly pledge themselves to each other &amp; to the world that they will not adopt any such practice; that neither will send the prisoners whom they may take from the other into the East-Indies or any other parts of Asia or Africa; but that they shall be placed in some part of their dominions in Europe or America, in wholesome situations, that they shall not be confined in dungeons, prisonships, or prisons, nor be put into irons, nor bound, nor otherwise restrained in the use of their limbs,  
  
that the officers shall be enlarged on their paroles within convenient districts &amp; have comfortable quarters, &amp; the common men be disposed in cantonments open &amp; extensive enough for air &amp; exercise, &amp; lodged in barracks as roomly &amp; good as are provided by the party in whose power they are for their own troops, that the officers shall also be daily furnished by the party in whose power they are with as many rations &amp; of the same articles &amp; quality as are allowed by them, either in kind or by commutation, to officers of equal rank in their own Army, and all others shall be daily furnished by them with such ration as they allow to a common soldier in their own service; the value whereof shall be paid by the other party on a mutual adjusment of accounts for the subsistence of prisoners at the close of the war: and the said accounts shall not be mingled with, or set off against any others, nor the ballances due on them be witheld as a satisfaction or reprisal for any other article, or for any other cause real or pretended whatever: that each party shall be allowed to keep a commissary of prisoners of their own appointment with every seperate cantonment of prisoners in possession on the other, which commissary shall see the prisoners as often as he pleases, shall be allowed to receive &amp; distribute whatever necessaries may be sent to them by their friends, &amp; shall be free to make his reports in open letters to those who employ him. But if any officer shall break his parole, or any other prisoner shall escape from the limits of his cantonment, after they shall have been disignated to him, such individual officer or other prisoner shall forfeit so much of the benefit of this article as provides for his enlargement on parole or cantonment. And it is declared that neither the pretence that war dissolves all treaties, nor any other whatever shall be considered as annulling or suspending this &amp; the next preceding article, but on the contrary that the state of war is precisely that for which they are provided, and during which they are to be as sacredly observed as the most acknowled articles in the law of nature &amp; nations

should not be molested by enemies even

neither of the cOntracting parties should  
issue any commission to any private  
armed vessel against the other, empower-  
ing them to take or destroy its trading  
vessels, or to interrupt commerce. But  
this treaty expired in 1799, and the  
privateering clause was not renewed.
