I transmit for the information of Congress, copies of a letter from the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to the Secretary of State, with the answer of the latter.  
In appreciating the accepted proposal of the Government of Great Britain for instituting negociations for peace, Congress will not fail to keep in mind, that vigorous preparations for carrying on the war, can in no respect impede the progress to a favorable result; whilst a relaxation of such preparations, should the wishes of the United States for a speedy restoration of the blessings of peace be disappointed, would necessarily have the most injurious consequences.

In appreciating the accepted proposal of  
the Government of Great Britain, for insti.  
tutiug negotiations for peace, Congress will  
not fail I o keep in mind, that vigorous pre.  
parations for carrying on the war can in no  
respect impede the progress to a favourable  
result, whilst a relaxation of such prepara­  
tions, should the wishes of the United States  
for a speedy restoration of the blessings of  
peace be disappointed, would necessarily  
have the most injurious consequences.
