them of their fare? As I hate deception,  
even where the imagination only is con­  
cerned, I will. It is needless to premise

terday. To say how it is usually covered,  
is rather more essential, and this shall be  
the purport of my letter. Since our arri­  
val at this happy spot, we have bad a ham  
Csometimes a shoulder) of bacon to grace  
the head of the table, a piece of roast beef  
adorns the foot, and a small dish of greens  
or beans (almost imperceptible) decorates  
the centre. When the cook has a mind to  
cut a figure, (and this, I presume, he will  
attempt to-morrow,) we have two beefsteak  
pies, or dishes of crabs in addition, one on  
each side of the centre dish dividing the  
space, and reducing the distance between  
dish and dish to six feet, which without  
them would be nearly twelve feet. Of late,  
he has had the surprising luck to discover  
that apples will make pies, and it is a ques­  
tion, if, amidst the violence of his efforts,  
we don&#x27;t get one of apples, instead of both  
of beef. If the ladies can put up with such  
entertainment, and submit to partake of it  
on plates once tin, but now iron, (not be­

see them. I am, dear Doctor,

Dear Doctor. I have asked Mrs.  
Cochrane and Mrs. Livingstone to dine  
with me to-morrow, but I am not in  
honor bound to apprise them of their  
fare. As I hate deception, even where  
the imagination only is concerned, I  
will. It is needless to promise that my  
table is large enough to hold the la­  
dies; of this they had ocular proof  
yesterday. To say how it is covered  
is rather more essential, and this shall  
be the purport of my letter.  
Since our arrival at this happy spot  
we have had a ham, sometimes a  
shoulder of bacon, to grace the head  
of tjsp table; a piece of roast beef  
adorns the foot and a dish of beans or  
greens almost imperceptibly decorates  
the centre.  
When the cook has a mind to cut  
a figure, which I presume will be the  
uuie win u  
have tWO beef-  
case to-morrow, we  
steak pies or a dish of crabs in addi­  
tion, one on each side of centre dish,  
dividing the space, reducing the dis  
tance between dishes about bix reet,  
which without them would be nearly  
twelve feet apart.  
Of late he has had the surprising  
sagacity to discover that apples will  
make pies, and it is a question if, in  
the violence of his efforts, we do not  
get one of apple instead of both of  
beefsteaks.  
If the ladies can put up with such  
entertainment, and will submit to par­  
take of it on plates, once tin, but now  
iron (not become so by the labor of  
scouring), I shall be happy to see  
them, and am, dear doctor

honor bound to apprise them of their  
fare. As I hate deception, even where  
the ibaginafion only Is concerned, I  
will. It is needless to promise that my  
table is large enough to hold the ladies;  
of this they had ocular proof yester­  
day. To say how it is covered is rather  
mbre essential, and this shall be the  
purport of my letter.  
-Since our arrival at this happy spot  
we have had a ham, sometimes a shoul­  
der of bacon, tJ grace the head of the  
table; : piece of roast beef adorns the  
foot; and a dish of beans or greens al­  
most imperceptibly decorates the cen­  
ter.  
When the cook has a mind to cut a  
figure, which I presume will be the  
case tomorrow, we have two beefsteak  
pies or a dish of crabs in addition, one  
on each side of center dish, dividing  
the space, reducing the distance be­  
tween dishes about six feet, which  
without them would be nearly twelve  
feet apart.  
Of late he has had the surprising sa­  
gaolty to discover that apples will  
make pies, and it is a question if, in the  
violence of his efforts, we do not get  
one of apple, instead of both of beef­  
steaks.  
If the ladies can put up with such en­  
tgrtainment, and will submit to partake  
of it on plates, once tin, but now Iron  
(not become so by the labor of scour­  
tag), I shall be happy to see them, and  
am, dear doctor, yours
