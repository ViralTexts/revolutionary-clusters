ogressive age seems rather too indescriminatly to hint that those ⟨years⟩ full fraught with Experience, incline to Rigidity: But here we hope that his asertion which he illustrates by a Comparison has more of the Fancy of the Poet in it than the Just determination He Compares men in the vale of years, to that description of flower who in the Evening Contract their Leaves with the Western Sun. But when we See in your Excellency the utmost vigor of understanding and full possession of Strong mental Energetic Powers, we hope the Beams of Compassion will meet with as warm a Soil to operate on as in Early Manhood.  
  
[“]Two Urns by Joves high throne have ever Stood,  
the Source of Evil one, and one of Good;  
From thense the Cup of mortal man he fills,  
Blessings to these, to those distributes Ills:  
The happiest taste not Happiness Sin[c]ere,  
But find the Cordial draught is dashd with Care.  
To most, he mingles Both: the Wre[t]ch decreed  
To taste the Bad unmixd is Curst indeed.”  
  
  
Achales Speech to Priam Homer the Book 2⟨4⟩, we may venture to afirm that: a rational Being within a few days of sufering an ignominious Death for a Criminal act comes under the last Line.  
But to leave Homer Tho’ Sir these ill fated men now under Condemnation seem appropriated to be the Victims of Justice, may we not venture to apply the words of our Blessd Savior on heari[n]g a violent and Sudden Death had involved a few men. “And jesus answering Sd unto them, Suppose ye that these Gallilians were Sinners above all the Gallilians, because they Sufferd such things? Or these Eighteen men, on whom the Tower of Soloam fell, and Slew them, think ye that they were Sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you nay; But ere yet you repent; you shall all likewise Perish.[”] Luke 13 C. I mean this Sir as to the Party they Espousd But Stop my Pen, the Suplicant of this letter has no Right to preach. belongs to no Clerical order, yet tho’ of the Laity is not ashamd to own they draw from the Sacred writings such Ideas of Mercy and Compassion tho’ the Doctrine of imediate Inspiration be not included yet the perusal of the new testament has more than any other thing a Book S

“The Supream Power has in all ages paid some attention to the voice of the People, and that voice does not least deserve to be heard, when it calls out for Mercy: there is now a very general Desire that Dr Dodds life should be spard: more is not wished: And perhaps this is not too much to be granted. If you Sir have any opportunity of enforcing these reasons you may perhaps think them worthy of your Consideration But what ever you determine I must respe[c]tfuly intreat you to pardon for this intrusion your most obedient.”  
  
Samuel Johnson. 1777  
  
  
  
  
Dr Dodd himself in a Letter to the King a few Days before his Death thus writes  
  
“My Life has not been useless to mankind, I have benefited many. But my ofences aganst God are numberless, and I have had but little time for repentence; Preserve me Sir by your prerogitive of mercy from the necessity of appearing unprepared  
  
at that tribunal before which Kings, and Subjects must at last stand together; Permit me to hide my guilt in some obscure Corner of a foreign Country where I can atain Confidence to hope my prayers will be heard and they shall be poured with all the fervor of gratitude for the Life and Happiness of your majisty &amp;c. &amp;c.[”]  
all means faili[n]g &amp; Johnson wrote this to Dr Dodd  
  
  
  
June 26 77  
[“]Dear Sir  
  
that which is apointed to all men, is now come upon you. Outward Circumstances And the thoughts of men are below the notice of an immortal being who is about to Stand his tryal for Eternity before the supr[e]am judge of heaven and Earth. Of this and all other Sins you are earnestly to repent of; And may God who knoweth our name and desireth not our Death, acept your repentance for the Sake of Jesus Christ our Lord.  
  
S. John

The last Letter Ever Dr Dodd wrote was as follows to Johnson  
  
  
  
  
[“]A.M. midnight 26  
  
[“]Accept thou great and good heart my earnest and fervent Prayers for all thy benevolent and kind Eforts in my behalf Oh Dr Johnson as I sought your knowlege at an Early hour in Life would to heaven I had Cultivated the love and acquaintance of so Excellent a man! I pray God most Sin[c]erly to bless you with his highest transports the infelt Satisfaction of humane and benevolent Exertions. And admitted as I trust I Shall be before you to the realms of Bliss I shall hail your arival there with rapture and rejoice to accknowlege that you was my Counselor, my advocate and Friend, God be ever with you.[”]  
  
Dr Dodd to Dr Johnson  
  
  
  
  
M Bothwell From whom these Extracts are taken ⟨Says⟩ under this Letter was writ in Dr Johnsons own hand This unfortunate man with Piety and Compasion Suferd Death on the 27 of June 1777.  
  
And now worthy Gen. Washington I here beg your forgiveness for this long and perhaps to you Desgusting Epistle. And tho I am no Actor will conclude from a Poetical writer.

Who ever bends his holy Ear to Earth,  
  
To mark the voice of Penitence, to Catch  
Her Solemn Sighs, to tune them to his harp  
And Echo them in Harmonies divine  
Up to the Throne of Grace Ev’n Heaven is won

Christ was all in all in the great work of re-

condition ; raised the desire for deliverance  
from sin, and manifested himself to be our

It was obviously the method of Christ to speak freely, boldly,  
startlingly, and yet, with Divine discernment, to the wants of  
those about him. We must interpret him in each instance in  
the light of the circumstances and of a general concentration of  
his teachings around that instance. We must look beyond the  
words uttered to the “spirit” and the “life” of the words.  
  
To apply these remarks: we all believe that Christ did not  
understand himself as uttering full and final words on the sub-
