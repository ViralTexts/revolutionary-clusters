Washington Dec. 19. 1800.  
Mrs. Brown’s departure for Virginia enables me to write confidentially what I could not have ventured by the post at this prying season. The election of S. Carolina has in some measure decided the great contest. Tho’ as yet we do not know the actual votes of Tenissee, Kentucky &amp; Vermont yet we believe the votes to be on the whole J. 73. B. 73. A. 65. P. 64. Rhode isld. withdrew one from P. There is a possibility that Tenissee may withdraw one from B. and Burr writes that there may be one vote in Vermont for J. But I hold the latter impossible, and the former not probable; and that there will be an absolute parity between the two republican candidates. This has produced great dismay &amp; gloom on the republican gentlemen here, and equal exultation in the federalists, who openly declare they will prevent an election, and will name a President of the Senate pro tem. by what they say would only be a stretch of the constitution. The prospect of preventing this is as follows. G. N. C. T. K. V. P. &amp; N. Y. can be counted on for their vote in the H. of R. &amp; it is thought by some that Baer of Maryland &amp; Linn of N. J. will come over. Some even count on Morris of Vermont. But you must know the uncertainty of such a dependance under the operation of Caucuses and other federal engines. The month of February therefore will present us storms of a new character.
