government. the vote of your opponents is the most honorable mark by which the soundness of your conduct could be stamped. I claim the same honorable testimonial. there was but a single act of my whole administration of which that party approved. that was the proclamation on the attack of the Chesapeak. and when I found they approved of it, I confess I began strongly to apprehend I had done wrong, &amp; to exclaim with the Psalmist ‘Lord, what have I done that the wicked should praise me!’ What then does this English faction with you mean? their newspapers say, rebellion, and that they will not remain united with us unless we will permit them to govern the majority. if this be their purpose, their anti-republican spirit, it ought to be met at once. but a government like ours should be slow in believing this, should put forth it’s whole might when necessary to suppress it, &amp; promptly return to the paths of reconciliation. the extent of our country secures it, I hope, from the vindictive passions of the petty incorporations of Greece. I rather suspect that the principal office of the other seventeen states will be to moderate and restrain the local excitement of our friends with you, when they (with the aid of their brethren of the other states, if they need it) shall have brought the rebellious to their feet. they count on British aid. but what can that avail them by land? they would separate from their friends, who alone furnish employment, for their navigation, to unite with their only rival for that employment. when interdicted the harbours of their quondam brethren, they will go I suppose to ask a share in the carrying trade of their rivals, &amp; a dispensation with their navigation act. they think they will be happier in an association under the rulers of Ireland, the East &amp; West Indias, than in an independant government, where they are obliged to put up with their proportional share only in the direction of it’s affairs. but I trust that such perverseness will not be that of the honest and well meaning mass of the federalists of Massachusets; and that when the questions of separation and rebellion shall be nakedly proposed to them, the Gores &amp; the Pickerings will find themsel their levees crouded with silk-stocking gentry, but no yeomanry, an army of officers without souldiers. I hope then all will still end well: the Anglomen will consent to make peace with their bread &amp; butter, and you &amp; I shall sink to rest, without having been actors or spectators of in another civil war
