y grandaughter Ellen has undertaken to copy the Syllabus, which will therefore be inclosed. it was originally written to Dr Rush. on his death, fearing that the inquisition of the public might get hold of it, I asked the return of it from the family, which they kindly complied with. at the request of another friend, I had given him a copy. he lent it to his friend to read, who copied it, and in a few months it appeared in the theological magazine of London. happily that repository is scarcely known in this country; and the Syllabus therefore is still a secret, and in your hands I am sure it will continue so.  
					But while this Syllabus is meant to place the character of Jesus in it’s true and high light, as no imposter himself, but a great Reformer of the Hebrew code of religion, it is not to be understood that I am with him in all his doctrines. I am a Materialist; he takes the side of spiritualism: he preaches the efficacy of repentance  of towards forgiveness of sin, I require a counterpoise of good works to redeem it Etc. Etc. it is the innocence of his character, the purity &amp; sublimity of his moral precepts, the eloquence of his inculcations, the beauty of the apologues in which he conveys them, that I so much admire; sometimes indeed needing indulgence to Eastern hyperbolism. my eulogies too may be founded on a postulate which all may not be ready to grant. among the sayings &amp; discourses imputed to him by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination, correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence: and others again of so much ignorance, so much absurdity, so much untruth, charlatanism, and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same being. I separate therefore the gold from the dross; restore to him the former, &amp; leave the latter to the stupidity of some, and roguery of others of his disciples. of this band of dupes and impostors, Paul was the great Coryphaeus, and first corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus. these palpable interpolations and falsifications of his doctrines led me to try to sift them apart. I found the work obvious and easy, and that his part composed the most beautiful morsel of morality which has been given to us by man. the Syllabus is therefore of his doctrines, not all of mine. I read them as I do those of other antient and modern moralists, with a mixture of approbation and dissent.  
					I rejoice, with you, to see an encoraging spirit of internal improvement prevailing in the states. the opinion I have ever expressed of the advantages of a Western communication through the James river, I still entertain, and that the Cayuga is the most promising of the links of communication.   The history of our University you know. so far, 7 of the 10. pavilions destined for the Professors, and about 30 dormitories will be compleated this year, and 3. others, with 6. Hotels for for boarding, &amp; 70. other dormitories will be compleated the next year, and the whole be in readiness then to recieve those who are to occupy them. but means to bring these into place, and to set the machine into motion, must come from the legislature.   an opposition in the mean time has been got up. that of our alma mater William and mater Mary, is not of much weight. she must descend into the secondary rank of academies of preparation for the University. the serious enemies are the priests of the different religious sects, to whose spells on the human mind it’s improvement is ominous. their pulpits are now resounding with denunciations against the appointment of Dr Cooper whom they charge as a Monotheist in opposition to their tritheism. hostile as these sects are in every other point, to one another, they unite in maintaining their mystical theogony against those who believe there is one god only.   the Presbyterian clergy are loudest. the most intolerant of all sects, the most tyrannical, and ambitious; ready at the word of the lawgiver, if such a word could be now obtained, to put the torch to the pile, and to rekindle in this virgin hemisphere, the flames in which their oracle Calvin consumed the poor Servetus, because he could not find in his Euclid the proposition which has demonstrated that three are one, and one is three, nor subscribe to that of Calvin that magistrates have a right to exterminate all heretics to Calvinistic creed. they pant to reestablish by law that holy inquisition, which they can now only infuse into public opinion. we have most unwisely committed to the hierophants of our particular superstition, the direction of public opinion, that lord of the Universe. we have given them stated and privileged days to collect and catechise us, opportunities of delivering their oracles to the people in mass, and of moulding their minds as wax in the hollow of their hands. but, in despite of their fulminations against endeavors to enlighten the general mind, to improve the reason of the people, and encorage them in the use of it, the liberality of this state will support this institution, and give fair play to the cultivation of reason.   Can you ever find a more eligible occasion of visiting once more your native country, than that of accompanying mr Correa, and of seeing with him this beautiful and hopeful institution in ovo?  
					Altho’ I had laid down, as a law to myself, never to write, talk, or even think of politics, to know nothing of public affairs &amp; therefore had ceased to read newspapers. yet the Missouri question arroused and filled me with alarm. the old schism of federal &amp; republican, threatened nothing, because it existed in every state, and united them together by the fraternism of party. but the coincidence of a marked principle, moral &amp; political, with a geographical line, once concieved, I feared would never more be obliterated from the mind; that it would be recurring on every occasion &amp; renewing irritations, until it would kindle such mutual &amp; mortal hatred, as to render separation preferable to eternal discord. I have been among the most sanguine in believing that our Union would be of long duration. I now doubt it much, and see the event at no great distance, and the direct consequence of this question: not by the line which has been so confidently counted on. the laws of nature controul this: but by the Potomak Ohio, and Missouri, or more probably the Missisipi upwards to our Northern boundary. my only comfort &amp; confidence is that I shall not live to see this: and I envy not the present generation the glory of throwing away the fruits of their fathers sacrifices of life &amp; fortune, and of rendering desperate the experiment which was to decide ultimately whether man is capable of self government? this treason against human hope will signalize their epoch in future history, as the counterpart of the medal of their predecessors.  
					  
					You kindly enquire after my health. there is nothing in it immediately threatening, but swelled legs, which are kept down mechanically by bandages from the toe to the knee. these I have worn for 6. months. but the tendency to turgidity may proceed from debility alone. I can walk the round of my garden; not mo

pronounce it impossible that such contra-

gold from the dross; restore to him the  
former, and leave the latter to the stupi-

postors, Paul was the great Coryphaus,

Jesus, These palpable interpolations and  
falsifications of his doctrines, led me to

obvious and easy, and that his part com-  
posed the most beautiful morsel of morali-

BT ey Seitieh 10 Dr. R ~@n  
bis death, fearing that the mquisition of  
the public might getthold of it, T asked  
the return of it from the family, which  
.thcy kindly complied with. At the re­  
|quest of another friend, 1T had given him  
‘n copy. He lent it to Ais friend to read,  
who copied It, and in a few months 1t  
‘appeared in the Theologieal Magazine  
;()l’ London. Happily that repository is  
“scarcel_y known in this country ; and the  
~eyllabus, therefore, is still a seeret, and  
in your hands I am sure it will contin­  
‘ue so. ‘  
  
But while this syllabus 1§ meant to  
place the character of Jesus in its true  
and high life, as no imposter himself,  
but a great reformer of the Hebrow code  
of religion, it is not to be understood  
that I am with him in all his doctrines  
I am a Materianist; he takes the side of  
Spiritulism 3 he preaches the cfficacy of  
repentance towards forgiveness of sin; I  
require a counterpose of good works to  
redeem it, &amp;c. &amp;. It is the innocence  
of his character, the purity and sublimi­  
ty of his moral precepts, the cloquence  
of his inculeations, the beauty of the ap­  
ologues in which he conveys them, that  
I so much admire ; sometimes, indeed,  
needing indulgence to eastern hyperbo­  
lism. My eculogies, too, may be founded  
on a postulate which all may not be rea­  
dy to grant. Among the sayings and  
discourses imputed to him by his bogra­  
phers, I find many passages of fine ima­  
gination, correct morality, and of the  
most lovely bencvolence ; and others  
again, of so much ignorance, so much  
absurdity, so much untruth, charlatan­  
ism and imposture, as to pronounce Ititn­  
possible that such contradictions should  
have proceeded from the same being. I  
separate, therefore, the gold from the  
dross ; restore to him the former, and  
leave the latter to the stupidity of some,  
and roguery of others of his diseiples.  
Of this baund of dupes and impostors,  
Paul was the great Coryphmus, aud first  
corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus.—  
These palpable interpolations and falsi­  
fications of his doctrines led me to try to  
sift them apart. I found the work obvi­  
ous and easy, and that his part compos­  
ed the most beautiful morsal of morality  
which has been given to ns by man. The  
syllabus is therefore of Ais doctrine, not  
all of mine : 1 read them as I do those of  
other ancient and modern moralists, with  
a mixture of approbation and dissent.  
The history of our University you  
know so far. Seven of the ten pavilions  
destined for the Professors, and about  
thirty dormitories, will be completed this  
vear, and three others, with six hotels  
for boarding, and seventy other dormito­  
ries, will be completed the next year,  
and the whole be in readiness then to re­  
ceive those who are to occupy them.—

The old schism of federal and republican threatened nothing,  
hocause it existed in ovory State, and united them  
together by the fraternism of party. But the coincidence of  
a marked principle, moral and political, with a geographical  
line, once conceived, I feared would never more be

Jefferson&#x27;s Opinions of the Missouri Com  
  
promise, from Cotemporaneous Letters.  
On the 13th of April, 1820, he wrote to  
William Short:  
&quot;The old schism of federal and republican  
threatened nothing, because it existed in  
every State, and united them together by  
the fraternalism of party. But the coinci­  
dence of a marked principle, moral and po­  
litical, with a geographical line, once con­  
ceived, I feared would never more be oblite­  
rated from the mind; that it would be re­  
curring on every occasion, and renewing ir­  
ritations, until it would kindle such mutual  
nd mortal hatred as to render separation  
preferable to eternal discord. I have been  
among the most sanguine in believing that  
our Union would be of long duration. I  
now doubt it much, and see that event at no  
great distance, and the direct consequence  
e ooon ot ar the line which ha  
been so confidently counted on--the laws of  
nature control this--but by the Potomac,  
the Ohio, and Missouri, or more probably  
the Mississippi upwards to our northern  
boundary. My only comfort and confidence  
is, that I shall not live to see this; and I  
envy not the present generation the glory  
of throwing away the fruits of their fathers&#x27;  
sacrifices of life and fortune, and of render­  
ing desperate the experiment which was to  
decide ultimately whether man is capable of  
self-government. This treason against hu­  
man hope will signalize their epoch in future

The following explanation of the Syllabus, written by Jeffer-

another skeptical friend :  
  
“But while the Syllabus is meant to place the character  
of Jesus in its true light, as no impostor himself, but a  
great reformer of the Hebrew code of religion, it is not to  
be understood that I am with him in all his doctrines. I  
am a materialist; he takes the side of spiritualism; he  
preaches the efficacy of repentance towards forgiveness of  
pins ; I require a counterpoise of good works to redeem  
  
It is the innocence of his character, the  
purity and sublimity of his moral precepts, the eloquence of  
his inculeations, that I so much admire ; sometimes, indeed,  
needing indulgence to eastern hyperbolism. My eulogies, too,  
may be founded on a postulate which all may not be ready to  
grant. Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him, by  
his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination,  
correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and  
others, again, of so much ignorance, so much absurdity, 80  
much untruth, charlatanism and imposture, as to pronounce  
it impossible that such contradictions should have proceeded  
from the same being. I separate, therefore, the gold from the  
dross ; restore to him the former, and leave the latter to the  
stupidity of some and roguery of others of his disciples. Of  
this band of dupes and impostors, Paul was the great Cory-  
phaeus, and first corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus. These  
palpable interpolations and falsifications of his doctrines led  
me to try to sift them apart. I found the work obvious and  
easy, and that his part composed the most beautiful morsel of  
morality which has been given to us by man. The Syllabus,  
therefore, is of Acs doctrines, not all of mine. I read them as  
I do those of other ancient and modern moralists, with a  
mixture of approbation and dissent.”

others, again, of so much ignorance, so much ab-  
surdity, so much untruth, charlatanism, and im-  
posture, as to pronounce it impossible that such  
contradictions should have proceeded from the  
same being. I separate, therefore, the gold from  
the dross ; restore to him the former, and leave  
the latter to the stupidity of some and roguery  
of others of his disciples. Of this band of dupes  
and impostors, Paul was the great Corypheus,  
and first corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus.  
These palpable interpolations and falsifica-  
tions of his doctrines led me to try to sift them  
apart. I found the work obvious and easy,  
and that his part composed the most beautiful  
morsel of morality which has been given to us  
by man. The Syllabus, therefore, is of his doc-  
trines, not all of mine. I read them as I do  
those of other ancient and modern moralists,  
with a mixture of approbation and dissent.”

THOMAS JEFFERSON.  
  
He Pconounces Himself an Infidel as  
HeTErOdOK AS BOb IugERSOLI.  
A question has been raised of late as to  
Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s religious views. There need  
be no question, for he has settled it himself. He was  
an Infidel, or, as he chose to termed it, a Materialist.  
By his own account he was as heterodox as Colonel  
Ingersoll is, and in some respects even more so. In  
&quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Works,&quot; vol iv. page 320, will be found  
a letter, which he wrote to William short in 1820,  
and from which the following is an extract:  
But while this syllabus is meant to place the char.­  
acter of Jesus in its true light, as no impostor himself,  
but as a great reformer of the Hebrew code of religion,  
it is not to be understood that I am with Him in all  
His doctrines. I am a Materialist; He takes the side  
of Spiritualism. He preaches the efficacy of repent­  
ance toward forgiveness of sin; I require a counter­  
poise of good works to redeem it, &amp;c. Among the say­  
ings and discourses imputed to Him by His biographies  
I find many passages of fine imagination, correct  
morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and  
others, again, of so much ignorance, so much absurdity.  
so much untruth, charlatanism, and imposture as to  
pronounce it imposible that such contradictions  
should have proceeded from the same being. I sepa­  
rate, therefore, the gold from the dross, restore to  
Him the former, and leave the latter to the stupidity  
of some and the roguery of others of His disciples

I have been among the most sanguine in be-  
lieving that our Union would be of long durs­  
tion. I now doubt it much, and see the event  
at no great distance, and the direct consequence  
of this question, not by the line which has been  
so confidently counted on-the laws of nature  
control this--but by the Potomac, Ohio and Mis­  
souri, or more probably the Mississippi upward  
to our northern boundary. My only comfort  
and confidence is that I shall not live to see  
this; and I envy not the present generation the  
glory of throwing away the fruits of their fa­  
thers&#x27; sacrifice of life and fortune, and of ren­  
dering desperate the experiment which was to  
decide ultimately whether man is capable of  
self-Government.
