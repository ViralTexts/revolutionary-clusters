]  
Resuming the subject of the last paper I proceed to enquire whether the federal government or the state governments will have the advantage with regard to the predilection and support of the people. Notwithstanding the different modes in which they are appointed, we must consider both of them, as substantially dependent on the great body of the citizens of the United States. I assume this position here as it respects the first, reserving the proofs for another place. The federal and state governments are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people, instituted with different powers, and designated for different purposes. The adversaries of the constitution seem to have lost sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on this subject; and to have viewed these different establishments, not only as mutual rivals and enemies, but as uncontrouled by any common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each other. These gentlemen must here be reminded of their error. They must be told that the ultimate authority, wherever the derivative may be found, resides in the people alone; and that it will not depend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the different governments, whether either, or which of them, will be able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expence of the other. Truth no less than decency requires, that the event in every case should be supposed to depend on the sentiments and sanction of their common constituents.  
Many considerations, besides those suggested on a former occasion, seem to place it beyond dou

he state governments could have little to apprehend, because it is only within a certain sphere, that the federal power can, in the nature of things, be advantageously administered.  
The remaining points on which I proposed to compare the federal and state governments, are the disposition, and the faculty they may respectively possess, to resist and frustrate the measures of each other.  
It has been already proved, that the members of the federal will be more dependent on the members of the state governments, than the latter will be on the former. It has appeared also, that the prepossessions of the people on whom both will depend, will be more on the side of the state governments, than of the federal government. So far as the disposition of each, towards the other, may be influenced by these causes, the state governments must clearly have the advantage. But in a distinct and very important point of view, the advantage will lie on the same side. The prepossessions which the members themselves will carry into the federal government, will generally be favorable to the states; whilst it will rarely happen, that the members of the state governments will carry into the public councils, a bias in favor of the general government. A local spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of the congress, than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures of the particular states. Every one knows that a great proportion of the errors committed by the state legislatures proceeds from the disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and permanent interests of the state, to the particular and separate views of the counties or districts in which they reside. And if they do not sufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the collective welfare of their particular state, how can it be imagined, that they will make the aggregate prosperity of the union, and the dignity and respectability of its government, the objects of their affections and consultations? For the same reason, that the members of the state legislatures will be unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects, the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach themselves too much to local objects. The states will be to the latter, what counties and towns are to the former. Measures will too often be decided according to their probable effect, not on the national prosperity and happiness, but on the prejudices, interests and pursuits of the governments and people of the individual states. What is the spirit that has in general characterized the proceedings of congress? A perusal of their journals as well as the candid acknowledgments of such as have had a seat in that assembly, will inform us, that the members have but too frequently displayed the character, rather of partizans of their respective states, than of impartial guardians of a common interest; that where, on one occasion, improper sacrifices have been made of local considerations to the aggrandizement of the federal government; the great interests of the nation have suffered on an hundred, from an undue attention to the local prejudices, interests and views of the particular states. I mean not by these reflections to insinuate, that the new federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of policy than the existing government may have pursued, much less that its views will be as confined as those of the state legislatures; but only that it will partake sufficiently of the spirit of both, to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual states, or the prerogatives of their governments. The motives on the part of the state governments, to augment their prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government, will be over-ruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members.  
Were it admitted however that the federal government may feel an equal disposition with the state governments to extend its power beyond the due limits, the latter would still have the advantage in the means of defeating such encroachments. If an act of a particular state, though unfriendly to the national government, be generally popular in that state, and should not too grossly violate the oaths of the state officers, it is executed immediately, and of course, by means on the spot, and depending on the state alone. The opposition of the federal government, or the interposition of federal officers, would but inflame the zeal of all parties on the side of the state, and the evil could not be prevented or repaired, if at all, without the employment of means which must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty. On the other hand, should an unwarrantable measure of the federal government be unpopular in particular states, which would seldom fail to be the case, or even a warrantable measure be so, which may sometimes be the case, the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand. The disquietude of the people, their repugnance and perhaps refusal to co-operate with the officers of the union, the frowns of the executive magistracy of the state, the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose in any state difficulties not to be despised; would form in a large state very serious impediments, and where the sentiments of several adjoining states happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.  
But ambitious encroachments of the federal government, on the authority of the state governments, would not excite the opposition of a single state or of a few states only. They would be signals of general alarm. Every government would espouse the common cause. A correspondence would be opened. Plans of resistance would be concerted. One spirit would animate and conduct the whole. The same combination in short would result from an apprehension of the federal, as was produced by the dread of a foreign yoke; and unless the projected innovations should be voluntarily renounced, the same appeal to a trial of force would be made in the one case, as was made in the other. But what degree of madness could ever drive the federal government to such an extremity? In the contest with Great-Britain, one part of the empire was employed against the other. The more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous part. The attempt was unjust and unwise; but it was not in speculation absolutely chimerical. But what would be the contest in the case we are supposing? Who would be the parties? A few representatives of the people would be opposed to the people themselves; or rather one set of representatives would be contending against thirteen sets of representatives, with the whole body of their common constituents on the side of the latter.  
The only refuge left for those who prophecy the downfall of the state governments, is the visionary supposition that the federal government may previously accumulate a military force for the projects of ambition. The reasonings contained in these papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed, if it could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger. That the people and the states should for a sufficient period of time elect an uninterrupted succession of men ready to betray both; that the traitors should throughout this period, uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the extension of the military establishment; that the governments and the people of the states should silently and patiently behold the gathering storm, and continue to supply the materials, until it should be prepared to burst on their own heads, must appear to every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious jealousy, or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal, than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism. Extravagant as the supposition is, let it however be made. Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the state governments with the people on their side would be able to repel the danger. The highest number to which, according to the best computation, a standing army can be carried in any country, does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls; or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This proportion would not yield in the United States an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the late successful resistance of this country against the British arms will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprizes of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain that with this aid alone, they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will, and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned, in spite of the legions which surround it. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession, than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors. Let us rather no longer insult them with the supposition, that they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment, by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious measures, which must precede and produce it.  
The argument under the present head may be put into a very concise form, which appears altogether conclusive. Either the mode in which the federal government is to be constructed will render it sufficiently dependent on the people, or it will not. On the first supposition, it will be restrained by that dependence from forming schemes obnoxious to their constituents. On the other supposition it will not possess the confidence of the people, and its schemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the state governments; who will be supported by the people.  
On summing up the considerations stated in this and the last paper, they seem to amount to the most convincing evidence, that the powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government, are as little formidable to those reserved to the individual states, as they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of the unio

approval of united  
action among particular States, for any purpose ; they refer  
j us. however, to a source from which we may deri\e auihori­  
tv for such union. For, says Mr. Madison, &quot;if it (this ar­  
gument) was a proper one to recommend the establishment  
of the Constitution, it must be a proper one now to assist in  
its interpretation.&quot; His mind, in adducing this argument in  
| support of the Resolutions, evidently reverts to those used by  
1 him when he advocated the establishment of the Constitu­  
tion. What were they? We quote the worJs of Mr. Madison,  
? from the XLVI number of the Federalist:  
But ambitious encroachments of the Federal Government,  
on the authority of the State Governments, would not ex­  
cite the opposition of u single State or of a few States only.  
They would be signals of general alarm. Every government  
would espouse the common cause. A correspondence would  
he opined. Plans of resistance would be concerted. One  
? spirit would animate and conduct the whole. The same com­  
bination, in s&#x27;wrt, would result from an apprehension of the  
federal, as was produced by the dread of a foreign, yoke: uml  
unltss the projected innovation should be voluntarily re­  
nounced, the same appeal to a trial of force would be made  
in tiie one case as was made in the other. But what degree  
I of madness could ever drive the Federal Government to such  
an extremity ?&quot;  
The answer to this question may be given by the present  
&#x27; Congress.  
But Mr. Madison stops not here. The language of one of  
j the Virginia resolutions is  
&quot;That this assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily de­  
clare. thai it views the powers of the Federal Govenment, as  
resulting from the compact to which the States arc parties,  
1 as limited by the plain sense auii intention of the instrument  
constituting that compact, as ;no farther valid, than they arc  
authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact;&#x27; and

That the people and the States should, for   
a sufficient period of time, elect an uninterrup­  
ted succession of men ready to betray both ;   
that the traitors should,throughout this period,   
uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed   
plan for the extension of the . military estab­

of the States should silently and patiently   
behold the gathering storm, and continue to   
supply the materials, until it should be pre­

to every one more like the incoherent dreams   
of a delirious jealousy, or the :misjudged ex­

sober apprehension of genuine patriotism.—  
Extravagant as the supposition is, let it how­  
ever be made. Let a regular army, fully equal   
to the resources of the country, be formed;   
and let it be entirely at the devotion Of the   
Federal Government ; still it would Dot be   
going too far to say, that the State govern­  
meets, with the people on their side, would be

Again, in still another number of the  
Federalist, Madison said: ‘‘ Should an  
unwarrantable measure of the Federal  
Government be unpopular in particular  
States, * * the means of opposition  
to it are powerful and at hand. The  
disquietude of the people; their repug-  
nance, and perhaps refusal to co-operate  
with the officers of the Union; the pow-  
ers of the Executive magistracy of the  
State; the embarrassments created by  
legislative devices, would oppose, in any  
State, difficulties not to be despised ;  
would form, in a large State, very se-  
rious impediments; and where the sen-  
timents of several adjoining States hap-  
pened to be in unison, would present  
obstructions which the Federal Govern-

peared to him decisive. These are succinctly  
formulated in a comparison of the Federal and  
State Governments as regards the disposition  
and the faculty they would respectively pos­  
sess to resist and frustrate the measures of  
each other. Now, in 1788 Madison was con­  
vinced, from his acquaintance with the working  
of the Articles of Confederation, that the mem­  
bers of the Federal would be more dependent  
on the members of the State Governments than  
the latter would be on the former. He felt  
equally certain for the same reason that the  
prepossessions of the people, on whom both  
would depend, would be more on the side of  
the State Governments than of the Federal  
Government. It followed in his judgment that  
so far as the disposition of each toward the  
other might be influenced by these causes, the  
State Governments must clearly have the ad­  
vantage. From a different point of view, more­  
over, he thought the advantage would lie on  
the same side, and in respect of this prevision  
Madison was justifled by the attitude usually  
maintained by Southern members of Congress,  
at all events before the civil war. He believed  
that the prepossessions which the members  
themselves would carry into the Federal Gov­  
ernment would generally be favorable to the  
States, whilst it would rarely happen  
that the members of the State Governments  
would carry into the public councils a bias  
in favor of the general Government. He goes  
on to vindicate this position from such politi­  
cal experience as the country then possessed.  
So far as that experience went, it may wel

have seemed demonstrated that &quot;a local  
spirit would infallibly prevail much more in  
the members of Congress than a national  
spirit would prevail in the Legislatures of the  
particular States. Every one knows that a  
great proportion of the errors committed by  
the State frexislaturee prooucdsificorthd coo  
of the members to sacrifice the com­  
prehensive and permanent interest of the State  
to the particular and separate views of the  
counties or districts in which they reside.  
And if they do not sufficiently enlarge  
their policy to embrace the collective wel­  
fare of their particular State, how can it  
he imagined that they will make the aggregate  
prosperity of the Union, and the dignity and  
respectability of its Government the objects of  
their affections and consultations? For the  
same reason that the members of the State  
Legislatures will be unlikely to attach them­  
selves sufficiently to national objects, the mem­  
bers of the Federal Legislature will be likely  
to attach themselves too much to local objects.  
A river and harbor bill, for instance.! The  
States will be to the latter what counties and  
towns are to the former. Measures will too  
often be decided las in the case of adjustments  
of the tariffl according to their probable effect,  
not on the national prosperity and happiness,  
but on the prejudices, interests, and pursuits  
of the Governments and people of the indi­  
vidual States.&quot;  
This was a perfectly reasonable expectation  
to base on the data furnished by the old Articles  
of Confederation. Indeed, the operation of the  
Constitution itself has furnished warrant for

example, &quot;is the spirit that has in general  
characterized the proceedings of Congress? A  
perusal of their journals, as well as the eandid  
acknowledgments of such as have had a seat  
in that assembly, will inform us that the mem­  
bers have but too frequently displayed the  
character rather of partisans of their respec­  
tive States than of impartial guardians of a  
common interest; that where on one occasion  
improper sacrifices have been made of local  
considerations to the aggrandizement of the  
Federal Government, the great interests of the  
nation have suffered on a hundred from an un­  
due attention to the local prejudices, interests,  
and views of the particular States. I mean  
not,&quot; concedes Madison, &quot;by these reflections  
to insinuate that the new Federal Government  
will not embrace a more eniarged plan of  
policy than the existing Government may have  
pursued; much less that its views will be as  
confined as those of the State Legislature; but  
only that it will partake sufficiently of the  
nature of both to be disinclined to invade the  
rights of the individual States or the prerogs­  
tives of their Governments. The motives on  
the part of the State Governments to augment  
their prerogatives by defalcations from the

1788. &quot;Were it admitted,&quot; he says, &quot;that the  
Federal Government may feel an equal dispo­  
sition with the State Governments to extend  
its power beyond the due limits, the latter  
would still have the advantage in the means of  
defeating such encroachments. If an act of a  
particular State, though unfriendly to the  
national Government, be generally popular  
in that State, and should not too grossly  
  
violate the oaths of the State officers,  
it is executed, immediately and of  
course, by means on the spot and de­  
pending on the State alone. he oppost­  
tion of the Federal Government, or the interpo­  
ition of Federal oficers, would but inflame  
the zeal of all parties on the side of the State,  
and the evil could not be prevented or re­  
paired, if at all, without the employment of  
means which must always be resorted to with  
reluctance and difficulty. On the other hand,  
should an unwarrantable measure of the Fed­  
eral Government be unpopular in particular  
States, which would seldom fail to be the  
case, or even a warrantable measure be so,  
which may sometimes be the case, the means  
of opposition to it are powerful and at hand.  
The disquietude of the people; their repug­  
nance and perhaps refusal to coóperate with  
the officers of the Union; the frowns of the  
executive magistracy of the State; the embar­  
rassments created by legislative devices, which  
would often be added on such occasions, would  
oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be de­  
spised; would form in a large State very se­  
rious impediments; and tohere the sentimnents of  
several adoining States happened to be in unison  
the precise case of the Southern Confederacy  
would present obstructions which the Federal  
Government would hardly be willing to en­  
eounte r. I deduction drawn by Madison at the  
close of this memorable series of papers is that  
&quot;the powers proposed to be lodged in the Fed­  
eral Government are as little formidable to  
those reserved to the individual States as they  
are indispensably necessary to accomplish the  
purposes of the Union.
