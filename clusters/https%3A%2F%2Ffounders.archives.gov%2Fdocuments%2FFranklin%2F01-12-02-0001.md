, that Wine is not a staple Commodity among them. The Truth is, they want Skill and Philosophy. Their Glebe having never been weakened by Culture, retains too rich and too oily a Rancour. Hence the Flesh of their natural Grapes is too clammy, and instead of a free fluid Liquor, emits, in the Pressing, a Juice of a ropy Consistence, like Jelly, mixed with a fibrous and pulpy coarse Substance, that floats up and down in the Liquor. And the natural Heat of those Latitudes exciting a rapid and strong Fermentation, this Excess in the Ferment is increased by the Foulness of too turbid a Must; so that before it can clarify it works itself acid.  
“As they want a Conception of the Cause of this Fault, they are sure to fall short of its Remedy. They ought to dig Vaults, and therein let down close covered fermenting Backs, deep into the Ground, where the Air would be cooled and kept temperate; In these Backs, their bruised Grapes, after treading or breaking, should lie five or six or more Days, before Pressing; during which time the Skins, fermenting and soaking together with the Must, would, by Effect of their tartarous Salt, mixing with, and rarifying the oily Tenacity of the Juice, separate the Winey Part from the Fleshy, and give Thinness and Fluidity to the Liquor, so that being afterwards pressed out in Hair Bags, and put fine into the same Backs to work, the Fermentation would stop at its due Point of Time, and the Wine be rich, lively and durable.”

 Sugar Maple great Quantities may be made. In the Frontiers of Connecticut they are now much in the Practice of it. A Friend, who has lately travelled that Way, assures me, that at Northfield, and so up to the Fort and Settlement, called No. IV. they make more than they can consume, and sell it at Eight Dollars and One Third per Hundred Weight. Some Families last Year made Five Hundred Weight.  
Extract from Mr. Anderson’s History of the Rise and Progress of Commerce, containing some curious Chronological Anecdotes.  
In the Year 1208 London’s first free Charter, for electing their own Magistrates, was obtained.  
1212 London Bridge was built of Stone.  
1234 Straw was used for the King’s Bed.  
1246 Most of the Houses of London were covered with Thatch.  
1266 Cities and Boroughs were first represented in Parliament.  
1299 Spectacles and Windmills were invented.  
  
1300 The Convenience of Chimnies was not known, but every Family sat round a Fire, in the Middle of a smoaky House. Wine was then sold only by Apothecaries, as a Cordial. The Houses were all of Wood, and it was reckoned a Kind of Luxury to ride in a two-wheel’d Cart.  
1302 The Mariner’s Compass invented, by which a Voyage could be performed in three Months, which before took up three Years.  
1340 The Parliamentary Grants to the King were then in Kind and 30,000 Sacks of Wooll was this Year’s Grant.  
1344 Gold first coined in England.  
1351 Groats and Half Groats were the largest Silver Coin.  
1357 Coals first exported from New-Castle to London.  
1391 Playing Cards invented in France for the King’s Amusement.  
1405 Great Guns first used in England, at the Siege of Berwick.  
1417 Paper, made of Linen Rags, invented.  
1505 The first Shilling coin’d in England.  
1509 No Sallads in England; Carrots, Turnips and Cabbages were imported from the Netherlands.  
1543 Pins first made in England, before which the Ladies used skewers.  
1547 Silk Stockings first worn by the French King.  
1561 Queen Elizabeth wore the first Pair of Silk Stockings in England.  
1577 Watches were first brought into England from Germany.  
Memoirs of the Culture of SILK.  
About 2500 Years before Christ, the Empress Siling began the Culture of Silk in China, where it was confined near 2000 Years, before it reached India and Persia.  
  
A.D. 555 This Silk Culture first brought into Greece, particularly Athens, Thebes, and Corinth.  
1130 Roger, King of Sicily, established it at Palermo and Calabria, by Work men brought from Athens and Corinth, at the Time of the Crusades.  
1300 The Italians received it from Sicily.  
1600 It was established in France.  
1740 Begun in America. The best Levant Silk is brought from Shirvan and the other Northern Provinces of Persia, about the Caspian Sea, the same Climate as Pennsylvania. In Italy, One Hundred Mulberry Trees, well grown, are worth £100 Sterling per Annum. That Part of the Imperial Revenue in China, paid in Silk, amounts to above 955,000 lb. Troy, and perhaps this is not the twentieth Part of the Produce of that Empire. One Million of Trees disposed into Mulberry Walks, in Pennsylvania, would in a few Years, enable a yearly Remittance to Great-Britain of a Million Sterling, and no Ways interfere with the other necessary Branches of Labour in the Community
