 And in order to prevent insults to the authority of the laws within the said harbors and waters, and thereby endangering our peace with foreign nations, be it further enacted that it shall be lawful for the President of the US. to interdict the entrance of the harbors &amp; waters under the jurisdiction of the US. to all armed vessels belonging to any foreign nation and by force to repel &amp; remove them from the same, except where they shall be forced in by distress, by the dangers of the sea, or by pursuit of an enemy, or where they shall be charged with dispatches or business from the government to which they belong to that of the US. in which cases, as also in all others where they shall be voluntarily permitted to enter, the officer commanding such vessel shall immediately report his vessel to the Collector of the district, stating the causes &amp; object of his entering the harbour or waters, shall take such position in the harbour or waters as shall be assigned to him by such collector, &amp; shall conform himself, his vessel and people to such regulations respecting health, repairs, supplies, stay, intercourse &amp; departure as shall be signified to him by the said Collector, under the authority and instructions of the President of the US. and not conforming thereto shall be compelled to depart the US.  
  
  
Foreign armed vessels refusing to depart  
  
 And be it further enacted that whensoever any armed vessel of a foreign nation, entering the harbors or waters within the jurisdiction of the US. and required to depart therefrom, shall fail so to do, it shall be lawful for the President of the US., in order to avoid unnecessary recurrence to force, to forbid all intercourse with such vessel and with every armed vessel of the same nation &amp; the people thereto belonging; to prohibit all supplies &amp; aids from being furnished them, and also to instruct the Collector of the district where such armed vessel shall be, &amp; of any or every other district of the US. to refuse permission to any vessel belonging to the same nation or it’s people, to make entry or unlade so long as the said armed vessel shall, in defiance of the public authority remain within the harbours or waters of the US. and all persons offending herein shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by fine &amp; imprisonment and shall moreover be liable to be bound to the good behavior according to law.   
  
  
Interdiction of foreign officer from the limits of the US.‘vexation’ seems too loose an expression. A.G.  
  
 And be it further enacted that whensoever any officer of an armed vessel commissioned by any foreign power shall, within the harbours or waters under the jurisdiction of the US. have offended against this act, or when any officer of a foreign armed vessel shall on the high seas or elsewhere have committed trespass on any citizen or vessel of the US. spoliation on their property, or vexation of trading vessels coming to or going from the US it shall be lawful for the President of the US. on due proof of the facts, by proclamation, to inderdict for ever the entrance of that officer within the limits or jurisdiction of the US. and if he enter thereafter, he shall be liable to be taken by Capias in the first instance, and to be punished by fine, imprisonment, and transportation to any parts beyond the seas, &amp; so as often as he shall commit the same offe

## The Following Bill, Which is Now before the House of the Representatives of the United States, Has Been Sent Us by a Correspondent at Washington. It Was Reported to the House by Mr. Nicholson, Chairman of the Gun-boat Committee, and We Are Told, Will Probably Pass the Two Houses Nearly in Its Present Form. Should It Become a Law, It Will at the Same Time, Doubtless, Become the Wonder of the Nations Who Have Hitherto Been Such Dunderheads as Never Once to Fall upon a Project so Pacifick, so Cheap, and so Simple, of Protecting Their Merchants from Spoliations and Vedations, and Their Honor and National Dignity from Insults. We Recommend to the Particular Attention and Approbation of the Democrats, Who Have Always Been so Fearful of Executive Authorigy and Influence, the Power Which This Bill Vests in the President of the United States—a Power Altogether Unknown in This Country—a Power with Which the King of England Has Never Been Intrusted
