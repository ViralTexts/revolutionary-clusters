Physical and Meteorological Observations,Conjectures and Suppositions  
The Particles of Air are kept at a Distance from each other by their mutual Repulsion.  
Every three Particles mutually and equally repelling each other, must form an equilateral Triangle.  
All the Particles of Air gravitate towards the Earth, which Gravitation compresses them, and shortens the Sides of the Triangles, otherwise their mutual Repellency would force them to greater Distances from each other.  
  
Whatever Particles of other Matter (not endued with that Repellency) are supported in Air, must adhere to the Particles of Air, and be supported by them: for in the Vacancies there is nothing they can rest on.  
Air and Water mutually attract each other. Hence Water will dissolve in Air, as Salt in Water.  
The Specific Gravity of Matter is not alter’d by dividing the Matter, tho’ the Superficies be increas’d. Sixteen leaden Bullets of an Ounce each, weigh as much in Water, as one of a Pound, whose Superficies is less.  
Therefore the Supporting of Salt in Water is not owing to its Superficies being encreas’d.  
A Lump of Salt, tho’ laid at rest at the Bottom of a Vessel of Water, will dissolve therein, and its Parts move every Way till equally diffus’d in the Water; therefore there is a mutual Attraction between Water and Salt. Every Particle of Water assumes as many of Salt as can adhere to it; when more is added, it precipitates, and will not remain suspended.  
Water in the same Manner will dissolve in Air, every Particle of Air assuming one or more Particles of Water; when too much is added, it precipitates in Rain.  
But there not being the same Contiguity between the Particles of Air as of Water, the Solution of Water in Air is not carried on without a Motion of the Air, so as to cause a fresh Accession of dry Particles.  
Part of a Fluid having more of what it dissolves, will communicate to other Parts that have less. Thus very salt Water coming in contact with fresh, communicates its Saltness till all is equal, and the sooner if there is a little Motion of the Water.  
Even Earth will dissolve or mix with Air. A Stroke of a Horse’s Hoof on the Ground in a hot dusty Road, will raise a Cloud of Dust, that shall, if there be a light Breeze, expand every way till perhaps near as big as a common House. ’Tis not by mechanical Motion communicated to the Particles of Dust by the Hoof, that they fly so far, nor by the Wind that they spread so wide; But the Air near the Ground, more heated by the hot Dust struck into it, is rarified and rises, and in rising mixes with the cooler Air, and communicates of its Dust to it, and it is at length so diffus’d as to become invisible. Quantities of Dust are thus carried up in dry Seasons: Showers wash it from the Air and bring it down again. For Water attracting it stronger, it quits the Air and adheres to the Water.  
Air suffering continual Changes in the Degrees of its Heat, from various Causes and Circumstances, and consequently Changes in its Specific Gravity, must therefore be in continual Motion.  
A small Quantity of Fire mix’d with Water, (or Degree of Heat therein) so weakens the Cohesion of its Particles, that those on the Surface easily quit it, and adhere to the Particles of Air.  
A greater Degree of Heat is required to break the Cohesion between Water and Air.  
Air moderately heated will support a greater Quantity of Water invisibly than cold Air; for its Particles being by Heat repell’d to a greater Distance from each other, thereby more easily keep the Particles of Water that are annex’d to them from running into Cohesions that would obstruct, refract, or reflect the Light.  
Hence when we breathe in warm Air, tho’ the same Quantity of Moisture may be taken up from the Lungs as when we breathe in cold Air, yet that Moisture is not so visible.  
Water being extreamly heated, i.e. to the degree of Boiling, its Particles, in quitting it, so repel each other, as to take up vastly more Space than before, and by that Repellency support themselves, expelling the Air from the Space they occupy. That Degree of Heat being lessen’d, they again mutually attract, and having no Air Particles mixed, to adhere to, by which they might be supported and kept at a Distance, they instantly fall, coalesce, and become Water again.  
The Water commonly diffus’d in our Atmosphere never receives such a Degree of Heat from the Sun, or other Cause, as Water has when boiling; it is not therefore supported by such Heat, but by adhering to Air.  
Water being dissolv’d in and adhering to Air, that Air will not readily take up Oil, because of the natural Repellency between Water and Oil.  
Hence cold Oils evaporate but slowly, the Air having generally a Quantity of dissolv’d Water.  
Oil being heated extreamly, the Air that approaches its Surface will be also heated extreamly; the Water then quitting it, it will attract and carry off Oil, which can now adhere to it. Hence the quick Evaporation of Oil heated to a great degree.  
Oil being dissolv’d in Air, the Particles to which it adheres will not take up Water.  
Hence the suffocating Nature of Air impregnated with burnt Grease, as from Snuffs of Candles and the like. A certain Quantity of Moisture should be every Moment discharg’d and taken away from the Lungs. Air that has been frequently breath’d is already overloaded, and for that Reason can take no more, so will not answer the End. Greasy Air refuses to touch it. In both cases Suffocation for want of the Discharge.  
Air will attract and support many other Substances.  
A Particle of Air loaded with adhering Water, or any other Matter, is heavier than before, and would descend.  
The Atmosphere suppos’d at rest, a loaded descending Particle must act with a Force on the Particles it passes between, or meets with, sufficient to overcome in some degree their mutual Repellency, and push them nearer to each other.  
Thus supposing the Particles A B C D and the others near them, to be at the Distance caus’d by their mutual Repellency (confin’d by their common Gravity) if A would descend to E it must pass between B and C. When it comes between B and C it will be nearer to them than before, and must either have pushed them nearer to F and G, contrary to their mutual Repellency, or pass through by a Force exceeding its Repellency with them. It then approaches D, and, to move it out of the way, must act on it with a Force sufficient to overcome its Repellency with the two next lower Particles by which it is kept in its present Situation.  
Every Particle of Air therefore will bear any Load inferior to the Force of these Repulsions.  
Hence the Support of Fogs, Mists, Clouds.  
Very warm Air, clear tho’ supporting a very great Quantity of Moisture, will grow turbid and cloudy on the Mixture of a colder Air: As foggy turbid Air will grow clear by warming.  
  
Thus the Sun shining on a Morning fog, dissipates it. Clouds are seen to waste in a Sunshiny Day.  
But Cold condenses and renders visible the Vapour. A Tankard, or Decanter, fill’d with cold Water, will condense the Moisture of warm clear Air, on its Outside, where it becomes visible as Dew, coalesces into Drops, descends in little Streams.  
The Sun heats the Air of our Atmosphere most near the Surface of the Earth; for there, besides the direct Rays, there are many Reflections. Moreover, the earth itself being heated, communicates of its heat to the neighbouring air.  
The higher regions having only the direct rays of the sun passing through them, are comparatively very cold. Hence the cold air on the tops of mountains, and snow on some of them all the year, even in the Torrid zone. Hence hail in summer.  
If the atmosphere were, all of it (both above and below) always of the same temper as to cold or heat, then the upper air would always be rarer than the lower, because the pressure on it is less; consequently lighter, and therefore would keep its place.  
But the upper air may be more condensed by cold than the lower air by pressure; the lower more expanded by heat, than the upper for want of pressure. In such case the upper air will become the heavier, the lower the lighter.  
The lower region of air being heated and expanded, heaves up, and supports for some time the colder heavier air above, and will continue to support it while the equilibrium is kept. Thus water is supported in an inverted open glass, while the equilibrium is maintained by the equal pressure upwards of the air below; but the equilibrium by any means breaking, the water descends on the heavier side, and the air rises into its place.  
The lifted heavy cold air over a heated country, becoming by any means unequally supported, or unequal in its weight, the heaviest part descends first, and the rest follows impetuously. Hence gusts after heats, and hurricanes in hot climates. Hence the air of gusts and hurricanes cold, though in hot climes and seasons; it coming from above.  
The cold air descending from above, as it penetrates our warm region full of watry particles, condenses them, renders them visible, forms a cloud thick and dark, overcasting sometimes, at once, large and extensive; sometimes, when seen at a distance, small at first, gradually increasing; the cold edge, or surface, of the cloud, condensing the vapours next it, which form smaller clouds that join it, increase its bulk, it descends with the wind and its acquired weight, draws nearer the earth, grows denser with continual additions of water, and discharges heavy showers.  
Small black clouds thus appearing in a clear sky, in hot climates, portend storms, and warn seamen to hand their sails.  
The earth turning on its axis in about twenty-four hours, the equatorial parts must move about fifteen miles in each minute. In Northern and Southern latitudes this motion is gradually less to the Poles, and there nothing.  
If there was a general calm over the face of the globe, it must be by the air’s moving in every part as fast as the earth or sea it covers.  
He that sails, or rides, has insensibly the same degree of motion as the ship or coach with which he is connected. If the ship strikes the shore, or the coach stops suddenly, the motion continuing in the man, he is thrown forward. If a man were to jump from the land into a swift sailing ship, he would be thrown backward (or towards the stern) not having at first the motion of the ship.  
He that travels, by sea or land, towards the equinoctial, gradually acquires motion; from it, loses.  
But if a man were taken up from latitude 40 (where suppose the earth’s surface to move twelve miles per minute) and immediately set down at the equinoctial, without changing the motion he had, his heels would be struck up, he would fall westward. If taken up from the equinoctial, and set down in latitude 40, he would fall eastward.  
The air under the equator, and between the tropics, being constantly heated and rarified by the sun, rises. Its place is supplied by air from Northern and Southern latitudes, which coming from parts where the earth and air had less motion, and not suddenly acquiring the quicker motion of the equatorial earth, appears an East wind blowing Westward; the earth moving from West to East, and slipping under the air.  
  
Thus, when we ride in a calm, it seems a wind against us: If we ride with the wind, and faster, even that will seem a small wind against us.  
The air rarified between the Tropics, and rising, must flow in the higher region North and South. Before it rose, it had acquired the greatest motion the earth’s rotation could give it. It retains some degree of this motion, and descending in higher latitudes, where the earth’s motion is less, will appear a Westerly wind, yet tending towards the equatorial parts, to supply the vacancy occasioned by the air of the lower regions flowing thitherwards.  
Hence our general cold winds are about North-West, our summer cold gusts the same.  
The air in sultry weather, though not cloudy, has a kind of haziness in it, which makes objects at a distance appear dull and indistinct. This haziness is occasioned by the great quantity of moisture equally diffused in that air. When, by the cold wind blowing down among it, it is condensed into clouds, and falls in rain, the air becomes purer and clearer. Hence, after gusts, distant objects appear distinct, their figures sharply terminated.  
Extream cold winds congeal the surface of the earth; by carrying off its fire. Warm winds afterwards blowing over that frozen surface, will be chilled by it. Could that frozen surface be turned under, and a warmer turned up from beneath it, those warm winds would not be chilled so much.  
The surface of the earth is also sometimes much heated by the sun; and such heated surface not being changed, heats the air that moves over it.  
Seas, lakes, and great bodies of water, agitated by the winds, continually change surfaces; the cold surface in winter is turned under, by the rolling of the waves, and a warmer turned up; in summer, the warm is turned under, and colder turned up. Hence the more equal temper of sea-water, and the air over it. Hence, in winter, winds from the sea seem warm, winds from the land cold. In summer the contrary.  
Therefore the lakes North-West of us, as they are not so much frozen, nor so apt to freeze as the earth, rather moderate than increase the coldness of our winter winds.  
  
The air over the sea being warmer, and therefore lighter in winter than the air over the frozen land, may be another cause of our general N.W. winds, which blow off to sea at right angles from our North-American coast. The warm light sea air rising, the heavy cold land air pressing into its place.  
Heavy fluids descending, frequently form eddies, or whirlpools, as is seen in a funnel, where the water acquires a circular motion, receding every way from a center, and leaving a vacancy in the middle, greatest above, and lessening downwards, like a speaking trumpet, its big end upwards.  
Air descending, or ascending, may form the same kind of eddies, or whirlings, the parts of air acquiring a circular motion, and receding from the middle of the circle by a centrifugal force, and leaving there a vacancy; if descending, greatest above, and lessening downwards; if ascending, greatest below, and lessening upwards; like a speaking trumpet standing its big end on the ground.  
When the air descends with violence in some places, it may rise with equal violence in others, and form both kinds of whirlwinds.  
The air in its whirling motion receding every way from the center or axis of the trumpet, leaves there a vacuum; which cannot be filled through the sides, the whirling air, as an arch, preventing; it must then press in at the open ends.  
The greatest pressure inwards must be at the lower end, the greatest weight of the surrounding atmosphere being there. The air entering, rises within, and carries up dust, leaves, and even heavier bodies that happen in its way, as the eddy, or whirl, passes over land.  
If it passes over water, the weight of the surrounding atmosphere forces up the water into the vacuity, part of which, by degrees, joins with the whirling air, and adding weight, and receiving accelerated motion, recedes still farther from the center or axis of the trump, as the pressure lessens; and at last, as the trump widens, is broken into small particles, and so united with air as to be supported by it, and become black clouds at the top of the trump.  
Thus these eddies may be whirlwinds at land, waterspouts at sea. A body of water so raised may be suddenly let fall, when the motion, &amp;c. has not strength to support it, or the whirling arch is broken so as to let in the air; falling in the sea, it is harmless, unless ships happen under it. But if in the progressive motion of the whirl, it has moved from the sea, over the land, and there breaks, sudden, violent, and mischievous torrents are the consequences

there are many reflexions, The higher regions having only  
the direét rays of the fun paffing through them, are compara-  
tively very cold. Hence the air on the tops of mountains, and  
fnow on fome of them all the year, even in the torrid zone.  
Hence hail in fummer. If the atmofphere were equally of the  
fame temperature, then the upper air would always be raret  
than the lower, becaufe the preffure on it is lefs 5 confequently  
lighter, and therefore would keep its place. But the upper air  
may be more condenfed by cold, than the lower by preffure :  
the lower more expanded by heat, than the upper for want of  
preflure. In fuch cafe the upper air will become the heavier,  
the lower the lighter. The lower region of air being heated  
and expanded, heaves up and fupports, for fome time, the  
colder heavier air above, and will continue to fupport it while  
the equilibrium is kept. ‘Thus water is fupported in an in-

coming by any means unequally fupported, or unequal in its

the equatorial parts muft move about 15 miles in each minute.  
In northern and fouthern latitudes this motion is gradually lefs  
to the poles, and there nothing. He that travels towards the  
equinottial, gradually acquires motion ; from it, lofes.. But if  
a man were taken up from latitude 40, and immediately fet  
down at the equinoGial, without changing the motion he had,  
his heels would be ftruck up, he would fall weftward. The

{tantly heated and rarified by the fun, rifes. Its place is fup4  
plied by air from northern and fouthern latitudes, which com-  
ing from parts where the earth and air had lefs motion, and  
not fuddenly acquiring the quicker motion of the equatorial  
earth, appears an eaft-wind blowing weftward, the earth mov-  
ing from weit to eaft, and flipping under the air.”

Hence cold oils evaporate but flow-  
ly, the air having generally a quantity  
of diffolved water.  
  
Oil being heated extremely ; the  
air that approaches its furface will be  
alfo heated extremely ; the water then  
quitting it, will attract and carry off  
oil, which can now adhere to it,  
Hence the’ quick evaporation of dil  
heated to a&quot;great degree.  
  
Oil being diffolved in air, the par-  
ticles to which it adheres will not take  
Up water.  
  
Hence the fuffocating nature of aaf  
impreghated with burnt greafe, as  
from fnuffs of candies, and the lke.  
A certain quantity of moilture fhould  
be every moment difcharged and taken  
away from the lungs. Air that has  
been frequently breathed is already  
overloaded,’ and for that reafon can  
take no more, fo will not anfwer the  
end. Greafy air refufes to touch it.  
In both cafes fuffocation for want of  
the difcharge.  
  
Air will attra and fupport many  
other fibftances.  
  
A particle of air loaded with adher-  
ing water, or any other matter, is  
heavier than before, and would defcend.

a force fufficient to overcome its re-

cles, by which it is Kept in ‘its prefent

Every particle of air, therefore, will  
bear any load inferior to the force of  
thefe repulfions.  
  
Hence the {upport of fogs, ‘milfts,  
clouds, ,  
  
Very warm air, clear, though fup-  
porting a very great guany of  
moifture, will grow turbid and clou-  
dy on the mixture of a colder air: as  
foggy turbid air will grow clear by  
warming.  
  
Thus the fun fhining on a morning  
fog, diffipates it. Clouds are {een to  
waite in.a fun fhiny day.  
  
But cold condenfes and renders vi-  
fible the vapour. A tankard or de-  
canter filled with cold wetér, will  
condenfe the moifture of warm clear  
air on its outlide, where it becames  
vifible as dew, coaleftes into drops,  
defcends in little ftreams. ~~ |  
  
The fun heats the air of ‘our ‘atmo-  
fphere molt, near the furface of the  
earth; for there, befides the’ dire&amp;  
rays, there are many reflections. More-  
over, the earth itfelf being heated,  
communicates of its heat to the neigh-  
bouring air.  
  
The higher regions having only the  
direct rays of the fun paffing through  
them, are comparatively very cold.

The lower ‘region of air being heat.

The air in fultty ‘weather, though  
not-cloudy, has a kind of hazine(s tn  
it,, which makes objects at a diltance  
appear dullandindiitin@d. This hazi-  
nefs 3s Occafioned by the great quan-  
tity of moifture equally diffuled ia  
that air. . When, by the cold wind  
blowing down among it, it is condenf-  
ed into clouds, and fils In rain, the  
aif becomes purer and clearer. Herice,  
after gufts, diftant objects appear aif. *

Extreme‘écld wits congeal the far-  
face of the earth, by carrying off its’  
fire. Warm winds sfterware!s blowin  
Over that frozen furface will‘ be chili-  
ed by it, Could that frezen furface be  
turned under, and a warmer turned  
up from beneath it, thofe warm winds  
would not he chilled fo much.  
  
The furface of the earth is alfo fome&amp;  
times mich heated by’ the fun; ‘and  
fuch heated furface not being chang-  
ed, heats the air that moves overit. »  
  
Seas, lakes, and ‘great bodies ‘of  
water, agitated by the winds, continu  
ally change furfaces ; ‘the cold furface  
in winter is turned under, by the roll-  
ing ofthe waves, and a warmer turn-  
ed up; in fammer, the warm is turms  
ed under, and colder turned up.  
Hence the more equal temper of fea-  
water, and thé air overit. Hence in  
winter, winds from the fea feem  
warm, winds from the land cold. In  
fummer the contrary.  
  
Therefore the lakes north-weft&#x27; of  
us *, as they are not fo much frozen,  
nor fo apt to freeze as the earth, ra-  
ther moderate than increafe the cold-  
nefs_of our winter winds.  
  
The air over the fea being warmer,  
and therefore lighter in winter than  
the air over the frozen land, may be  
another caule of our general north-  
winds, which blow off to fea at right  
angles from our North American  
coait ; the warm light fea air rifinig,  
the heavy cold land air prefling ‘inte  
its place.  
  
Heavy fluids defcending frequent-  
ly form eddies, -or whirlpools, as

Air defcending, or afcending, may  
form the fame kind of eddies, ‘or whirl-  
ings, the parts of air acquiring a cir-  
cular motion, and receding from the  
middle of the circle by a centrifagal  
force, and leaving there a vacancy, if  
defcending, greateltabove, and leflen-  
ing downwards; ifafcending, greateft  
below, and leffening upwards, like a  
{peaking trumpet, flanding its big end  
on the ground.  
  
When the air defcends with violence  
in fome places, it may rife with, equal  
violence in others, and form both kinds  
of whirlwinds.  
  
The air in its whirling motion re-.  
ceding every way from the centre, or  
axis, of the trumpet, leaves there a  
vacuum, which cannot be filled through  
the fides, the whirling air as aa .arch  
preventing; it mult then prefs in at  
the open ends.  
  
The greateft preffure inwards mut  
be at the lower end, the greateit weight  
of the furrounding atmolphere being  
there. The air entering rifles within,  
and carries up duft, leaves, and even  
heavier bodies thathappen in its way, as  
the eddy or whirlpool pafles over land.  
  
If it pafles over water, the weight  
of the {urrounding atmofpliere forces  
up the water ito the vacuity, part of  
which, by degrees, joins with the  
whirling air, and adding weight, and  
receiving accelerated motion, recedes  
fill farther from the céntre, or axis,  
of the trump, as the preflure leffens,  
and at lait, as the trump widens,, is

&amp;« Seas, lakes, and great bodies of water,  
agitated by the winds, continually change  
their ſurfaces, as is juſtly remarked by Dr. B.  
Franklin*; the cold furface in winter is

derate than increaſe the coldneſs of the  
winter winds in that part of America.  
The air over the ſea being warmer, and  
therefore lighter in winter than the air over  
the frozen land, may be another cauſe of the  
general north-weſt winds, which blow off to  
ſea at right angles from the North · American  
coaſt. The warm light ſea air riſing, the  
heavy cold land air preſſing into it&#x27;s place.  
  
* Heavy fluids deſcending, frequently  
form eddies, or whirlpools, as is ſeen in a  
funnel, where the water acquires a circular  
motion, receding every way from a center,  
and leaving a vacuity in the middle, greateft

ſpeaking trumpet, it&#x27;s big end upwards,  
  
Air deſcending, or aſcending, may form

8 AN ESSAY ON  
  
« When the air deſcends with violence in  
ſome places, it may riſe with equal violence  
in others, and form both kinds of whirl-  
  
winds.  
The air in it&#x27;s whirling motion receding  
every way from the center or axis of the  
trumpet, leaves there a vacuum, which can-  
not be filled through the ſides : the whirling  
air, as an arch, preventing: it muſt then  
paſs in at the open ends.  
  
The greateſt preſſure inwards muſt bs at  
the lower end, the greateſt weight of the ſur-  
rounding atmoſphere being there. The air  
entering, riſes within, and carries up duſt,  
leaves, and even heavier bodies that happen  
to be in it&#x27;s way, as the eddy, or whirl, paſſes  
over land.”  
  
“If it paſſes over water, the weight of  
the ſurrounding atmoſphere forces up the  
water into the vacuity, part of which, by  
degrees, joins with the whirling air, and  
adding weight, and receiving -acclerated mo-  
tion, recedes ſtill farther from the center or  
axis of the trump, as the preſſure leſſens;  
and at laſt, as the trump widens, is broken

as to be ſupported by it, and become black  
clouds at the top of the trump.  
  
* Thus theſe eddies may be whirlwinds at  
land, water-ſpouts at ſea. A body of water  
ſo raiſed may be ſuddenly let fall, when the  
motion, &amp;c. has not ſtrength to ſupport it,  
  
or the whirling arch is broken ſo as to let in  
the air: falling in the fea, it is harmleſs,  
unleſs ſhips happen to be under it. But if  
in the progreſſive motion of the whirl, it has

Every three particles, mutually and  
equally repelling each other, mutt  
form ao equilateral triangle.  
  
All the particles of air gravitate  
towards the earth, which graviiaiion

fides of the triangles, otherwife therr

to greater diltances from each other.  
  
Wharever parircles of other mar-  
ter (not endued with that repellency)  
are fupported in air, mult adhere to  
the particles of air, and be fupported  
by them; for in the vacancies, there.is  
nothing they can reit on.  
  
Air and water mutually attraét each

Sixteen leaden bullets, of an ounce  
each, weigh as much in water, as one  
of a pound, whofe fuperficies is lets,  
  
Therefore the fupporting of falt in  
water is not owingto us fuperficies  
being increafed.  
  
A lump of falt, though laid at reft  
at the bottom of a velfel of water, will  
diffolve therein, and its s move  
every way till equally diffufed in the  
water; therefore there is a mutual at-  
traction between water and falt, Eve-  
ry particle of water aflumes as many  
of falt as can adhere to it; when more  
is added, it precipitates, and will not  
remain hafpended.  
  
Water, in the fame manner, will  
diffolve in air, every particle of air  
affuming one or more particles of wa-  
ter ; when too much is added, it pre-  
Cipliates in rain.  
  
but there not being the fame con-  
tiguity between the parucles of air as  
of water, the folution of water in air  
is not carried on wuhout a motion of  
the air, fo as to caufe a frefh acceflion  
of dry particies.  
  
Part of a fluid, having more of  
what it diffolves, will communicate  
to other parts that have lefs. Thus,  
very falt water coming in contaét with  
freth, communicates its faltnefs, ull  
all 1s equal, and the fooner, if there  
is a little motion of the water.  
  
Even earth will diffolve, or mix  
with air, A ftroke of a horfe’s hoof  
on the ground, in a hot dully road,  
will raife a cloud of dufl, that fhall, if  
there be a light breeze, expand every  
way, till perhaps near as big as a com  
mon houfe. tt is not by mechanical  
motion, communicated to the particles  
of duft by the hoof, that they fly fo  
far, nor by the wind, that they fpread  
fo wide. But the air near the ground,  
more heated by the hor duft ftruck  
into it, is rarihied, and rifes, and, in  
rifing, mixes with the cooler air, and  
communicates of its duft to it, and is  
at length fo diffufed, as to become in-  
vilible. Quantities of duff are thus  
carried up in dry feafons. Showers  
walh u from the air, and bring: it  
down again. For water atiratting it  
ftronger, it quits the air, and adheres  
to the water.@

A greater degree of heat is requir.  
ed to break the cohefion Ae

Air, moderately heated, will fap.  
port a greater quantity of water inv.  
fibly, than cold air ; for its particles,  
being by heat repelled to a greater  
diflance from each other, thereby  
more eafily keep the particles of wa  
ter, that are uinaine them, from  
running ito cohefions that would  
obftrutt, refraét, or refleét the light,  
  
_ Hence, when we breathe-in warm,  
air, though the fame quantity of moif.  
ture may be taken up from the lungs as  
when we breathe-in cold air, yet that  
moifture is not fo vifible,  
  
Water being extremely heated, i. ¢,  
to the degree of boiling, its particies,  
in quitting it, fo regal each other,  
as to take up vafily more {pace than  
before ; and by that repellency, {up-  
port themfelves, expelling the air  
from the fpace they occupy. That  
degree of heat being leffened, they  
again mutually attract, and having no  
air particles mixed, to adhere to, by  
which they might be fupporied, and  
kept at a diftance, they inftantly fall,  
coalefce, and become water again.  
  
The water commonly diftufed  
our atmofphere never receives {uch  
a degree of heat from the fun,  
other caufe, as water has when bail  
ing; it is not, therefore, fuppored  
by fuch heat, but by adhering to air.  
  
Water being diflolved in, and at:  
hermg to air, that air will not readil  
take up oil, becaufe of the naurl  
repellency between water and oil,  
  
Hence cold oils evaporate but flor  
ly, the air having generally a quanu  
of diffolved water.  
  
Oil being heated extremely, the a

Hence the fuffocating nature of air  
impregnated with burnt greafe, as from  
{nuts of candles, andthe hike. A  
certain quanuty of moifture fhould be  
every moment difcharged and taken

In both cafes, fulfocation for want  
of the difcharge,  
  
Air will attraét and fupport many  
other fubitances.  
  
A particle of air, loaded with adher-  
ing water, Or any other matter, is hea-  
vier than before, and would defcend.  
  
The atmofphere fuppofed at reft,  
aloaded decending parucle muft att  
with aforce on the particles it pafles  
between, or meets with, fufhcient to  
overcome in fome degree ther mucu-

between B and C, it will be nearer  
to them than before, and muft either  
have pufhed them nearer to F and G,  
contrary to the mutual repellency, or  
pafs through, by a force exceeding  
us repellency with them. It then  
approaches D, and, to move it out  
of the way, muft a&amp; on it with  
aforce fufhicient to overcome its re-  
pelleacy with the two next lower par-  
ticles, by which it is kept in its pre-  
fent fituation.  
  
Every particle of air, therefore,  
will bear any load inferior to the force  
of thefe repulfions,  
  
Hence the fupport of fogs, mifts,  
and clouds.  
  
Very warm air, clear, though fup-  
porting a very great quantity of moif-  
ture, will grow turbid and cloudy  
on the mixture of a colder air—as  
fogey, turbid air will grow clear by  
warming,  
  
Thus, the fun fhining on a morn-  
ing fog, diffipates it. Clouds are feen

But cold condenfes and renders vie  
fible the vapour. A ‘ankard, or de-  
canter, filled with cola water, will  
condenfe the moifture of warm clear  
air, On its outlide, where it becomes  
vilible as dew, coalefces into drops,  
and defcends in litle ftreams.  
  
The fun heats the air of our atmo-  
fphere moft near the furface of the  
earth ; for there, befidesthe dirett rays,  
there are many reflexions. Moreo-  
ver, the earth itfelf being heated, com-  
municates of its heat to the neigh-  
bouring air.  
  
_ The higher regions having only the  
direft rays of the fun paling through  
them, are comparatively very cold.  
Hence the cold air on the tops of  
  
“mountains, and {now on fome of them  
  
all the year, even in the torrid zone.  
Hence hail in fummer,  
  
If the atmofphere were, all of it  
(both above a below) always of the  
fame temper, as to cold or heat, then  
the upper air would always be rarer  
than the lower, becaufe the preffure  
on it is lefs ; confequently lighter, and  
therefore would keep us place.  
  
But the upper air may be more con-  
denfed by cold, than the iower air by  
preaere. The lower more expanded  
  
y heat, than the upper for want of  
prefflure. In fuch cafe, the upper air  
will become the heavier, the lower  
the lighter,  
  
The lower region of air, being heat-  
ed and expanded, heaves up, and {up-  
ports, for fome time, the colder, hea-  
vier air above, and will continue to  
fupport it, while the equilibrium is  
kept. Thus, water is fupported in  
an inverted open glafs, while the equ:~  
librium is maintained by the equal  
prrfase upwards of the air below;  
  
ut the equilibrium by any means  
breaking, the water defcends on the  
heavier fide, and the air rifes into is  
place.  
  
The lifted, cold, heavy air overa  
heated country, becoming by any  
means unequally fupported, or unequal  
in its weights, the heavicft part de-  
fcends firft. and the refl follows impe-  
tuoully. Hence gufls afier heats, and  
hurricanes in hot climates. Hence  
the air of gufts and hurricanes cold,  
though in hot climes and feafons ; it  
coming from above.

tial parts muff move abour frfteen  
miles in each minute. Fn northern  
* and fouthern latitudes, this motion i3  
gradually Iefs to the poles, and there  
nothing.  
  
If there was a general calm over the

He that fails, or rides, has infenf-  
bly the fame degree of motion, asthe

Hence our general cold winds are

The air, in fultry weather, though  
not cloudy, has a kind of hazinefs in  
it, which makes objects at a diflance  
appear dull and indiitinét. This ha-  
zinefs 1s occafioned by the great quan-  
tity of moilture equaliy diffufed in

Extreme cold winds congeal the  
furface of the earch, by carrying off  
its fire. Warm mts afterwards  
blowing over that frezen furface, will  
be chilled by it. Could that frozen  
furface be turned under, and a warm-  
er turned up from beneath it, thofe  
warm winds would not be chilled fo

The furface of the earth is alfo

and fuch heated furface not being  
changed, heats the air that moves over  
it.  
  
Seas, lakes, and great bodies of wa-

ally change furtaces : the cold furface  
in winter 1s turned under by the roll-

The air in fultry weather, though  
Pot cloudy, has a kind of hazinefs in it,  
which makes objects, at a diltance, ap¬  
pear dull and indiftimit. This hazinefs  
is occafioned by the great quantity of  
moifture diftiifed in the air. When, by  
the bio wing of cold wind, the moifture  
h condenfed into clouds, or falls in rain,  
the air becomes purer and clear. Hence,  
after heavy rains, diftant objeds appear  
diftin6l, and their margins fliarply termi-  
Pated. This appearance will be forward¬  
ed by any caufe that draws off the elec¬  
trical fire which may be united with the  
mrifture.  
  
The air over the fea being warmer,  
and therefore lighter in winter than the  
air over the frozen land, may be the  
caufe of wind from a frozen continent

of the year—while in those portions of the southern hemisphere where  
there is no land, it is nearly as uniform as the trade wind.  
  
Dr. Hadley, and after him, Dr. Franklin, attributed these currents to  
the following causes: ‘The air under the equator and between the tro-  
pics, being constantly heated and rarefied by the sun, rises; its place is  
supplied by air from the higher and polar latitudes, which, coming from  
parts of the earth that had less motion, and not suddenly acquiring the  
quicker motion of the equatorial earth, becomes an east wind blowing  
westward; the earth moving from west to east and slipping under the  
air.’ M. Daniell has shown conclusively, that, from the greater densi-  
ty of the polar atmosphere than the equatorial, its height is proportion-  
ally less; so that the air rarefied between the tropics, ; and rising, must  
  
flow towards the poles. Before it rose, it had acquired the greatest mo-  
tion the earth’s rotation could give it: it retains some degree of this mo-  
tion, and descending in higher latitudes, where the earth’s motion is less,  
becomes a westerly wind.t

above, and lessening downwards, like a speaking trumpet, standing its  
big end upwards.  
  
Air descending, or ascending, may form the same kind of eddies or  
whirlings, part of the air acquiring a circular motion, and receding  
from the middle of the circle by a centrifugal force, and leaving there a  
vacancy; if descending, greatest above and lessening downwards; if  
ascending, greatest below and lessening upwards like a speaking trum-  
pet, standing its big end on the ground.  
  
When the air descends with violence in some places, it may rise with  
equal violence in others, and form both kinds of whirlwinds.  
  
The air in its whirling motion receding every way from the center or  
axis of the trumpet leaves there a vacancy which cannot be filled  
through the sides, the whirling air as an arch, preventing; it must then  
press in at the open ends.  
  
The greatest pressure inwards must be at the lower end, the greatest  
weight of the surrounding atmosphere being there. The air entering  
rises within and carries up dust, leaves, and even heavier bodies that  
happen in its way, as the eddy or whirl passes over land.  
  
If it passes over water the weight of the surrounding atmosphere  
forces up the water into the vacuity, part of which, by degrees joins  
with the whirling air, and adding weight, and receiving accelerated  
motion, recedes still farther from the center or axis of the trump, as the  
pressure lessens; and at last as the trump widens, is broken into small  
particles, and so united with air as to be supported by it, and become  
black clouds at the top of the trump.  
  
Thus these eddies may be whirlwinds on land, waterspouts at sea. A  
body of water so rapid may be suddenly let fall, when the motion, etc.,  
has not strength to support it, or the whirling arch is broken so as to  
admit the air; but if in the progressive motion of the whirl it has  
moved from the sea, overland, and then breaks, sudden, violent and  
mischievous torrents are the consequence.
