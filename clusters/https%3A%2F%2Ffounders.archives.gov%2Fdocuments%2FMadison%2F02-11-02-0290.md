to an indefinite postponement of the American claims.*  
  
As this Louisiana question has, in every stage of our negotiations  
with France, and particularly in the debate in the Chamber of  
Deputies consequent upon the late treaty, been made a principal  
obstacle to the adjustment of our pretensions, it is proper to state  
precisely what it is, and to consider how far France was justifiable  
in making its consideration the sine qua non of the discussion of  
the American claims. The eighth article of the treaty of 1803  
provides, that “in future and for ever, after the expiration of the  
twelve years,” (during which French vessels were to be placed  
on a footing with our own) “the ships of France shall be treated  
upon the footing of the most favoured nation, in the ports [of  
Louisiana] above mentioned.” ‘The alleged violation of this article  
by the United States, and the only one, consists in the admission,  
since 1815, and by virtue of the treaty of the 3d July of that year,  
of British vessels into the ports of Louisiana free of tonnage duty,  
while the ships of France pay a duty of five francs per ton, being  
the same which is levied in France upon the tonnage of the  
United States. The construction of the eighth article contended  
for by France is, that whatever privilege, in the ports of Louisiana,  
has been, since the
