ht in a report in Writing, which was read as follows:  
In Obedience to the orders of Congress, We have had a meeting with Lord Howe. It was on Wednesday last upon Staten Island, opposite to Amboy, where his Lordship received and entertained Us, with the Utmost politeness.  
His Lordship opened the Conversation by Acquainting Us, that, tho’ he could not treat with Us as a Committee of Congress, yet, as his Powers enabled him to confer and consult with any private Gentlemen of Influence in the Colonies, on the means of restoring Peace, between the two Countries, he was glad of this Opportunity of conferring with Us, on that Subject, if We thought ourselves at Liberty to enter into a Conference with him in that Character. We observed to his Lordship, that, as our Business was to hear, he might consider Us, in what Light he pleased, and communicate to Us, any propositions he might be authorised to make, for the purpose mentioned; but that We could consider Ourselves in no other Character than that, in which We were placed, by order of Congress. His Lordship then entered into a discourse of considerable Length, which contained no explicit proposition of Peace, except one, namely, That the Colonies should return to their Allegiance and Obedience to the Government of Great Britain. The rest consisted principally of Assurances, that there was an exceeding good disposition in the King and his Ministers, to make that Government easy to Us, with intimations, that, in case of our Submission, they would cause the Offensive Acts of Parliament to be revised, and the Instructions to Ministers to be reconsidered; that so, if any just causes of complaint were found in the Acts, or any Errors in Government were perceived to have crept into the Instructions, they might be amended or withdrawn.  
  
We gave it, as our Opinion to his Lordship, that a return to the domination of Great Britain, was not now to be expected. We mentioned the repeated humble petitions of the Colonies to the King and Parliament, which had been treated with Contempt, and answered only by additional Injuries; the Unexampled Patience We had shewn, under their tyrannical Government, and that it was not till the late Act of Parliament, which denounced War against Us, and put Us out of the Kings Protection, that We declared our Independence; that this declaration had been called for, by the People of the Colonies in general; that every colony had approved of it, when made, and all now considered themselves as independent States, and were settling or had settled their Governments accordingly; so that it was not in the Power of Congress to agree for them, that they should return to their former dependent State; that there was no doubt of their Inclination for peace, and their Willingness to enter into a treaty with Britain, that might be advantageous to both Countries; that, though his Lordship had at present, no power to treat with them as independent States, he might, if there was the same good disposition in Britain, much sooner obtain fresh Powers from thence, for that purpose, than powers could be obtained by Congress, from the several Colonies to consent to a Submission.  
His Lordship then saying, that he was sorry to find, that no Accommodation was like to take place, put an End to the Conference.  
Upon the whole, it did not appear to your Committee, that his Lordships commission contained any other Authority, than that expressed in the Act of Parliament, namely, that of granting Pardons, with such exceptions as the Commissioners shall think proper to make, and of declaring America or any part of it, to be in the Kings Peace, upon Submission: for as to the Power of enquiring into the State of America, which his Lordship mentioned to Us, and of conferring and consulting with any Persons the Commissioners might think proper, and representing the result of such conversation to the Ministry, who, provided the Colonies would subject themselves, might, after all, or might not at their pleasure, make any Alterations in the former Instructions to Governors, or propose in Parliament any Amendment of the Acts complained of, We apprehended any expectations from the Effects of such a Power would have been too uncertain and precarious to be relied on by America, had she still continued in her State of dependence.

f my private Letters, I afterwards found circulated in Europe, and oftener repeated than any other Part of this whole Transaction. Lord How was profuse in his Expressions of Gratitude to the State of Massachusetts, for erecting a marble Monument in Westminster Abbey to his Elder Brother Lord How who was killed in America in the last French War, saying “he esteemed that Honour to his Family, above all Things in this World. That such was his gratitude and affection to this Country, on that Account, that he felt for America, as for a Brother, and if America should fall, he should feel and lament it, like the Loss of a Brother.” Dr. Franklin, with an easy Air and a collected Countenance, a Bow, a Smile and all that Naivetee which sometimes appeared in his Conversation and is often observed in his Writings, replied “My Lord, We will do our Utmost Endeavours, to save your Lordship that mortification.” His Lordship appeared to feel this, with more Sensibility, than I could expect: but he only returned “I suppose you will endeavour to give Us employment in Europe.” To this Observation, not a Word nor a look from which he could draw any Inference, escaped any of the Committee.  
Another Circumstance, of no more importance than the former, was so much celebrated in Europe, that it has often reminded me of the Question of Phocion to his Fellow Citizen, when something he had said in Public was received by the People of Athens with a clamorous Applause, “Have I said any foolish Thing?”—When his Lordship observed to Us, that he could not confer with Us as Members of Congress, or public Characters, but only as private Persons and British Subjects, Mr. John Adams answered somewhat quickly, “Your Lordship may consider me, in what light you please; and indeed I should be willing to consider myself, for a few moments, in any Character which would be agreable to your Lordship, except that of a British Subject.” His Lordship at these Words turn’d to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Rutledge and said “Mr. Adams is a decided Character:” with so much gravity and solemnity: that I now believe it meant more, than either of my Colleagues or myself understood at the time.

Fortunately meeting Lord How at the Door I asked his Lordship, where were the Ambassadors Seats.

might be authorized to make for the  
purpofe mentioned ; but that we could  
confider ourfelves in no other charac-

placed by the order of the Congrefy.  
His Lordthip then entered into a di’-

a meeting with lord Howe, It was on Wedneſday laſt up -  
on Staten-I{land, oppaſite to Amboy, where his lord{hip  
received and entertained us with the utmoſt politeneſs.  
His lordſhip opened the converſation by acquaintin  
us, that, tho” he could not treat with us as à committee ©  
  
  
conſult with any private gentlemen of influence in the  
colonies, on the means of reſtoring peace between the two  
countries, he was glad of this opportunity of conferring,

to enter into a conference with him in that charater. We

make for the purpoſe mentioned; but, that we could con-  
ſider ourſelves in no other character than that in which we  
were placed by order of Congreſs. His lordſhip then en-  
tered into a diſcourſe of a conſiderable length, which con-  
tained no explicit propofition of peace, except one, namely  
That the colonies ſhould return to their allegiance an  
obedience to the government of Great-Britain. The reſt  
conſiſted Ae of aflurances, that there was an ex-  
ceeding good diſpoſition in the king and his miniſters ta  
make that government eaſy to us, with intimations, that,  
in caſe of our ſubmiſſion, they would cauſe the offenſive  
acts of parliament to be reviſed, and the inſtructions to  
governors to be reconſidered ; that ſo, if any juſt cauſes of  
complaint were found in the acts, or any errors in govern-  
ment were perceived to have crept into the inſtructions,  
they might be amended or withdrawn, boy  
« WE gave it as our opinion to his lordſhip, that a re-  
turn to the domination of Great-Britain was not now to be  
expected. We mentioned the repeated humble petitions of -  
the colonies to the king and parliament, which had bee!  
treated with contempt and anſwered only by additional in-  
juries ; the unexampled patience we had ſhewn under their  
tyrannical government, and that it was not till the late  
act of parliament, which denounced war againſt us, and  
— us out of the king&#x27;s 3 that we declared our  
ndependence; that this declaration had been called for by  
the people of the colonies in general; that every colon  
had approved of it, when made, and all now re  
themſelves as Independent States, and were ſettling or had  
ſettled their governments accordingly; ſo that it was not  
in the power of Congreſs to agree for them, that they  
ſhould return to their — dependent ſtate; that there  
  
  
advantageous to both countries; that, though his lordſhip  
had at preſent no power to treat with them as Independent  
States, he might, if there was the ſame good diſpeſition  
in Britain, much ſooner obtain freſh powers from thence,  
for that purpoſe, than powers could be obtained by Con-  
reſs, from the ſeveral colonies, to conſent to a ſubmiſſion,

viduals of influence. He made no expli­  
cit proposition for peace. The main point i  
?I , M? TViU&quot;,ns was&#x27; that the Colonies  
should return to their allegiance; that j  
when they had done so, the?Ki?g would  
cause the offensive | acts of Parliament to  
be revised, ,tc. If Howe designed to&#x27;  
make any personal impressions favorable !  
to his cause, he could not have been con- j  
fronted with more unpromising subjects  
than those now before him. They told  
him that a return to the old allegiance  
was oHt of the question ; that independ­  
ence was declared ; that the Colonies had  
adopted it, and that any future amity with  
Britain was to be on the footing of equali­  
ty. During the conversation his lordship  
must have seen how hopeless a thing it  
was to try and win any of the delegates.  
He alluded, with an appearance of great  
feeling, to his elder brother, killed in the  
late French war in America, and express- J  
ed his gratitude to the State of Massachu­  
seltes, which erected a monument to his  
memory in Westminster Abbey. Such  
was his gratitude, he said, that if Ameri­  
ca should fall, ?? he should feel and lament I  
  
it like the loss of a brother.&quot; This piece  
of pathos was doomed to be discomfited.  
Dr. Franklin, with an easy air, and col­  
lected countenance, a bow, a smile, and  
all that naivete which sometimes appears  
in his conversation, and is often observed  
in his writings replied, &quot;My Lord, we  
will do our utmost endeavors to save your  
lordship that mortification.&quot; Lord Howe  
felt the full force and meaning of this ; but  
he only said, &quot; I suppose you will endea­  
vor to give us employment in Europe.&quot;?  
Even in these few words implying the usu­  
al contempt for the power of the Ameri­  
cans themselves. The delegates said no­  
thing to this. When his lordship said he  
did not confer with them as members of  
Congress, or anything but private persons  
and British subjects, Adams broke into  
one of his passions, and said, &quot; Your lord­  
ship may consider me in what light you  
please, except that of a British subject.?

lows: &quot;His lordship opened the conver-­  
sation by acquainting us that, though he  
could not treat with us a committee of  
Congress, yet as his powers enabled him  
to confer and consult with any private  
gentlemen of influence in the Colonies on  
the means of restoring peace between the  
two countriss, he was glad of this oppogs­  
conferring with us on that

might consider us in what light he pleas-­  
ed. is but that we could consid  
er ourselves in no other character that  
that in which we were placed by order of  
Congress.  
&quot;His lordship then entered into a dis-­  
course at considerable length, which oon-­  
tained no explicit proposition of peace,  
except one, namely: That the Colonies  
return to their allegiance and obedience  
to the Government of Great Britain. The  
rest consisted, principally, of assurances,  
that there was an exceedingly good dis-­  
position in the King and his ministers to  
make that Government easy to us, with  
intimationg that in case of our submis-­  
sion they  would cause the offensive acts  
of Parliament to be revised, and the in  
structions to Governors to be reconsider

made, and all now considered themaelves  
as Independent States,   
that it was not in the pewer of Congress  
to agree for them that they should return  
to their dependent State; that there was  
doubt of their inclination to peace, eto  
His lordship then, saying that he was  
sorry to find that no accomodation was  
like to take place, put an end to the con  
ference.  
&quot;Upon the whole, it did not appear t

mission contained any other authority  
than that expressed in the act of Parlia

Adams replied, somewhat quickly : ‘‘ Your lordship may  
consider me in what light you please, and indeed Ishould  
be willing to consider myself for a few moments in any  
character which would be agreeable to your lordship—  
except that of British subject.” At these words, Lord  
Howe turned to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Rutledge, and said :
