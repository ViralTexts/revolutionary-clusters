 wise Conjectures about Probabilities, I shall decline all Matters of that kind.—I am glad to find that the good Sense of our Countrymen has continued you in that elevated Rank, in which they had placed you;—yet with all it’s Dignity it may sometimes prove a painful Pre-eminence.—For your Amusement I send you a Quotation from the Authors of the Rolliad and the Probationary Odes; which are justly admired for the classical Taste, Wit and Elegance, with which they are written.—In taking Notice of Mr. Cornwall, the late Speaker of the House of Commons, they quote from Virgil  
—sedet æturnumque sedebit Infelix Theseus  
“There Cornwall sits, and oh unhappy Fate!  
Must sit forever through the long Debate;  
Painful Pre-eminence! he hears, ‘tis true,  
Fox North and Burke—but hears Sir Joseph too.  
Like sad Prometheus, fasten’d to his Rock,  
In vain he looks for Pity to the Clock;  
In vain the Effects of strength’ning Porter tries,  
And nods to Bellamy for fresh Supplies;  
While, Vulture like, the dire Mahon appears,  
And, far more savage, rends his suffering Ears:—

485 divisions, consuming 120 hours, or five days, in walking through .  
the lobbies. It is probably owing to this peripatetic exercise  
that the strength of members was in some degree maintained. One  
evil, while in part aggravating, in part compensated the other. But  
it must be remembered that neither the Speaker nor the Chairman
