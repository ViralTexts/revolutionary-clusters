London, August 14, 1807.  
SIR,  
  
I had the honour to transmit  
you, with my letter of the 4th in-  
stant, a copy of a correspondence  
with Mr. Canning, relative to the  
late aggression in the case of the  
Chesapeake frigate. You will res  
ceive with this a copy of a more  
recent one on the same subject.  
  
Mr. Canning’s queries in his  
last note, I was led to consider  
as preparatory to an embargo on  
American vessels. I could not  
conceive why he should request  
information of me whether the  
president’s proclamation was au-  
thentic, and when it would be cara  
ried into effect, if it was not intend-  
ed to found some measure on  
my reply of an unfriendly nature.  
The information desired was not  
necessary to remove any doubts  
of his government on the points to  
which it applied, or to enable it to  
do justice to the United States, in  
regard to the aggression of which  
they complained. ‘The presump-  
tion that an embargo was intended  
gained strength from the circum-  
stance that most of the gazettes  
had recommended, and that the  
public mind seemed to be essen-  
tially prepared for it. It was my  
most earnest wish to prevent, as  
far as in my power, so unjust and  
pernicious a procedure. As the  
measure contemplated, whatever  
it might be, seemed to be suspend-  
ed for my answer, I was extremely  
solicitous, by the’ manner, to de-  
prive this government of all pre-  
  
AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
text for any measure of the kind  
alluded to. By replying general-  
ly, that I had no instructions from  
my government, and could state  
nothing on its part respecting the  
late occurrence, I avoided giving  
a direct answer to Mr. Canning’s  
queries ; and by drawing his atten-  
tion to the application which it was  
to be presumed would soon be made  
on the part of my government on  
that subject, I endeavoured to show  
more strongly the impolicy and in-  
justice which would stamp ary  
such measure on the part of Great  
Britain in the present stage.  
  
No step has yet been taken by  
this government of an unfriendly  
character towards the United  
States; and from the communica-  
tion which Mr. Canning made to  
the house of commons, on the day  
he received my last note, which  
you wiil find in the gazettes sent,  
I am persuaded that things will  
remain in the state in which they  
are, till your dispatch is received.  
I trust that a disposition exists to  
make such reparation on the point  
in question, as will be satisfactory  
to the United States, and that it  
wiil be practicable and not difiicult  
to preserve the friendly relations  
subsisting between the two coun-  
tries. The party, however, in fa-  
vour of war, consisting of the  
combined interests mentioned in  
my last, is strong and active, so  
that it is impossible to foresee the  
result.

By Mr. Canning&#x27;s queries in his last rtofe, I  
was led Co consider as preparatory to an emb ir­

and when it would be carried into ctlcct, if it was  
not intended to found some measure on my reply  
cl an uuirieiKlly nature. The information desir­  
ed was not necessary to remove any doubts of his  
government on the points to whiph it applied, or  
to enable it to do justice to the United States, in  
regard to the aggression of which they complain­  
ed. The presumption that an embargo was in­  
tended, gamed strength from the circumstance  
that most of the gazettes had recommended, and  
that the public mind seemed to be essentially pre­  
pared for it. It was my most earnest wish to  
prevent, as far as in my power, so unjust and per­  
nicious a procedure. As the measure contem­  
plated, whatever it. might he, seemed to be sus­  
pended for my answer, 1 was extremely solicitous |  
by tiic manner, te deprive this government of all  
pretext tor any of the kind alluded to. By re i  
plying generally, that I had no instructions from  
my government, and could state nothing on its  
part respecting the late occurrence, I avoided gi­  
ving a direct answer to Mr. Canning’s queries ;  
and by drawing his attention to the application  
w hich it was to be presumed would.soon be made  
on the part of my government, on that subject, I  
endeavered to shew more strongly the policy and  
injustice which would stamp any such measure  
on die part of Great Britain in the present stage.  
N» step has yet been taken by this government  
ot an untriendly character, towards the United  
States ; and from the communication w’hich Mr.  
Canning made to the House of Commons the  
day lie received my last note, which you will find  
in the gazettes sent, 1 am persuaded that things  
will remain in the state in which they are, till  
your dispatch is received. I trust that a disposi­  
tion exists to make such reparation on the point

Londony, August 14th, 1307. ;  
Sir—l had the henor to tranimit  
you with my letter of the 4th inst: a  
copy of a correspondence wich Mr.  
Canning, relative to the late aparef­  
fion in the case of the Chefapeuke  
frigate. You will receive with this a  
copy of a more recent oue on the  
fame fubjeQ. .  
- By #r. Canning’s queries in his last  
note, I was led to conlider as prepara.  
tory to an e.nbargo oa American vel­  
fels. I could not conceive why he  
should requaelt information of me,  
whether the President’s proclamation  
was autheatic, and when it would be  
carried into effe®, if it was ‘not in-  
  
tended to found some measure on my  
« teply, of an unfridadly nature. The  
information desired was not neceflary  
to remove any doubts of his govern­  
ment on the potats to which it applied,  
or to enable it to do justice to the U.  
States, in regard to the aggreflion of  
- whish they complained. The pre­  
fumptioa that an embargo was intend­  
ed gained strength from the circum­  
stance that most of the Gazettes had  
sdecommended, and that the public  
mind .feem=d to be essentially prepar­  
ed foric. It was my most earnelt with  
to prevent, as far as in my power, so  
unjaft and peroicious a p. cedure.  
As the measure contempl: d, what­  
- ever it might be, seemed to be sus­  
pended for my answer, I was extreme­  
ly solicitous, by the manner, to de­  
prive this government of all pretext  
for any of the kind alluded to. By  
replying generally that 1 had no in­  
ftru&amp;ions. from my government, and  
could Rate nothing on its part refpe&amp;-

giving a dire&amp; answer to Mr. Can­

attention to the application which it  
was to be presumed wculd soon be  
gnade on the part of my government,  
on that fubje, I endeavored to thew  
more strongly the impolicy and injus­  
tice which would stamp any {uch  
meafare on the part of G. Britain in

No &#x27; step bas yet been taken by this

towards the United States ; and from  
the communication which Mr, Can­

on the day he received my lalt note,

Sir;—I had the honour to transmit you  
with my letter of the 14th inst. a copy of a  
correspondence with Mr. Canning, reiative  
to. the late aggression in the case of the  
Chesapeake frigate. You will receive with  
this a copy of a more recent one on the same  
subject.—Mr. C.’s queries in his last note,  
I was led to consider as preparatory to an

conceive whty he should request information  
of me, whether the president’s proclamation  
was authentic, and when it would be carried

necessary to remove any doubts of his gos  
vernment on the points to which it applied,  
or to enable it to do justice to the U. States,  
in regard to the aggression of which they  
complained. The presumption that an em&lt;  
bargo was intended gained strength from  
the circumstance that most of the gazettes  
bad recommended, and that the public  
mind seemed to be essentially prepared for  
it. It was my most eurnest wish to prevent,  
as far as in my power, so unjust and perni-  
ciousa procedure. As the measure contems  
plated, whatever it might be, seemed to be  
suspended for my snswer, I was extremely

ed giving a direct answer to Mr. C.’s queries ;  
and by drawing his attention to the applica-

strongly the impelicy and injustice which  
would stamp any such measure on the part of  
G. Britain in the present stage-—No step
