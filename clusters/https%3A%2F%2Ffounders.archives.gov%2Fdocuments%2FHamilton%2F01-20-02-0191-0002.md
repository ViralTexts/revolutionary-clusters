ards it an affectionate and immoveable attachment—that you should watch for its preservation with jealous solicitude—that you should habituate yourselves to entertain think and speak of it as the palladium of your prosperity &amp; should frown upon whatever may lead to a suspicion that it can in any event be abandonned.  
To the efficacy &amp; duration of your Union a Government extending over the whole is indispensable. No alliance however intimate between the parts can be an adequate substitute. These must experience the infractions and interruptions, which all alliances in all times have experienced. Sensible of this important truth you have lately organised a Constitution of General Governt. better fitted than your former for a solid Union and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This Government, the offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers uniting energy with safety, and cir I have before touched on the motives which entitle it to your Confidence. Let me add that Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true Liberty The basis of our political systems is the right of the People to make and to alter their constitutions of Government. But the Constitution which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly binding upon all. The very idea of the right &amp; the power of the people to establish Government presupposes the obligation of every individual to obey the established Government.  
All obstructions to the execution of the laws. All combinations and associations under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct influence counteract or controul the regular deliberation or action of the constituted authorities are contrary to this fundamental principle and of the most fatal tendency. They serve to organise faction, to give to it an artificial and extraordinary force, to put in the stead of the delegated will of the Nation the will of a party, often a small but artful &amp; enterprising minority of the peop community; and according to the alternate triumphs of different parties to make the Public Administration the Mirror of the ill concerted and in congruous projects of faction rather than an organ of the well digested and wholesome plans digested by of common councils &amp; modified by mutual interests. However combinations and associations of this description may occasionally answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things to prove potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to erect their own greatness on the ruins of public Liberty; destroying afterwards the very engines by which they have been lifted to unjust dominion.  
  
Towards the preservation of Your Government, and with it your present happy condition, it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its authority, but also that you should be upon your guard against a spirit of Innovation upon its principles however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect alterations in the forms of the constitution tending to impair the energy of the System and so to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that Time and Habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of a Government as of any other human institution—that Experience is the surest standard by which to determine the real tendency of an existing constitution, that facility in changes upon the mere credit of hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual endless change from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion: And remember especially that for the efficacious management of your common concerns, in a country so extensive as ours, a Government of as much Vigour as is compatible with the perfect security of Liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself in such a Government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, will find its best guardian and protector.  
Let me, then, conjure you fellow Citizensextort you in the next place, in the most earnest manner to be upon your guard against the baneful effects of party Spirit. This Spirit unfortunately is inseparable from human Nature having its root in the strongest passions of the mind. It exists is seen under different shapes in all Governments more or less stifled controuled or repressed, but in those of the popular form it is always seen in its greatest rankness, and it is truly their worst enemy.

ch however ought not to be intirely put out of sight) the common and continual mischiefs of the Spirit of Party make it the interest and the duty of a wise people to discountenance and repress it.  
It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration—agitates the community with ill founded jealousies and false alarms—embitters one part against another, and produces occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens inlets for foreign corruption and influence, which find a facilitated access through the channels of party passions; causing the true policy and interest of our own country to be subservient to the policy and interest of a foreign country and enslaving the will of our own Government to the Will of a foreign Government.  
  
There is an opinion that parties in free countries are salutary checks upon the administration of the Government and serve to keep alive the spirit of Liberty. This within certain bounds is probably true, and in governments of a monarchical cast, patriotism may look with indulgence on the spirit of Party. But in governments of the popular character, in those purely elective, it is a spirit not to be fostered. From the natural tendency of such Governments, it is certain, that there will always exist enough of it for every salutary purpose; and there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it: A Fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest it should not only warm but consume.  
It is in a particular manner to be regretted that our parties for some time past have been too much characterised

y shield themselves against the jealousies, which grow out of these misrepresentations. They tend to render alien to each other, those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The Western Country have lately had a useful lesson on this subject. They have seen in the negotiation by the Executive and in the unanimous ratification by the Senate of the Treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout in U States how unfounded have been the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States inimical to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have seen two Treaties concluded, that with Great Britain and that with Spain which secure to them every thing they could desire, with respect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will they not henceforth rely for the preservation of these advantages on that Union by which they were procured?

It is very important likewise that the habits of thinking of the people should tend to inspire caution in their Agents, in the several departments of the Government, to avoid encroachment upon each other. and that as often as any precedent of the kind might occur that it should marked The spirit of encroachment in this respect leads to the consolidation of the powers of all the departments into one; and thereby, under whatever forms, to the establishment of a despotism. A just knowlege of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominate in the human heart are alone is sufficient to convince us of this truth. The necessity of mutual checks in the organisation of political power by dividing and distributing it into different depositories has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern, some of them in our own country and under our own eyes. If necessary to institute them, it is equally necessary to maintain them in practice. If in the public opinion the destribution of any of the powers of the Government be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an adm amendment in the course indicated by the Constitution.

re, good faith and justice towards and harmony with all Nations. Religion and Morality enjoin this Conduct. Can it be that true policy does not equally demand it? It will, at least, be worthy of a free, enlightened, and at not distant period, a great Nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people invariably governed by an exalted justice and benevolence. Whenever It is to be doubted that the fruits of such a conduct would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to the plan? Can it be that providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a Nation with its Virtue? The Experiment is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles ennobles human nature? Alas! It is rendered impossible by its Vices?  
Towards the execution of such a plan, it is material that while our impressions and sentiments make the proper distinctions between a friendly or unfriendly conduct of different foreign nations towards us—we nevertheless avoid rooted &amp; permanent antipathies against or passionate attachments for any; as a general rule cultivating just and amicable feeling towards all.
