To Thomas Jefferson, President of   
  
the United States.  
Baltimore 11th mo. 9th. 1807.  
  
  
We the representatives of the Yearly Meeting of Friends, for the Western Shore of Maryland, the adjacent parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the State of Ohio; being convened in the City of Baltimore, on those concerns which relate to our Society, apprehend that we feel our minds engaged to address thee, on behalf of ourselves, and the religious Society which we represent.  
Permit us to say, that whilst we desire to be preserved from intermedling with the policy of these Governments, under which we live, we believe it to be our indispensable duty, consistently with that Christian obligation, in relation to Governments; to “lead a quiet and peaceable life under them, in all godliness and honesty.”  
We feel gratitude to the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe, in that he hath influenced the Councils of the General Government of our country, to decide upon several important subjects, agreeably to the principles of eternal justice and right.  
Amongst the most prominent of these acts which claim our approbation, we are induced to notice, the evidence of thy efforts, to preserve our country from the calamities and ravages of War, by cultivating a disposition, and pursuing a conduct, marked with conciliation and friendship, towards all Nations with whom we have intercourse; thereby avoiding those grounds of dissension, which are often the sources, from whence this desolating scourge has its origin, to the reproach of Christianity. For as we are firmly persuaded of its obligation, as a religious principle, so it is our fervent desire, in regard to all men, that even the smallest germ of enmity, may be eradicated. And our ardent prayer to the Father of the Universe is, that thro the overruling order of his Providence, the hearts, and understandings, of his erring and contending creatures, may be illuminated, so to behold the excellency of brotherly affection, as to become willing to admit the spirit of universal reconciliation.  
We are also bound to acknowledge, those philanthropic exertions, which have been used, to ameliorate the condition of the Indian Natives, by introducing amongst them a knowledge of agriculture, and of some of the mechanic arts. We sincerely congratulate thee on their progress in civilization, and the very encouraging prospect, abundantly evinced, that this truly benevolent and laudable undertaking, will ultimately be crowned with the desired success—an undertaking which, whilst it increasingly obviates the wretchedness of their former condition, converts them from dangerous neighbours, to valuable friends.  
But, there remains a subject inexpressibly dear to our hearts, which has particularly engaged our feelings. We rejoice in the prospect of a termination to the wrongs of Africa, and that a traffic, heretofore legalised in a district of our country, in its nature, abhorrent to every just and tender sentiment, and reproachful to humanity, to say nothing of Christian principles, is interdicted by our Government. For the exertion of thy influence, united with the National Legislature (may we not say) to relieve our country from the complicated evils, attendant upon this cruel and inhuman trade, we are engaged, thro this medium, to testify our warmest approbation.  
And may the future Councils of our country, yield to the influence of Him, who is called “Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace”; so that the exercise of additional acts of justice and mercy, towards this greatly oppressed part of the Human Family, may utterly remove the cries of Oppression, from this highly favoured land.  
With sentiments of respect, due from us, to those, who, in the ordering of Divine Providence, are set over us, we are thy friends.  
Signed on behalf of the Meeting by   
  
Gerard T. Hopkins Clk.

of the Universe, iu that he hath influenced  
the councils of the General Government of  
our country, to decide upon several impor­  
tant [ubjets, agreeably to thie principles of  
cternal justice and right, ;  
Amonglt the most prominent of thofé aéts  
which claim our approbation, we are induc­  
ed to notice.the evidences of thy efforts to  
preserve our €cuntry from the calamitics  
and ravages of War, by eultivating a dispo­  
sition, and pursuing a conduct marked with  
conciliation and frrendthip towards all na­  
ticns with whom we have intercourse ;  
thereby avoiding those grounds of deflen:  
tion, which are often the sources from  
whence this desolating {courge has its ori­  
gin, to the reproach of Christianity. For,  
as&#x27;we are firmly purfuaded of its obligation  
as a religipus principle, so it 7is our fervent  
desire, in regard to all men, that even the  
smallest germ of enmity may be eradicated.  
And our ardent prayer to the Father of the  
Uaiverfe is, that through the over-ruling  
order of his Piovidenee, the hearts and un­  
derstandings of his erring and contending  
treatures, may be illuminated, so to behold  
the excellency of Lrotherly afic&amp;ion,_ as to  
become willing to admit the f{pirit&#x27;of uni­  
versal reconciliation.  
  
We are also bound to acknowledge those  
philanthropic exertions, which have been  
vled .to ameliorate the condition of the fa­  
dian natives, by introducing among them a  
@ knowledge of agriculture, and of some of  
the mechanic arts.. We sincerely congratu­  
late thee on their progress in civilization,  
and the very cncotiraging profpedt, abund­  
antly evinced, that this truly. benevolent  
and laudable undcrtaking will ultimately be  
crowned. with the desired success——an ua­  
dertaking, which, whilst it increasingly obvi­  
ates the wretchedness of their former con­  
dition, converts them from dangcrous neigh­  
bors to valuabte fricods. ; ..  
But there remains a fubje; inexpressibly  
dear to aur hearts, which has particularly  
interested our feelings. W rejoice in the  
prospect of a termination to the wrongs of  
Africa, and that a traffic, heretofore legalif­  
ed in a diltri€t of our country, in its nature  
abhorrent to every just and tender fcnti­  
anent, and reproachful to humanity, to fay  
nothing of chriftain principies, is. interdit­  
ed by our government. For the exertions of  
thy influence, ¥nited with the National Le­  
gillature, (day we not fay,)) to relicve our  
country, from the complicated evils attend­  
ant upon this cruel and inhuman trade, we  
“are engaged, through this mediom, 13 tefli­  
fy our warmest apprcbation.  
. And may the. future .Councils of oar  
Country, yield to the influence of° Him  
who 1s called « WoNperrUL &#x27; CCUNSELLER,  
«“The Micuty Gop, Prince o Prace 3&quot;  
so that the excrcife of additianal aé&amp;s of jul­

to renew our exhortations, that Friends every

hands clear of giving any encouragement, in  
any shape, to the slave trade, it being evi-  
dently destructive to the natural rights of  
mankind ; who are ransomed by one Savicur,  
and visited by one Divine light, in order to  
salvation; a traffic calculated to enrich and  
aggrandize some, upon the misery of others ;  
in its nature abhorrent to every just and tender

AN ADDRESS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON,  
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  
  
We, the Representatives of the Yearly Meet-  
ing of Friends for the Western Shore of Mary-  
land, the adjacent parts of Pennsylvania and  
Virginia, and the State of Ohio, being convened  
in the city of Baltimore, on those concerns  
which relate to our Society, apprehend that we  
feel our minds engaged to address thee on be-  
half of ourselves, and the religious Society  
which we represent. Permit us to say, that  
whilst we desire to be preserved from intermed-  
dling with the policy of those governments un-  
der which we live, we believe it to be our  
indispensable duty, consistently with that Chris-  
tian obligation, with relation to governments, to  
“lead a quiet and peaceable life under them, in  
all godliness and honesty.” We feel gratitude  
to the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe, in that  
he hath influenced the councils of the general  
government of our country, to decide upon sev-  
eral important subjects, agreeably to the princi-  
ples of eternal justice and right.  
  
Amongst the. most important of those acts  
which claim our approbation, we are induced  
to notice thy efforts to preserve our country  
from the ravages and calamities of war, by  
cultivating a disposition and pursuing a conduct  
marked with conciliation and friendship towards  
all those nations with whom we have inter-  
course ; thereby avoiding those grounds of dis-  
  
  
  
692 FRIENDS’  
sension which are often the sources from which  
this desolating scourge has its origin, to the  
reproach of Christianity.  
  
For, as we are firmly pursuaded of its obliga-  
tion as a righteous principle, so it is our fervent  
desire, in regard to all men, that even the  
smallest germ of enmity may be eradicated.  
  
And our ardent prayer to the Father of the  
Universe is, that, through the overruling order  
of his providence, the hearts and understandings  
of his erring and contending creatures may be il-  
luminated, so to behold the excellency of brother-  
ly affection, as to become willing to admit the  
spirit of reconciliation. We are also bound to  
ucknowledge those philanthropic exertions which  
have been used to ameliorate the condition of the  
Indian natives, by introducing amongst them a  
knowledge of agriculture, and some of the  
mechanic arts. We sincerely congratulate thee  
on their progress in civilization, and the very  
encouraging prospect abundantly evinced, that  
this truly benevolent and laudable undertaking  
will ultimately be crowned with the desired  
success—an undertaking which, whilst it in-  
creasingly obviates the wretchedness of their  
former condition, converts them from dangerous  
neighbors into valuable friends. But there  
  
remains a subject inexpressibly dear to our  
hearts, which was particularly interesting to our  
feelings.  
  
We rejoice in the prospect of a termination  
  
to the wrongs of Africa, and that a traffic, here-  
tofore legalized in a district of our country, in  
its nature abhorrent to every just and tender  
sentiment, and reproachful to humanity, to say  
nothing of Christian principles, is interdicted  
by our government. For the exertion of thy  
influence, united with the National Legislature  
(may we not say,) to relieve our country from  
the complicated evils attendant upon this cruel  
and inhuman trade, we are engaged; through  
this medium, to testify our warmest approbation.  
And may the future councils of our country  
yield to the influence of Him, who is called  
“ Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the  
Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace;” so  
  
that the exercise of additional acts of justice|  
  
and mercy, towards this greatly oppressed part  
of the human family, may utterly remove the  
cries of oppression from this highly favored land.  
With sentiments of respect due from us, to  
those who, in the ordering of Divine Providence,
