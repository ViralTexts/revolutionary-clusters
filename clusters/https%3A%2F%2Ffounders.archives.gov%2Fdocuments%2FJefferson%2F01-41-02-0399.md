To the  
Senate and  
House of representatives of the United States.  
  
In calling you together, fellow citizens, at an earlier day than was contemplated by the act of the last session of Congress, I have not been insensible to the personal inconveniencies necessarily resulting from an unexpected change in your arrangements. but matters of great public concernment have rendered this call necessary; and the interest you feel in these will supercede in your minds all private considerations.  
Congress witnessed, at their late session, the extraordinary agitation produced in the public mind by the suspension of our right of deposit, at the port of New Orleans, no assignment of another place having been made according to treaty. they were sensible that the continuance of that privation would be more injurious to our nation, than any consequences which could flow from any mode of redress. but reposing just confidence in the good faith of the government whose officer had committed the wrong, friendly &amp; reasonable representations were resorted to, and the right of deposit was restored.  
Previous however to this period, we had not been unaware of the danger to which our peace would be perpetually exposed, whilst so important a key to the commerce of the Western country remained under foreign power. difficulties too were presenting themselves as to the navigation of other streams, which, arising within our territories, pass through those adjacent. propositions had therefore been authorised for obtaining, on fair conditions, the sovereignty of New Orleans, &amp; of other possessions in that quarter interesting to our quiet, to such extent as was deemed practicable: and the provisional appropriation of two millions of dollars, to be applied &amp; accounted for by the President of the US. intended as part of the price, was considered as conveying the sanction of Congress to the acquisition proposed. the enlightened government of France saw, with just discernment, the importance to both nations of such liberal arrangements as might best and permanently promote the peace, friendship &amp; interests of both: and the property &amp; sovereignty of all Louisiana, which had been restored to them, has, on certain conditions, been transferred to the US. by instruments bearing date the 30th. of April last. when these shall have recieved the constitutional sanction of the Senate, they will, without delay, be communicated to the Representatives also, for the exercise of their functions as to those conditions which are within the powers vested by the constitution in Congress. whilst the property &amp; sovereignty of the Missisipi and it’s waters secure an independant outlet for the produce of the Western states, &amp; an uncontrouled navigation through their whole course, free from collision with other powers, &amp; the dangers to our peace from that source, the fertility of the country, it’s climate &amp; extent, promise, in due season, important aids to our treasury, an ample provision for our posterity, &amp; a wide spread for the blessings of freedom and equal laws.  
With the wisdom of Congress it will rest to take those ulterior measures which may be necessary for the immediate occupation, &amp; temporary government of the country; for it’s incorporation into our union; for rendering the change of government a blessing to our newly adopted brethren; for securing to them the rights of conscience &amp; of property; for confirming to the Indian inhabitants their occupancy &amp; self-government, establishing friendly &amp; commercial relations with them, &amp; for ascertaining the geography of the country acquired. such materials for your information, relative to it’s affairs in general, as the short space of time has permitted me to collect, will be laid before you when the subject shall be in a state for your consideration.  
Another important acquisition of territory has also been made, since the last session of Congress. the friendly tribe of Kaskaskia Indians, with which we have never had a difference, reduced, by the wars &amp; wants of savage life, to a few individuals unable to defend themselves against the neighboring tribes, has transferred it’s country to the US. reserving only for it’s members what is sufficient to maintain them, in an agricultural way. the considerations stipulated are, that we shall extend to them our patronage &amp; protection, &amp; give them certain annual aids, in money, in implements of agriculture, &amp; other articles of their choice. this country, among the most fertile within our limits extending along the Missisipi from the mouth of the Illinois, to, and up, the Ohio, tho’ not so necessary as a barrier, since the acquisition of the other bank, may yet be well worthy of being laid open to immediate settlement, as it’s inhabitants may descend with rapidity, in support of the lower country, should future circumstances expose that to foreign enterprise. As the stipulations, in this treaty also, involve matters within the competence of both houses only, it will be laid before Congress so soon as the Senate shall have advised it’s ratification.  
  
With many of the other Indian tribes, improvements in agriculture &amp; houshold manufacture, are advancing; and, with all, our peace &amp; friendship are established on grounds much firmer than heretofore. the measure adopted of establishing trading houses among them, &amp; of furnishing them necessaries in exchange for their commodities, at such moderate prices as leave no gain, but cover us from loss, has the most conciliatory &amp; useful effect on them, &amp; is that which will best secure their peace and good will.  
The small vessels authorised by Congress, with a view to the Mediterranean service, have been sent into that sea; and will be able more effectually to confine the Tripoline cruisers within their harbours, &amp; supercede the necessity of convoy to our commerce in that quarter. they will sensibly lessen the expences of that service the ensuing year.  
A further knowledge of the ground in the North Eastern, &amp; North Western angles of the US. has evinced that the boundaries, established by the treaty of Paris, between the British territories &amp; ours in those parts, were too imperfectly described to be susceptible of execution. it has therefore been thought worthy of attention, for preserving &amp; cherishing the harmony &amp; useful intercourse subsisting between the two nations, to remove by timely arrangements what unfavorable incidents might otherwise render a ground of future misunderstanding. a Convention has therefore been entered into, which provides for a practicable demarcation of those limits, to the satisfaction of both parties.  
An account of the reciepts &amp; expenditures of the year ending the 30th. of September last, with the [estimates] for the service of the ensuing year, will be laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury, so soon as the reciepts of the last quarter shall be returned from the more distant states. it is already ascertained that the amount paid into the treasury, for that year, will exceed  and that the revenue, accrued during the same term, exceeds the sum counted on, as sufficient for our current expences, &amp; to extinguish the public debt, within the period heretofore proposed.  
The amount of debt paid, for the same year, is about 3,100,000. Dollars, exclusive of interest, &amp; making, with the paiment of the preceding year, a discharge of more than eight millions &amp; an half of Dollars of the principal of that debt, besides the accruing interest: and there remain in the treasury nearly six millions of dollars. of these, 880,000. have been reserved for paiment of the first instalment due, under the British convention of Jan. 8. 1802. and two millions are, what have been beforementioned, as placed by Congress under the power &amp; accountability of the President, towards the price of New Orleans &amp; other territories acquired, which, remaining untouched, are still applicable to that object, and go in diminution of the sum to be funded for it.  
Should the acquisition of Louisiana be constitutionally confirmed &amp; carried into effect, a sum of nearly thirteen millions of Dollars will then be added to our public debt, most of which is paiable after fifteen years; before which term the present existing debts will all be discharged, by the established operation of the sinking fund. when we contemplate the ordinary, annual, augmentation of impost, from increasing population &amp; wealth, the augmentation of the same revenue, by it’s extension to the new acquisition, &amp; the economies which may still be introduced into our public expenditures, I cannot but hope that Congress, in reviewing their resources, will find means to meet the intermediate interest of this additional debt, without recurring to new taxes. and applying to this object only the ordinary progression of our revenue, it’s extraordinary increase, in times of foreign war, will be the proper and sufficient fund for any measures of safety or precaution, which that state of things may render necessary in our neutral position.  
Remittances for the instalments of our foreign debt having been found practicable without loss, it has not been thought expedient to use the power, given by a former act of Congress, of continuing them by reloans, &amp; of redeeming, instead thereof, equal sums of Domestic debt, although no difficulty was found in obtaining that accomodation.  
The sum of fifty thousand Dollars, appropriated by Congress for providing gunboats, remains unexpended. the favorable &amp; peaceable turn of affairs, on the Missisipi, rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary; &amp; time was desireable, in order that the institution of that branch of our force might begin on models the most approved by experience. The same issue of events dispensed with a resort to the appropriation of a million &amp; a half of dollars, contemplated for purposes which were effected by happier means.  
We have seen with sincere concern the flames of war lighted up again in Europe, &amp; nations with which we have the most friendly &amp; useful relations, engaged in mutual destruction. while we regret the miseries in which we see others involved, let us bow with gratitude to that kind providence, which, inspiring with wisdom &amp; moderation our late legislative councils, while placed under the urgency of the greatest wrongs, guarded us from hastily entering into the sanguinary contest, &amp; left us only to look on, &amp; to pity it’s ravages. these will be heaviest on those immediately engaged. yet the nations pursuing peace will not be exempt from all evil. in the course of this conflict, let it be our endeavor, as it is our interest &amp; desire, to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent nations by every act of justice, &amp; of innocent kindness; to recieve their armed vessels, with hospitality, from the distresses of the sea, but to administer the means of annoyance to none; to establish in our harbours such a police as may maintain law &amp; order; to restrain our citizens from embarking individually in a war in which their country takes no part; to punish severely those persons, citizen or alien, who shall usurp the cover of our flag, for vessels not entitled to it, infecting thereby with suspicion those of real Americans, &amp; committing us into controversies for the redress of wrongs not our own; to exact from every nation the observance, towards our vessels &amp; citizens, of those principles &amp; practices which all civilized people acknowledge; to merit the character of a just nation, &amp; maintain that of an independant one, preferring every consequence to insult &amp; habitual wrong. Congress will consider whether the existing laws enable us efficaciously to maintain this course, with our citizens in all places, &amp; with others while within the limits of our jurisdiction; &amp; will give them the new modifications necessary for these objects. Some contraventions of right have already taken place, both within our jurisdictional limits, &amp; on the high seas. the friendly disposition of the governments from whose agents they have proceeded, as well as their wisdom &amp; regard for justice, leave us in reasonable expectation, that they will be rectified &amp; prevented in future: &amp; that no act will be countenanced by them which threatens to disturb our friendly intercourse. separated by a wide ocean from the nations of Europe, &amp; from the political interests which entangle them together, with productions &amp; wants which render our commerce &amp; friendship useful to them, &amp; theirs to us, it cannot be the interest of any to assail us, nor ours to disturb them. we should be most unwise indeed, were we to cast away the singular blessings of the position in which nature has placed us, the opportunity she has endowed us with, of pursuing, at a distance from foreign contentions, the paths of industry, peace, &amp; happiness, of cultivating general friendship, and of bringing collisions of interest to the umpirage of reason, rather than of force. how desirable then must it be, in a government like ours, to see it’s citizens adopt individually the views, the interests, &amp; the conduct which their country should pursue, divesting themselves of those passions &amp; partialities, which tend to lessen useful friendships, &amp; to embarras &amp; embroil us in the calamitous scenes of Europe. Confident, fellow-citizens, that you will duly estimate the importance of neutral dispositions, towards the observance of neutral conduct, that you will be sensible how much it is our duty to look on the bloody Arena spread before us, with commiseration indeed, but with no other wish than to see it closed, I am persuaded you will cordially cherish these dispositions, in all discussions among yourselves, &amp; in all communications with your constituents. and I anticipate with satisfaction the measures of wisdom, which the great interests, now committed to you, will give you an opportunity of providing, &amp; myself that of approving, and of carrying into execution, with the fidelity I owe to my country.

I Another important acqtitfit  
  
tory has alio been made hnce  
  
fion of Congrefs. The friendly tribe of  
iCafkafkia Indians, with which we have  
never had a difference, reduced by the  
wars and wants of a favage life, to a few  
individuals unable to defend themfelve3a­  
ainft the neighbouring tribes, has tranf­

choice. This country, among the moft  
fertile of our limits, extending along thj  
Milftffinpi from the mouth of thelllino  
to, and up the Ohio, though tiothrvecei  
fary as a barrier, fince the&quot; acquihtidh of

this treaty alfo, involve matters wifiin jhe  
  
competence of both houfes only, itjwill be  
laid before Congrefs fo foori as. theSenate  
(hall have advifed its ratification.  
Witl many of the other llndia: tribes,  
improvements in agrrcurture and hbufe­  
hold manufatl:ure, are advancing j and,  
with all, our peace, and friendfti?p; are ef­  
tablifhed on grounds much firmer than  
heretofore. The meafure adopted of eftab­  
iilhing trading houfes among thejn, and of  
furnifhing them neceflaries in change  
for their commodities at fuch inoderate  
prices, as to leave no gain, but cover us  
from lofs, has the moft conciliatory arid  
ufeful effect on them and is thai which  
will beft fecure their peace and good wilL

To the Senate and House of  
Representatives of tbe United Staff i :  
In calling you together, fellow-citizens, at an  
earlier day than was contemplated by the act of the  
last session of Congress, I have not been insensi­  
ble to the personal inconveniencies necessarily re­  
sulting from an unexpected change in your arrange­  
ments; but matters of exeat public concernment  
*. &gt; J.  
have rendered this tall necessary; and the interests  
you feel in these will supersede in your minds all  
private considerations-  
Congress witnessed, at their late session, the ex­  
traordinary agitation produced in the public mind  
by the suspension of our right of deposit, at the  
port of New Orleans, no assignment of another  
pine c having been made according to treaty. They  
were sensible that the continuance of that privation  
would be more injurious to our nation, than any  
consequences which could flow from a-.iy mode of  
redress. But reposing just confidence in the good  
faith of the government whose officer had commit­  
ted the wrong, friendly and reasonable lepreser.ta­  
tions were resorted to, and the right of deposit v as  
restored.  
Previous however to this period* we had not  
teen unaware of the danger to which our peace  
vould be perpetually exposed, whilst so important  
a key to the commerce of the western country re­  
mained under foreign power. Difficulties too were  
presenting themselves as to the navigation of other  
sti earns, which, arising within our territories, pass  
through those adjacent. Propositions had there­  
fore been authorised for obtaining:*, on fair condi­  
tiois, the sovereignty of New-Orleans, and of other  
possessions in that quarter interesting to our quiet,  
to such extent as was deemed practicable; and  
the provisional appropriation of two millions of  
dollars, to be applied and accounted for by the  
President of the United States, intended as part of  
the price, was considered as conveying the sanction  
of Congress to the acquisition proposed. The  
enlightened government cf France saw, with just  
discernment, ,(he importance to both nations of  
such liberal arrangements as might&quot; best and per­  
manent&#x27;} promote the peace, friendship and inter­  
li: and the property and sovereignty of  
all Louisiana, which had been restored to them,

ds to oar treasury, an ample pro­  
vision for our posterity, and a wide spread for  
the blessings of freedom and equal laws.  
With the wisdom of Congress it will rest to* tafcfc  
those ulterior measures which may be necessary  
for the immediate occupation, and temporary go­  
vernment of the country ; for its incorporation in­  
to our union; for rendering the change oi govern­  
ment a blessing to our newly adopted brethren ;  
for securing to them the rights of conscience and  
of property ; for confirming to the Indian inhabi­  
tants their occupancy and self-government, esta­  
blishing friendly and commercial relations with  
them, and ior ascertaining the geography of the  
country acquired. Such materials for your infor­  
mation relative to its uilairs in general, as the short  
sj ace of time has permitted me to collect; will be  
laid before you when the subject shall be in a state  
for your consideration*.  
Another important acquisition of territory has al­  
so been made, since the last session of Congress.  
The friendly tribe of Kaskaskia Indians, with  
which we have never had a difference, reduced, by  
the wars and wants of savage life, toa few individu­  
als unable to defend themselves againstthc leigh­  
bouriag tribes, has transferred its country to the  
United States, reserving only for its members what  
is sufficient to maintain them, in an agricultural  
way. The considerations stipulated ;o- that we  
shall extend to them our patronage and protection,  
and give them certain annual aids,in money, in im­  
plements of agriculture, and other article s of their  
choice. This country, among the most fei tile with-  
  
ugh not so necessary as a barrier, since the ac­  
quisition of the other bank,may vet be Well worthy  
of being laid open to immediate settlement as its  
inhabitants may descend with rapidity in support  
of the lower . mntry, should future circumstances  
expose that to foreign enterprise. As the stipula­  
tions, in this treaty also, involve matters within the  
tipetence of both houses only, it will be laid be­  
fore Congress so soon as the Senate shall have ad­  
vised its ratification. «  
With many of the other Indian tribes, improve­  
ments in agriculture and house-hold manufacture,  
are advancing ; and, with all, our peace and friend­  
ship are established on grounds much firmer than  
heretofore. The measure adopted -of establishing  
trading-houses among them a*(l of furnishing them  
necessaries in exchafige for their commodities, at  
such moderate prices as leave no gain, but cover  
us from loss, has the most conciliatory and useful  
eftect on them, and is that which will best secure  
their peace and good will.  
The small vessels authorised by Congress, with  
a view to the Mediterranean service, have been  
sent info that sen • and will be able more effectually  
to confine the Tripoline cruisers within their har­  
bours, and supersede the necessity of convoy to  
our commerce in that quarter. They will sensibly  
lessen the expences of that service the ensuing  
A further knowledge of the ground in the north  
eastern, and north western angles of the United  
States has evinced that the boundaries established  
by &lt;he treaty of uaris, between the British territo­  
ries and ours in those parts, were too imperfectly  
described to be susceptible of execution* It has  
therefore been thought worthy of attention, for  
preserving and cherishing the harmony and useful  
intercourse subsisting between the two nations, to  
remove by timely arrangements what Unfavorable  
incidents might otherwise render a ground of  
future misunderstanding. A convention has  
therefore been entered into, which provides for a  
practicable demarcation of those limits, to the  
satisfaction of both parties.  
An account of the receipts and expenditures of  
the year ending the 30th of September last, with  
the estimates for the service of the ensuing year,  
will be laid before you by the Secretary of the  
Treasury, so soon as the receipts of the last quar­  
ter shall be returned from the more distant states.  
It is already ascertained that the amount paid in­  
to the treasury, for that year, has been between  
eleven and twelve millions of dollars, and that the  
revenue, accrued during the same term, exceeds  
the sum counted on, as sufficient for our current  
expences, and to extinguish the public debt, with­  
in the period heretofore proposed.  
The amount of debt paid, for the same year, is  
about three millions one hundred thousand dollars,  
exclusive of interest, and mkking, with the pay­  
ment of the preceding year, a discharge of more  
than eight millions and an half of dollars of the  
principal of that debt, besides the accruing inter­  
est : and there remain in the treasury nearly six  
millions of dollars. Of these eight hundred and  
eighty thousand have been reserved for payment of  
the first instalment due, under the British Conven­  
tion e&gt;f January 8, 1802, and two millions arc,  
what have been before mentioned, as placed by  
Congress under the power and accountability of the  
President, towards the price of New Orleans and  
other territories acquired, which, remaining un­  
touched, are still applicable to that object, and go  
in diminution of the sum to be funded for it.  
Should the acquisition of Louisiana be consti­  
tutionally confirmed and carried into effect a sum  
of nearly thirteen millions of dollars will then be  
added to our public debt, most of-which is payable  
after fifteen years ; before which term, the present  
existing debts will all be discharged, by the esta­  
blished operation of the sinking fund. When we  
contemplate the ordinary, annual, augmentation  
of impost from increasing population and wealth,,  
the augmentation of the same revenue, by its ex­  
tension to the new acquisition, and the economies  
which may still be introduced into our public ex­  
penditures, I cannot but hope that Congress, in  
reviewing their resources will find means to meet  
the intermediate interest of this additional debt,  
without recurring to new taxes, and applying to  
this object only the ordinary progression of our  
revenue. lis extraordinary increase, in times of  
foreign war, will be the proper and sufficient fund  
for any measures of safety or precaution, which  
that state of things may render necessary in our  
neural position.  
Remittances for the instalments of our foreign  
debt having been found practicable without loss, it  
has not been thought expedient to use the power,  
given by a former act of Congress, of continuing  
them by reloans, and of redeeming, instead there­  
of, equal sums of domestic debt, although no difli-

the means of annoyance to none; to establish in

ing individually in a war in which their coun­  
try takes no part;

sition of the governments  
from whose agents they have proceeded, as well as  
their wisdom and regard for justice, leavers in rea­  
sonable expectation, that they wili be rectified an I  
prevented in future : and that no act will be coun­  
tenanced by them which threatens to disturb our  
friendly intercourse. Separated by a wide ocean  
from the nations of Europe, and from the  
political interests which entangle them together,  
with productions and wants which render our com­  
merce and friendship useful to them, and theirs to  
us, it cannot be the interest *of any to assail us, nor  
ours to disturb them. We should be most unwise  
indeed were we to cast away the singular bles­  
sings of the position in which nature has placed  
us, the opportunity she has endowed us with  
of pursuing, at a distance from foreign conten­  
tions, the paths of industry, peace, and happi­  
ness, of cultivating general friendship, and  
of bringing collisions of interest to the umpirage  
of reason, rather than of force. How desirable  
then must it be, in a governmennt like oilrs, to set­  
its citizens adopt individually the views, the inter­  
ests, and the conduct whichtheir country should  
pursue, divesting themselves of those passions and  
partialities, which tend to lessen useful friendships,  
and to embarrass and embroil us* in the calamitous  
scenes of Europe. Confident, fellow citizens, that  
you will duly estimate the importance of neutral  
dispositions, towards the observance of neutral con­  
duct, that you will be sensible how much it is our  
duty to look on the bloody Arena spread before us,  
with commiseration indeed, but with no other  
wish than to see it closed, I am persuaded yon  
will cordially cherish these dispositions, in all dis­  
cussions among yourselves, and in all communica­  
tions with your constituents. And I anticipate  
with satisfaction the measures of wisdom, which  
the great interests now committed to you, will give  
you an opportunity of providing and ?ny self that of  
approving, and of carrying into execution, with the  
fidelity I owe to my country,

To :h- Senate and Sfiuteof  
Rehre*r:tta(ive* jf the ffr.&#x27;tej S&#x27;atca :  
In Call inf; you together, fellow citizens,  
ftt an earlier day than w.v; contemplated  
by the : I of the last cession of Congress,  
have not been insensible to the personal  
mconvcnienctes necessarily resulting from  
bji unexpe led c range in your arrange­  
ments ; hut matters of great public con­  
cern nent have rendered this call neressa­  
rv ; md the interests y &gt;ti fvd in these will  
sunercede in your mini;, all private consi­  
tle *.\t ions.  
C digress witnessed, at their late sessi­  
on, the extra vdinury agitation produced  
in the public mind by the suspension of  
c&gt; ir right of deposit, at the part of New­  
Orleans, no assignment of another place  
V mug hern mads: according to treaty.  
They were sensible that the continuance  
of that pri /ation would be more injurious  
to our nation, than any consequences which  
c ndd flow from a;iv mode oT redress. But  
reposing iust confidence in the good faith  
o&#x27;- toe -ovemment whose odicer had com ■  
* niitted the urrrng, friendly md reasonable  
representations were reson tad to, and the  
rig1&#x27; of deposit was restored.  
Previous however t &gt; this peri &gt;d, we had  
nr been unaware of the danger to which  
our ix:ace would.lie. perpetually exposed,  
•w hilst so important a key to the commerce  
of the western country remained under fo­  
reign power. OiYicnkics too were nrr­  
  
renting themselves as to the navi ration uF  
other streams, which, arising within our  
territories, pass through those adjacent.  
Propor tions liiv! therefore b. .m authori­  
sed .or obtain ng, on fair condtu ,ivp the  
sovereignty-of Slew-v Mea*s, ard of other  
possessions In that quarter interesting to  
our quid, to surh extent as was deemed  
practicable ; a.id the provisional approuri­  
ati &gt;n of two millions of foliar*, to be appli­  
ed ami accounted for by the President of  
the. United Sta’es, intern led as part of  
the price, was considered as conveying the  
■junction of Congress to the acquisition  
projv&gt;«ed. The enlightened government  
ot France, saw, with in it discern nent, the  
importance to both nations orsucfi liberal  
at m ige-nents as might bes* and perm­  
Tienitv promote the peace, friendship „.,.j  
interests of both : and the irooerty : n 1  
s-m-reignty of aFi Lo .iidana, which hud  
been restored to them, has, on certain  
conditions been transferred to the United  
States bv instruments bearing date the  
.Tutu of \pri! last. When these shall  
^ ve received the constitutional s:*n5Vu&gt;n  
the Senate, they will, without delay, b£  
r.municated to the Representatives, al­  
for »he exercise of their fun Viom as to  
conditions which are within the pow­

tent, promise, in due season, important  
a. h to our treasury, an ample provision  
for onr posterity, and a wide spread for  
fhe blessings* of freedom and equal laws.  
Vita the wisdom 0r Congress j  
res* to take th.ise ulterior measures whfoh  
mav lie ner&lt;mnkty for the immediate c,ccu­  
p»ti**n. and temporary government of the

ing to the Indian inhabitants their occu­  
pancy and self-government, establishing  
friendly and coin mere,: 1 relations with  
them, and for ascertaining thC ge •gvaphy  
of the country acquired. Such materials  
for your inhumation relative to its affairs  
in general, as the short &amp;pac.e of time  
lias permitted me to collect, will be Liid  
before you when the tubjeCl shall be in a  
state for your consideration.  
.Another important acquisition of ter­  
ritory has also been made, since the last  
session of Congress. The friendly tribe  
of Kaskaskia Indians, with which we have  
never had a difference, reduced, by the  
wars and wants of savage life, to a few in­  
dividuals Unable to defend themselves a­  
g.iinst tne neighboring tribes, has trans­  
ferred its country to the United States, re­  
serving only for its members what is sutfi­  
ent to maintain them, in an agricultural  
way. The considerations stipulated afre,  
that we shall extend to them our patron­  
age and protection, and give them ce» .tin  
annual aids, in money, in implements of  
agriculture* and other articles r»r their  
choice. This country, among the mo*  
fertile within our limits,&quot;extending along  
the&quot; Mississippi from the mouth of the II­  
to* stiul upj the \ *tll &gt;&gt; though not SO  
necessary a. ub.-.iier, since the acquisiti*  
on of the other b.uik, may vet be well wor­  
thy of being laid open to immedi itc^t ith*­  
tuent, as its inhabitants may desce id with  
rapidity in support of the !&#x27; ver country,  
should future circumstances expose that  
to foreign enterprise. As the stipulations,  
in this treaty also, involve mailers within  
tl.c competence of both houses only, ;t  
will be laid &#x27;u-foit* rVuiim*,. ...  
  
the Senate shall have advised its ratifica­  
tion,  
Vith many of the other Indian tribes,  
impicJVcrnents in agriculture and house*  
hold manufacture, are advancing; anti,  
with ail, our peace and friendship are es.a­  
blishcd on grounds much firmer than here­  
tofore. The measure adopted of establish­  
ing tr&#x27;ding-houses .1 non;; them and of  
furnishing them neceisaries in exchange  
for their commodities, at such moderate  
prices as leave 10 gain, but cover us from  
loss, has the most conciliatory and useful  
cfnsd 00 them, and is that which will  
bt&#x27;i secure their peace and good will.  
The si ml 1 vessels authorised bv Con­  
gress, with a view to the Mediterranean  
Service, have been sunt into that sea ; an l  
vdll lie able more efie dually to confine the  
Tvipoline cruisers within their harbours,  
and supercede cue necessity of conv &gt;v to  
our co Tvnerce in that quarter. They will  
sensibly lessen the expenses of that service  
the ensuing year.  
A further knowledge of the ground in  
the north eastern, and north western an­  
gles nf the United States has evince I that  
the boundaries eatablishe » by the treaty of  
I aris, heVwe n Ihfc British lerrihir&#x27;eii and  
ours in those parts, were too i npcrfe dly  
described to be susceptible of execution.  
It has therefore horn thought worthy of at­  
tention, f&gt;r preserving and cherishing the  
M trnnony and useful intercourse subsisting  
between the two nations, to remove by  
timely arrangements what unfavorable in­  
ci tenis might otherwise render a ground  
of future misunderstanding. A conven­  
tion has therefore been entered into,  
which provides for a practicable durnar­  
catiou of those limits, to the satisfaction  
ol both parties.  
An account of the receipts and expen­  
ditures of the year ending the loth cl Sep­  
t*»nber ast, with the estimates for fhe ser­  
vice of the ensuing year, will hr laid tie­  
fore vou by the Secretary »f the Treasury,  
»o coon a.&lt; the receipts of the last &lt;Jt: tar ter  
  
s.uH be returned from the more distant  
siates. It is already ascertained that the  
amount paid into the treasury, fur that  
y:ar, has been between eleven and twelve  
. millions of dollars, and that the revenue,  
accrued during the same term, exceeds  
tl 4 sum counted on, as sufticient fir our  
errent expenses, and to extinguish the  
public debt, within the period heretofore  
pm posed.  
The amount of debt paid, for the same  
ytar. is about three millions one hundred  
thousand dollars, exclusive of interest, and  
n&gt; iking, with the payment r.f the prece­  
ding year, a discharge of more than eight  
motions and an half • f dollars of the prin­  
cipal of that debt, besides the accruing  
interest: a id there remain in the treasu­  
ry nearly six millions of dollars. Of these  
c&#x27;.ght hundred and eighty thousand have  
• b«&lt;*n reserved for payment of the first in­  
stilment due, under the ftrittKb Conventi­  
on ol January S, 180‘2, and two millions  
are what have been be fore mentioned, as  
placed bv Congress under this power and  
accountability of the President, towat Is  
the price or New (Orleans, and 6thcm ter­  
ritories acquired, which remaining un­  
* touched, are still applicable to that ob­  
j • -&#x27;v and go in diminution of the sum to be  
&#x27; funded for it.  
*h ndd the acquisition of Lousiaua be  
ct nstitutianally confirmed and carried into  
C‘e d a sum of nearly thirteen millions of  
dollars will then be added to our public  
debt, mast ol which ia payable after fif­  
teen \eav-i ; before which term, the pre­  
seat existing debts will all he discharged,  
by the established operation of the sink­  
int fund. When we comtetnplate the  
or tinary, annual, augmentation of impost  
from increasing population and wealth,  
the augmentation of the same revenue,  
  
WAVi.-n.-’ii no▼ dt, jtM&#x27;ji.lUll,  
a.il the economies wfich still m.iv be in­  
fiYi&#x27;ncerl &#x27;■,*») uni •vibhc expenditures. I  
ca mot but hope* that Congress,, in review*  
in«T their resource, will find means to meet  
!ht intermediate interest of this addition­  
al debt* without recurring to new ‘axes,  
and applying to thisobje Aonly the ordinary  
progression of our revenue. It* extra &gt;r  
&lt;li&quot;ary increase in times of foreign war,  
will be the proper undsuTicieutfund foruny  
r&amp;t amt res of safety or precaution, whkT.  
tlut state of things rncy render necessary  
in our neutral position.  
Remittances for the instalments of cur  
for. &#x27; gn debt having been found practica­  
ble without loss it has not been thought  
t ; c&lt;Keir to use the power given l»v a for­  
rr.: • art of Congress, of continuing them  
by reloans, and of redeeming, instead  
thereof, equal rums of domestic debt, al­  
though no difficulty was found in obtain  
ing that accommodation.  
The sum of fifty thousand dollars ap­  
propriated by Congress for providing gun­  
boat*, remains uAexpcnrtc I. TheTavor­  
abl“ and peaceable turn &lt;•? aTairs on the  
Mississippi, rendered an immediate exe­  
c con of that lav/ unnecessary; and time  
w &#x27; desirable in order tint the institution  
of that- branch of our force might begin  
on models the most approved by experi­  
ctre. The same issue of events dispen­  
ses with a resort to the appropriation of a  
million and a half of dollar* contemplated  
for purpose* which were effected by hap­  
pier mean*:. ‘  
We have seen with sincere concern the  
Pames of war lighted up again Europe,  
end nations with which we have the most  
friendly and useful relations, engaged in  
niatnal d«stru6hon. While we regret the  
m terres in which we see others involved,  
Vr is bow with gratitude to that kind Pro­  
vince,which inspiring with wisdom fctno­  
d« itwr, our late legislative councils, while  
phred vnder the urg ncy of the greatest  
wwugs, guarded ut from hastily entering  
  
into the sanguinary contest, and left us on­  
ly to look on and to pity its ravages.  
These will be heaviest on rho.o itnrn &gt; i*  
ately engaged ; yet the nations pursuing  
peace will not be exempt from ala evil.  
In the bourse fif this conflict lot’t be cur  
eudeaVor as it is our interest and desire,  
to cultivate the* friendship of the btllige­  
rent nations by every act of justice and  
of innocent kindness ; to receive their ar­  
med vessels, with hospitality from the d:~­  
treasev of the sea, but to administer the  
means of annoyance to none : to es .Midi  
in our harbours, such a police as may  
maintain law and order ; to restrain  
our citizens from embarking individu­  
ally in a war in which their country takes

and, with alt, our peace and friendship  
| are sstahliahed an grounds much firmer  
I than heretofore. The measure adopted  
! of cataUmhing trading houses among

in exchange for their commodities, at  
such moderate prices as leave no gain,  
hut cover us from loss, has the Most con­

will be able more effectually to confine  
the Tripobnc cruisers within &#x27;their har­  
boura, and supersede the neccasity of

They will sensibly lessen the expenses  
of that service the ensuing year.  
• A further knowledge of the ground la  
the north eastern, and north western an*  
gles of dm United States has evinced  
that the boundaries establised by the tree*  
tp of Paris, between the British territo*  
net and ours hi those parts, were too  
imperfectly prescribed to be susceptible  
of execution. It has therefore been tho*t  
of attention for preserving and  
moony and useful inter­  
betweea thetwo nati­  
ons, to remove by timely arrangements  
what unfavourable incidents might other­  
wise render a ground of future misunder­  
standing. A convention has therefore  
been entered into which provides for a  
practicable demarcation of those liaaits  
to die satisfaction of both parties  
An account of the receipts and expen­  
- 30th of  
ditom of the peer ending the__  
September last, with the estimates foi  
the services of the ensuing year, will b&lt;  
laid before you by the secretary of the  
treasury, soseoues dm receipts of th&lt;  
last quarter shad be returned from tht  
more distant states. It is ahresdv aacer  
tamed that the amount paid‘into tht  
treasury, for that year, has been betwetr  
11 and « millions of dollars, and that  
the revenue, accrued during the same  
term, exceeds the sum counted on, at  
sufficient for our current expenses, and  
to extinguish the public debt, within the  
period heretofore proposed.  
Tim amount of die debt paid, for th«  
•tone yeftr, it about three millions one  
hundred thousand dollars, exclusive ol  
interest, Ac, nuking with the payment  
of the preceding year, a discharge ol  
mare than eight millions and sa hslf ol  
dollars ofths principal ofthstdefe, be­  
sides the accruing interest: nod there  
remains in the treasury nearly 6 millions  
of dollars. Qf these eight hundred and  
eighty eight thousand for pavment of the  
first instalment due, under the British  
Convention of January *, IMS, and two  
millions are what have been before men­  
tioned, as placed by Congress under the  
power and accountability of the president,  
towards the price of Nev-Oncans and  
other territories acquired, which, re­  
maining untouched, are stUl applicable  
to that object, aad go in diminution of  
thq sum to be funded for it.  
Should the acquisition of Louisiana be  
constitutionally confirmed and carried in*  
to fKct a sum of nearly thirteen minions  
ofdollars will then be added to our public  
debt, moat of which is payable after fif­  
teen years t before which form the pre­  
sent existing debt will be discharged, by  
the established operation of thq sinking  
fund. When we contemplate the ordi­  
nary, annual, tngmrmrioa of

l ?  
  
troduced into our public expenditures, I  
cannot but hope that Congress, in review­  
ing their mtuut will find means to  
meet the intermediate interest of this ad­  
ditional debt, without recurring to new  
taxes, and applying to this object only  
theordiaal progression of our revenue.  
Its extraordinary increase, in times of  
foreign war, wifi be the proper and suf­  
ficient fund for any measures qf safety or  
precaution, which that state of,things  
may render necessary in our neutral po­  
si lion.  
Remittances for the instalments of our  
foreign debt having been found practica­  
ble without loss, it has not been thought  
expedient to use the power, given by a  
former act of Congress, of continuing  
them by reloans, and of redeeming, in­  
stead thereof, equal sums of domestic  
debt, although no difficulty was found  
in obtaining that accommodation.. The  
sum of fifty thousand dollars, appropria­  
ted by Congress for providing gun boats,  
remains unexpended. The mvoursble  
and peaceable turnofttfairs on the Mis­  
sissippi, rendered anjm mediate executi­  
on of that law unnecessary j and time ,  
was desirable, in order that the. institu­  
tion of that branch of our force might be­  
in on models the most approved by ex­  
rience. .The same issue of events dis­  
used with a resort to the i  
Y to the appropriation  
a million and an half of dollars, coh­  
plated for purposes which ware  
ed by happier .means. 2  
We have seen with sincere concern  
die flames of war lighted up again in  
Europe, and nations with which we have  
die most friendly and useful relations,  
engaged in mutual destruction. Whi]k  
we regret the miseries iu which we  
see others involved let us bow with gra­  
titude to that kind Providence, which  
inspiring with wisdom and moderation  
our latelegislative councils,while placed  
under the urgency of the grcateStwrongs,  
guarded us from hastily entering into  
me sanguinary contest, and lelt us holy  
to look on and to pity its ravages.* These  
win be heaviest on those immediately en­  
gaged | yet the nations pursuing peace

course of this conflict let it be our endea­

cultivate the friendship of the belligerent  
nations by every act of justice and inno­  
cent kindness: to receive their armed

Congress witnessed, at their last session,  
the extraordinary agitation produced in the  
public mind by the suspension of our right  
of deposit, at the port of New-Orleans,  
no assignment of another place having  
been made according treaty. They  
were sensible that the continuance of that

nation, than any consequences which could  
But re-  
posing just confidence in the good faith of  
the government whose officer had commit-  
ted the wrong, friendly and reasonable re-  
presentations were resorted to, and the  
right of deposit was restored.  
  
Previous however to this period, we had  
not been unaware of the danger to which  
our peace would be perpetually exposed,  
whilst so important a key to the commerce  
of the western country remained under  
foreign power. Difficulties too were pre-

your arrangements 1 but mauets of great, public  
concernment have rendered this call neceflary ;  
and the interefts you feel ia tbefe will fupeifede  
in ypur minds all private confiderations..  
. Congrefs witneffed, at their laft ftflion, the ex­  
traordinary agitation produced in the public mind  
by the fufpenfion of our right of depofit at the  
pert&quot; of New Orleans, no aflignment of another  
place having been&#x27; made according to treaty  
They were fenftble that the continuance of that  
privation would be more injurious towir nation,  
than any confequences which cou&#x27;d flow from  
any mode of tedrefs. But repofmg jufl confidence  
in the good faith of the government uihafe officer  
had committed the wrong., friendly and reafona­  
bl reprefentations were refortedto, and the right  
of. depofit was reftored..  
Previous however to this period, we had not  
been unawaie of the danger to which our peace  
would be perpetually expofed, whilft Co import­  
ant a key to the commerce of the wefiern country  
remained under foreign power. Difli ulties.too  
were prefenting themfclves di to the nav:gt;on of  
other ifreams, which, arif.ng within our territo­  
ries, pafs through thof; adjacent. Pfopoutioos  
had therefore been authored for obtainin2, on  
fair conditions, theTfovereinty of New Orleans,  
and of other poileflions in that quaiter intercuing  
to our quiet; to fuch etent as was deemed prac­  
ticable 7 &quot;and the praviftonal appropriation of two  
millions of dollars, to be applied and accounted  
for by the Pielident of the U. S. intended as

Another important acquiOtion of  
territory has alfo -been aade fi ice the  
la ft feffion of Congrcls. The friend­  
ly tribe ol Kaflcifkia Indians, with  
whicn we.fuve never had a difre­  
renct, reduced, by the wars and  
wants of lavage lite, to a few indi.  
viduals unable to defend themfelves  
agamft the neighbouring tribes, has  
transferred its country to the Unit­  
ed States,referving only for ismem  
bers what is fufltcient to maintain  
them, in an agricultural way. The  
confederations ftipulaced are, that  
we fhall extend to them our patron­  
age atid protection, and g&#x27;.ve them  
certain annual aids, in money, m  
loiplemenUof agriculture, and other  
articles of their choice. This coun­  
try, among the moft fertile within  
i ourr liojjts, extending along the Mif­  
j fifTippi from the mouth of the Illu  
noir to, and up the Ohio, though  
j not fo neceflaiy as ,a barrier fmce  
J the acquihuon ot the othr bank,  
j may yej be wel worthy &quot;cf being  
laJ(i 0pn to immediate fcttlement,  
its inhabitants may defcend with ra  
pidity in fuppoxtof the lower coun­  
try, ihould future circumftanccs  
expole that to foreign enterprizc.  
As the ftipulations in this treaty alfo  
involye matters within the compe­  
tence bf both iioufe only, it will  
be laid before Congrefs, fo loon as  
the Seaate fhall have advifed its ra­  
tification. .  
With many of the other Indian  
tribes, improvements in agriculture  
and hauthohi manufactures are ad­  
vancing: and witbal, our peace  
and friendfhip are eftablifhed on  
grounds much firmer than hereto­  
fore The meafure adopted of eftab­  
lifhing trading houlcs among them,  
and of furnifJiing them witn necef-  
faries in exchange for their commo  
dities, at fuch moderate prices as  
leave no gain, hut cover ws from lofs,  
has the moft conciliatory a-nd uteful  
effect on them, &#x27; and is thit which  
will beft fecure tiieir peace and good  
will. -  
The final 1 vefTek authorized by  
GongrelVwith a view to the Misd.

Yo the Senate and Hufe (;/&#x27;  
Reprefentatives of the United States :  
N calling you together, Fellow-  
R Citizens, at an earlier day than  
was contemplated by the a&amp; of the  
ft feflion of Congrefs, I have not  
en infenfible to the perfonal incon­  
eniencies neceffarily refulting from  
n unexpefted change in your ar­  
rangements ; but matters of great  
public concernmznt have rendered  
this call neceffary ; and the interelts  
you feel in thefe will fupercede in your  
minds all private confiderations. ,  
Congrels witnefled, at their late  
foflion, the extraordinary agitation  
‘roduced in the public mind by the  
Afpenfion of our right of depofit, at  
he port of New-Orleans, no aflign.  
nent of another place having besn  
lade according to treaty. They were  
fible that t%\e continuance of that  
&amp; vVation would be more injurious to  
’&amp;nation, than any confequences  
Boh h could flow from any mode of  
3. But repofing jult confidence  
ral 8 oood faith of the government  
e officer had committed the  
ngy friendly and reafonable repre­  
ations were reforted to, and the  
pht of depofit was reftored.  
3 Previous however to this period,  
  
ve had not been unaware of the dan­  
ser to which our peace would be pet­  
tually expofed, whilit fo important  
akeyto the commerce of the weltern  
ountry remained under foreign pow­  
¢. Difhculties too were prefenting  
semielves as to the navigation of other  
|freams, which, arifing within our  
[territorizs,pafs through thofe adjacent.  
Propofitions had therefore been au­  
thorifed for obtaining, on fair condi.  
ditions, the fovereignty of New-Or­  
leans, and of other pofleflions in that  
|quarter interelting to our quiet, to  
{uch extent as was deemed praltica­  
ble ; and the provifional appropriation  
of two millions of dollars, to be appli­  
ed and accounted for by the Prefident  
of the United States, intended as part  
of the price, was confidered as convey­  
ing the fantion of Congrefs to the ac­  
quifition prépofed. The enlightened  
government of France faw, with juft  
difcernment, the importance to both  
natiops of fuch liberal arrangements  
as might beft and permanently pro­  
mome peace, friendfhip and interefts  
of both : And the property and fo­  
ercignty of all Louifiana, which had  
been reltored to them, has, on certain  
conditions, been transferred to the U­  
nited States by inftruments bearing  
date the 3othof April lat. When  
thefe fhall iave received the conftitu.  
tional fan&amp;ion of the Senate, they  
will without delay, be.communicated  
to the Reprefentatives, alfo, for the  
exercife of their funétions as to thofe  
conditions which are within the pow­  
ers vefted by the Conftitution in Con­  
grefs. - Whilit the property and fove­  
reignty of the Mifli(ippl and its waters  
fecure an independent outlet for the  
produce of the weftern Statesyand an  
uncontroaled navigation through their  
wißle courfe, free from collifion with  
other powers, and the dangers to our  
peace from that fource, the fertility of  
the country, its climate and extent,  
promife, in due feafon, important aids  
to our treafure, an amzc provifion for  
our pofterity, and a wide fpread for the  
bleffings of freed om and equal laws.  
With the wifdom of Congrels it  
will reft to take thofe ulterior mea­  
fures whick may be neceflary for the  
  
immediate occupation, and tempora­  
’ry governmzant of the country ; for  
its incorporation into our union; for  
rendering the change of governm:at  
a blefiag to our newly adopted bre­  
thren ; for fecuring to them the rights  
}o( confcience and of proparty ; for  
confirming to the Indian inhabitants  
their occapancy and felf-governmeat,  
eltablithiny friendly and commercial  
relations with them, and for afcertain­  
ing the geography of the country ac­  
?uired. Such materials for your in­  
ormation relative to its affairs in gen­  
eral, as the thort fpace of time has per­  
mitted me to collect, will be laid be­  
fore you when the fubjet fhall be in  
a ftate for your confideration,  
Another important azquifition of  
territory has alfo been made, fince the  
laft feflion of Congrefs. The friend­  
ly tribe of Kafkafkia Indians, with  
which we have never had&#x27;a difference,  
reduced, by the wars and waats of  
favage life, to a few individuals, un.  
able to defend themfelves againft the  
neighboring tribes, has transferred its  
country to the United States, relerv­  
ing only for its members what is fuf­  
ficient to maintain them, in an agri­  
cultural way. The confiderations ftip­  
ulated are, that we fhall -extend to  
them our patronage and protection,  
and give them certain annual aids, in  
money, in implemeats of agriculture,  
&amp; other articles of their choice. This  
country, among the molt fertile with­  
in our limits, extending along the Mif­  
fifippi from the mouth of the Illinois  
to, and up, the Ohio, though not fo  
neceflary as a barrier, fince the acqui­  
fition J the other bank, may yet be  
well worthy of being laid open to im­  
mediate fettlement, as its inhabitants  
may delcend with rapidity in fupport  
of the lower country, fhould future  
circumftances expofe that to foreign  
enterprife. As the ftipulations, in this  
treaty alfo, involve matters within the  
competence of both Houles only, it  
will be laid before Congrefs fo foon as  
‘the Senate fhall have adviled its ratifi­  
cation. ;  
  
} With many of the other Indian  
tribes, improvements in agriculture &amp;  
houfe-hold manufature areadvancing;  
and, with all, our peace and friendfhip  
are eltablithed on grounds much firm­  
er than heretofore. The mealure a­  
dopted of eftablithing trading-houfcs  
among them and of furnithing them  
neceflaries in exchange for their com.-  
modities, at fuch moderate prices as  
leave no gain, but cover us from lofs,  
has the moft conciliatory and uleful  
effet on them, and is that which will  
beft fecure their peace and good will.  
The fmall veflels authorifed by Con.  
grefls, with a view to the Mediterrane­  
an fervice, have been fent into that  
fea 3 and will be able more effe&amp;ually  
to confine the Tripoline cruilers withs  
in their harbors, and fuperfede the ne­  
ceflity of convoy to our commerce in  
that quarter. They will fenfibly lef­  
fen the expences of that fervice the  
enfuing yeat.  
A Further knowledge of the ground  
in the north eaftern, and north weftern  
angles of the United States has evin­  
ced that the boundafies eftablithed by  
the treaty of Paris, between the Brit­  
ith territories and ours in thofe parts,  
were too imperfeétly defcribed to be  
fufceptible of execution. It has there­  
fore been thought worthy of attention,  
for preferving &amp; chcri(hin? the harmo­  
ny and ufeful intercourfe fubfifting be­  
tween the two nations, to remove by  
timely arrangements what unfavorable  
incidents might otherwife render a  
ground of future mifunderftanding. A  
convention has therefore been entered  
into, which provides for a pralicable  
demarcation of thofe limits, to the fa­  
tisfaltion of both parties.  
An account of the receipts and ex­  
penditures of the year ending the joth  
of September laft, with the eftimares  
for the fervice of the enfuing year,  
will be laid before you by the Secreta.  
ry of the Treafury, fo foon as the re­  
ceipts of the laft quarter fhall be re­  
turned from the more diftant States.  
It is alreadyafcertained that theamount  
paid into the treafury, for thut year,  
  
has been bet ween eleven and twelve  
millions of dollars, and that the reve.  
nue accrued during the fame term, ex.  
ceeds the fum counted on, as fuflicient  
for our current expences, and to ex­  
tinguith the public debt;, within the  
period heretofore propofed.  
  
The amount of debr paid, for the  
fame year, is about three millions one  
hundred thoufand dollars, exclufive of  
interelt, and making with the payment  
of the preceding year, a difcharge of  
more than ecight millions and an half  
of dollars of the principal of that debt,  
befides the accruing intereft : and there  
remain in the treafury nearly fix mil.  
lions of dollars, Of thefe, eight hun­  
dred and eighty thoufand have been  
referved for payment of, the firft in­  
ftalment due, under the Britifh Con­  
vention of January 8, 1802, and two  
millions are what have been before  
mentioned, as placed by Conggefs un.  
der the power and accountability of  
the Prefident, towards the price of  
New-Otleans and other territories ac­  
quired, which, temaining untouched,  
are ftill applicable to that obje&amp;t, and  
go in diminution of the fum to be fund­  
ed for it.  
  
Should the acquifition of Louifia­  
na be conftitutionally confirmed and  
carried into effect,d fum of nearly thir­  
teen millions of dollars will then be  
added to our public debt, moft of  
which is payabr:: after fifteen years ;

let it be our endeavor as it is our in­

with hofpitality from the diitreflss of

of annoyance to none ; to eftablifh in  
our harbors, fuch a police as may  
maintain law and order; to reftrain  
iour citizens from embarking individ­

takes no part; to punith feverely thof  
perfons, citizen or alien, who fhall  
ufurp the cover of our flag, for veflels  
not entitled to it, infecting thereby  
with fufpicion thofe of real Americans,  
and committing us into controverfies  
for the redrefs of wrongs not ourown;  
to exalt from every nation the obferv­

of thofe principles and pratices which  
all civilized people acknowledge ; to  
merit the character of a jult nation,  
and maintain that of an independent  
one, preferring every confequence to  
infult and habitual wrong. Congrefs  
will confider whether the exifting laws  
enable us efficacioully to maintain this  
courfe with our citizens in all places,  
and with others while within the lim­  
its of our jurifdition ; and will give  
them the new modifications neceflary  
for thefe objeéts. Some contraven­

&#x27; both within our &#x27;urifdi((iona’l limits,

difpofition of the govemments from  
whofe agents they have proceeded, as

juftice, leave us in reafonable expec­  
tation, that they will be re&amp;tified and  
prevented in future ; and that no aét  
will be countenanced by them which  
threatens to difturb our friendly inter­  
courfe. Separated by a wide ocean  
from the nations of Europe, and from  
the political interefts which entangle .  
them together with produétions and  
wants which render our commerce &amp;  
friendlhip ufeful to them, and theirs

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE,  
  
(Concluded. )  
  
ANOTHER important acquisition of  
territory has also been made since the last  
session of Congress. The friendly tribe of  
Kaskaskia Indians, with which we have  
never had a difference, reduced by the wars  
and wants of savage life, to a few individa-  
als unable to defend themselves against the  
neighbouring tribes, has transferred its  
country to the United States, reserving  
only for its members what is sufficient to  
maintain them inanagriculiuralway.

om  
the mouth of the Illinois, to, and up the  
Ohio, though not so necessary as a barrier,  
since the acquisition of the other bank, may  
yet be well worthy of being laid open to  
immediate settlement, as its inhabitants  
may descend with rapidity, in support of  
the lower country, should future circum-  
stances expose that to foreign enterprise.  
As the stipulations in this treaty, also in-  
volve matters -within the competence of  
both houses only, it will be laid before Con-  
gress so soon as the Senate shall have ad-  
vised its ratification.  
  
With many of the other Indian tribes,  
improvements in agriculture and household  
manufacture, are advancing; and with all  
our peace and friendship are established  
on grounds much firme: than heretofore,  
The measure adopted of establishing trad-  
ing houses among them, and of furnishing  
them necessaries in exchange for their  
commodities, at such moderate prices as  
leave no gain, but cover us from loss, has  
the most conciliatory and useful effect on  
them, and is that which will best secure  
their peace and good will.  
  
The small vessels authorised by Con-  
gress, witha view to the Mediterranean  
service, have been sent into that sea, and  
will be able more effectually to confine the  
Tripolitan cruisers within their harbours,  
  
and supercede the necessity of convoy to  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
our commerce in thatquarter. They will  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
mee  
  
  
  
  
  
  
rensibly lessen the expences of thai service  
the ensuing year.  
  
A further knowledge of the ground in the  
North Eastern and North Western angles  
of the United States, has evinced that the  
boundaries established by the treaty of Pa-  
ris, between the British territories and ours  
in those parts, were too imperfectly de-  
scribed to be susceptible of execution. It  
has therefore been thought worthy of atten-  
tion, for preserving and cherishing the har-  
mony and useful intercourse subsisting be-  
tween the two nations, to remove, by timely  
arrangements, what unfavourable incidents  
might otherwise render a ground of future  
misunderstanding. A convention has there-  
fure been entered into, which provides for  
a practicable demarcation of those limits to  
ihe satisfaction of both parties.  
  
An account of the receipts and expendi-  
tures of the year ending the 30th of Sep-  
tember last, with the estimates for the ser-  
vice of the ensuing year, will be laid be-  
fore you by the Secretary of the Treasury,  
as soon as the receipts of the last quarter  
shall be returned from the more distant  
states. It ts already ascertained that the  
amount paid into the treasury for that year  
has been between eleven and twelve mil-  
lions of dollars, and that the revenue, ac-  
crued during the same term, exceeds the  
sem counted on, and is sufficient for our cur-  
rent expences, and to extinguish the pub-  
lic debt, within the period heretofore pro-  
posed,  
  
The amount of debt paid, for the same  
year is about three millions one hundred  
thousand dollars, exclusive of interest, and  
making, with the payment of the preced-  
ing year, a discharge of more than eight  
imulions and a half of the principal of that  
debt, besides the accruing interest: and  
there remains in the treasury nearly six  
millions of dollars. Ofthese eight hundred  
and eighty thousand have been reserved  
tor the payment ofthe first enstalment due,  
under the British convention of January 8th,  
i802, and two millions are, what have  
been before mentioned, es placed by Con-  
gress under the power and accountability  
of the President, towards the price of New-  
Orleans and other ter-itories acquired;  
which, remaining untouched, are still ap-  
plicable to that object, and go in diminu-  
tion of the sum to be funded for it.  
  
Should the acquisition of Louisiana be  
constitutionally confirmed and carried into  
effect, a sum of nearly thirteen millions of  
dollars will then be added to our public  
cebt, most of which ts payable after fifteen  
years; before which term the present exist-  
it gdebts will all be discharged, by the es-  
  
  
  
tablished operations of the sinking fund.  
When we contemplate the ordinary, annu-  
al augmentation of impost from increasing  
population and wealth, the augmentation  
of the same revenue, by its extension to  
the new acquisition, and the economies  
which may still be introduced into our  
public expenditures, I cannot but hope  
that Congress, in reviewing their resources,  
will find means to meet the intermediate  
interest of this additional debt, without  
recurring to new taxes, and applying to  
this object only the ordinary progression  
ofourrevenue. Itsextraordinary increase,  
in times of foreign war, will be the proper  
and sufiicient fund for any measures of  
safety and precaution, which that state of  
things may render necessary in our neutral  
position,  
  
Remittances for the instalments of our  
foreign debt having been found practicable  
without loss, it has not been thought ex-  
pedient to use the power given by a for-  
mer act of Congress, of continuing them  
by reloans, and of redeeming, instead  
  
| thereuf, equal sums of domestic debt, al-  
  
  
  
though no difficulty was found in obtaining  
that accommodation.  
  
The sum of fifty thousand dollars, appro-  
priated by Congress for providing gun-  
boats, remains unexpended. The favour-  
able and peaceful turn of affairs, on the  
Mississippi, rendered an immediate execu-  
tion of that law unnecessary; and time  
was desirable, in order that the institution  
ofthat branch of our force might begin  
on models the most approved by experi-  
ence. The same issue of events dispens-  
ed with a resort to the application of a mil-  
lion and a half ofdollars, contemplated for  
purposes which were effected by happier  
means.  
  
We have seen with sincere concern the  
flames of war lighted up again in Europe,  
and nations with which we have the most  
friendly and useful relations, engaged in  
mutual destruction.— While we regret the  
miseries in which we see others involved,  
let us bow with gratitude to that kind Pro-  
vidence, which, inspiring with wisdom and  
moderation our late legislative councils,  
while placed under the urgency of the  
greatest wrongs, guarded us from hastily  
entering into the sanguinary contest, and  
left us only to look on and to pity its rava-  
ges. These will be heaviest on those im-  
mediately engaged; yet the nations pursu-  
ing peace will not be exempt from all evil.  
In the course of this conflict let it be our  
endeavour, as it is our interest and desire,  
to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent  
nations by every act of justice and of in-

sition of the gov-  
ernments from whose agents they have pro-  
ceeded, as well as their wisdom and regard  
for justice, leave us in reasonable expect-  
ation, that they will be rectified and pre-  
vented in future; and that no act will be  
countenanced by them which threatens to  
disturb our friendly intercourse.  
  
Separated by a wide ocean from the  
nations ot Europe, and from the political  
interests which entangle them togeher, with  
productions and wants which render our  
commerce and friendship useful to them  
and theirs to us, it cannot be the interest of  
any to assail us, nor ours to disturb them.  
We should be most unwise indeed, were we  
to cast away the singular blessings of the  
position in which nature has placed us, the  
opportunity she has endowed us with of  
pursuing, at a distance trom foreign conten-  
tions, the path of industry, peace, and hap-  
piness, of cultivating general friendship,  
and of bringing collisions of interest he  
umpirage of reason, rather than o €.  
How desirable then must it be, ina go-  
vernment like ours, to see its citizens adopt  
individually, the views, the interest, and  
the conduct which their country should  
pursue, divesting themselves of those pas-  
sions and partialities, which tend to lessen  
useful friendships, and to embarrass and  
embroil us in the calamitous scenes of Eu-  
rope.

dispositions, towards the observance of  
neutral conduct, that you will be sensible

laid before you when the fubjeS fliaii be  
in a {fate for your confidfcration.  
Another important acqitiu ion of terri­  
tory ha? alfo been made fnv:e the la ft fef­  
fion of Cong.efs. The friendly tribe of  
Kaikalkia Indians, with which we have  
never had a difference, reduced by the  
wars and wants of a favage life, to a few  
individuals unable to defeat! themfelves a­  
  
gaunt the neighboring tribes, has tram­  
ferred its country to the United States,  
rdcrving only for its members what is luf­  
ficient to maintain them in an agricultural  
way. rJ he confiderations flipulated are,  
that we iha!l extend to theui our pat­  
ronage and protection, and give them  
certain annual aids, in money, in imple­  
ments of agriculture, and other articles  
of their choice. -This country, among  
the mod fertile witkin our limits, extend­  
ing along the MiiTiifippi from the mouth  
of the Illinois to, and up the Ohio, tho*  
not fo neceffary as a barrier, ftnce the ac­  
quifion of the other bank may yet be well  
worthy of being laid open to immediate  
fettiemem, as its inhabitants may defcend  
with rapidity, *in fupport of the lower  
country, fhould future circitm fiances ex­  
pofe that to for ign enterptife. As the  
ilipulations, in this treaty alfo, involve  
matters‘within &#x27;the competence of both  
houfes onlv, it&#x27; will be laid before Con­  
grefs asfcon as the Senate mall haveadvi­  
led its ratification.  
With many of the other Indian tribes,  
imp love menu fe agriculture and houfe­  
hold manufacture, are advancing, and,  
with all, our peace and friend (hip are ef­  
tablifhed on grounds much firmer than  
heretofore. The meafure adopted ofef*  
tablUhing trading houfes among them,  
an^ of furniibiag them neceffaries in ex­  
change for their commodities, at fuch  
moderate prices a? leave no gain, Hut cov­  
er us from lofs, has the moil conciliatory  
and ufcful &#x27;effect oil them,, and is that  
which will but fecure their peace and  
good will. *.:  
The final! veffcls autherifed bv Con­  
J  
grefs, with a view to the Mediterranean  
fervice. have been fent into that fea j and  
will be able Qiore effectually to confine the  
Tripoline cruifers within their harbours  
‘and fupercede the neceflity of convoy to  
our commerce in that quarter; &#x27;-They  
will fenfibly lsues the expellees of that Ter­  
vice the enfuing year. « u *  
A further knowledge of the.j^tfbuTid in ,  
the north euiderti, and north \vt3ern an­  
gles of the United States, has evinced *  
that the boundaries effablifhed by the trea­  
ty1 of Paris, between the Lritifh territories  
and our? in thOfe parts, were too imperfeCt­  
ly deferibed to be fufeeptibie of execution.  
It has therefore been thought, worthy of |  
attention, for preferving &amp; cheriihing the !  
harmony and ufeful intercourfe fubfifting  
between the twd nations, to remove by  
timely arrangement&#x27;s what unfavorable  
incidents might otherwife render a ground  
of future mifundedtanding*. •• A conven­  
tion has therefore been entered into,,  
which provides for a&#x27; practicable deinark­  
ation of thofe limits, to the fatisiaClion of  
both parties. t&#x27; ; &#x27;  
  
An account ct tne receipts ana expenai­  
tures of the year ending the 30th of Sep­  
tember laft, with the eflimates tor the fer­  
vice of the enfuing year, will be bid be­  
fore you by the Secretary of the Treasury  
fo foon as the receipts of the lad qtartfer  
(hall be returned from the more diitant  
dates. - It is already afeertbnsd- that the  
amount paid into the creafury, for that  
year, has been between eleven&#x27;and tTVelvq  
millions of dollars, and that the revenue  
accrued duringthefame term&#x27;, exceeds the  
lum counted on, as fufBcient for our cur­  
rent expenccs; and to extinguish the pub­  
lic debt, within the period-heretofbre pro­  
J , ■ C  
The amount of debt paid,  
fam&amp;^ear, is about three  
hutdred  
  
intereft, and making, with the payment  
of the preceding* year, a discharge of  
more than eight millions and an half of  
dollars of the principal of that debt, be­  
fides the accruing interefl ; and there  
remain in the Treasury nearly I t mil­  
lions of dollars. Of thefe, eight hun­  
dred and eighty thoufand have been re­  
ferved for the payment of the firfl in­  
lialment due, under the Britifh Conven­  
tion of January 8, 1802, and two mil­  
lions are, what have been before men­  
tioned, as placed by Congrefs under the  
power and accountability of the Prefi­  
dent, towards the m-ice of New-Orieans  
and other territories acquired, which,  
remaining untouched, are Itill applica­  
ble to&#x27;that objeft, and go in diminution  
  
ox tne lum to be iundeu tor it.  
Should the acquifirion of Louifiana  
be conllitiitidnaily confirmed and car­  
ried into effect ,a fum of nearly thirteen  
millions of dollars will then be -added  
to our public debt, molt of which is  
payable after fifteen years ; before  
which term the prefent exiltrng debts  
will all be difeharged, by the eftablifhed  
operation of the finking fund. When  
we contemplate the ordinary, annual  
augmentation of impofts from increaf­  
ing population and wealth, the aug­  
mentation of the fame revenue, by ih  
extenfion to the new acquifition, and  
&#x27;the economics which may Hill be intro­  
duced into our public expenditures, I  
cannot but hope that Congrefs, in re­  
viewing their refources, will find means  
to meet the intermediate interefl of this  
additional debt, without recurring to  
new taxes, and applying to this objedt  
only the ordinary progrefiion of cur  
revenue. Its extraordinary increafe, in  
tirhes of foreign war, will be the proper  
and fufRcient fund for any meafures of  
fafety or precaution, which that (fate of  
things may render neceffary in our  
neutral pofition..  
Remittances for the inlfalments of  
our foreign debt having Deen found  
practicable without lofs, it has not been  
thought expedient to ufe the power,  
given by a former a£t of Congrefi*, of  
continuing them by reloarisj and of re­  
deeming, ipftead thereof, equal films of  
domeftic debt, although no difficulty  
was found in obtaining that accomoda­  
tion.  
The fum of thoufand dollars, ap­  
propriated by Congrefs for providing  
gun-boats, remains unexpended. * The  
•favorable and peaceabte turn of affair’s  
oh the Miffifippi, rendered an immedi­  
ate execution of that law unneCefiary ;  
and time was defirable, in order that  
the - inftitution of that branch of our  
force might begin on models * the moft  
approved by experience. The farhe  
iffue of events difpenfed with&#x27; a refort to  
the appropriation of,a million .and an  
half of dollars, contemplated for pur­  
pofes which were effected by happier

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the U}iz‘ed States : |  
IN calling you together, fellow-citizens, at an carlier day !  
“than was contemplated by the a&amp; of the laft#fion of Con- ’  
grefs, I have not been insensible to the personal Incom*eni&amp;cieéi*%  
neceflarily resulting- from an unexpected change in your ars |  
rangements but matters of great public concernment have ren- |  
dered this call neceflary ; and the intereffs you feel in these |  
will fupercede in your minds all private confiderttions. |  
Congress witnefled, at their last feflion, the extraordinary g  
agitation produced in the public mind by the {fufpenfion of our |  
right of deposit, at the port of New-Orleans, no aflignment of |  
another place having been made according to trzaty. &#x27;Fhey |  
were sensible that the continuance of that privation would be ?  
more injurious te our nation, than any consequences which |  
could flow from any mode of redress. But reposing just con- |  
fidence in the good faith of the goveérnment whose oﬁzicer had !  
committed the wrong, friendly and reafoudble representations !  
were resorted to, and the right of deposit was restored. , ’  
Previous however to this period, we had not been unaware |  
of the danger to which our peace would be perpetually expos­  
ed, whilst {o important a key to the commerce of the weltern i  
country remained under foreign power. Difliculties too were |  
presenting themselves as to the navigation of ether fireams,  
which, arising within our territories, pass through thole adja­  
cent. Propofitionshad therefore been authorifed for obtaining, i  
on fair conditions, the fovercignty of New-Orleans, and of o- |  
ther poffeflions in that quarter interesting to our quiet, to such §  
extent as was deemed practicable ; and the provisional appro- }  
priation of two millions of dollars, to be applied and account- |  
ed for by the President of the United States, mntended as part (  
of the price, was considered as conveying the sanction of Con­  
gress to the acquisition proposed.. The enlightened governs- ’

and ample provision for our posterity, and a wide spread for  
the bleflings of freedom and equal laws.  
With the wisdom of Congress it will relt to take those ulterior measures |  
which may bé necessary for the immediate occupation, and temporary govern­  
ment of the country ; for its in‘corporation into our union ; for rendering the  
change of government a blefling to our newly adopted brethern ; for securing  
to them the rights of conscience and of property ; for confirming to the Indian  
inhabitants their occupancy and felf-government, eftablithing friendly and com. !

Another important acquisition of territory has also been made  
since the last feflion of Congress. The friendly tribe of Kafkai- ’  
kia Indians, with which we have never had a difference, redu­  
ced by the wars and wants of savage life, to a few individuals t  
unable to defend themselves againit the neighbouring &#x27; tribes, !  
has transferred its country to the United States, reserving on­  
ly for its members what is fufficient to maintain them inan a­  
gricultural way. The considerations stipulated are, that we  
shall extend to them our patronage and protection, and give 1  
them certain annual aids, in money, in implements of agricul­  
ture, and other articles of their choice, Thiscountry,among  
the most fertile within our limits, tending along the Miffifippi

A further knowledge of the ground in the North Eastern, and North Western  
angles of the United States, has evinced that:the boundaries eftablithed by the  
treaty of Paris, between the Britith territories and ours in those parts, wére too  
imperfedtly described to be susceptible of execution. It has therefore be¢n tho&#x27;t

~ An aecount of the receipts and expenditufes of the year ending the 30th of  
September last, with the eltimates of th= service. of the.enfuing year, will be  
laid before you by the Secretary of the Treafary, so soon as the receipts of  
the lalt quarter shall be returned fromi the more distant Rates. It is already  
ascertained that the amount paid into the treasury, for that year, has been be­  
tween cieven and twelve millions of dollars, and thdt the révenue, accrued  
‘during the {ame term, exceeds the sum counted on, as fufficient for our cur­  
rent expences, and to extinguish the public debt, within the psriod heretofore

The amount of debt paid, for the fame year, is about three millions one

dollars of the principal of that debt, besides the accruing interelt ; and there  
temains in the treasury, nearly {ix millions of dollars. Of these eight hun­  
dred and eighty thoufund have been reserved for payment of the&#x27; firlt inftal­  
ment due, under the Britith convention of January Bth, 1802, and two mil­  
lions are, what have been before rr’ntioned, as placed by Congre(s under the  
power and accountability of the President, towards the price of New-Orleans  
and other territories acquired, which, remaining untouched, are fill applicable  
to that objed, and go in diminution of the sum to be funded for it.  
Should the acquisition of Louisiana be constitutionally confirmed and carried  
‘into effe&amp;, a sum of nearly thirteen millions of dollars will then be added to  
our public debt, most of which is payable dfter fifteen years ; before which  
term the present exilling debts will all be discharged, by the established operas.  
tion of the finking fund. When we contemplate the ordinary, annual aug­  
mentation of impolt fromincreafing population and wealth, the augmentation  
of the fame revenue, by its extention to the new acquisition, and the econo­  
mies which may still be introduced into cur public etpenditures, I ¢annot but  
hope that Congress, in reviewing their resources, will find means to meet the  
intermediate interest of this additional debt, without recurring to new taxes,  
and applying to-this abject only the ordinary progrefiion of our revenue. Itsex­  
traordinary increase, in times of foreign war, will be the proper ahd {ufficient  
fund for any measure of fafety or precaution,which that state of things may rens  
der necessary in our neutral pofiticn. ! . &amp; ‘  
Remittances for the inftalment of our foreign debt having been found pra&amp;i­  
cable without loss, it has not been thought expedient to use the power given by  
a former a&amp; of Congress, of continning them by reloans, and of redeeming, in­  
stead thereof, equal sums of domestic debt, although no difiiculty was found in  
obtaining that accommodation. , -~ ’ ‘  
‘The sum of fifty thousand dollars, appropriated by Congrels for providing  
gun-boats, remains unexpended. The favourable and peaceable turn of affairs  
on the Mifliflippt, rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary ;  
and time was desirable, in order that the infQtitution of that branch of our  
force might begin on models the most approved by experience. - The fame  
issue of events dispensed with a resort to the appropriztion of 4 millicn and  
half of dolls. contemplated for purposes which were cffedted by happier  
means. : ot }  
We have seen with sincere concern the Hames of war lighted up again in  
Europe, and nations, with which we have the toft friendly and ufetul rela­  
tions, engaged in mutual deftru&amp;ion: While we regret the miseries in which  
we fee orhers-involved, let us bow with gratitude to that kind Providence,  
which, inspiring with wisdom and moderation our late legislative councils,  
while placed under the urgency of the greatelt wrongs, gvarded us from hal~  
tily entering into the funguinary contelt, and ieft us.“only to look on and pity  
its ravages. - These will be heavielt on those immedrargiy engaged ; yet the  
nations pursuing peace will not be exempt from all evil. In the course of  
this confli&amp; let it be our endavour, as it-is-aur interelt and desire, to chiltivate  
the friendthip of the belligerent nations by every act of jultice and of innocent  
kindness ; to receive their armed veflels, with hofpitaiicy, from the dittrefles  
of the sea, bat to admiaifter the means of annoyance to none ; to establish in  
our harbors, such a police as may maintain law and order ; to restrain our ¢ja  
tizens from embarking individuelly in a war in which their country takes no,  
part ;to punish féverely those persons, citizen or alien, who shall usurp the  
cover of our flag, for veflels not entitled to it, infedting thereby with {ufpicion

To the Sexate and House of Representatives  
  
of ihe United Siates,—In calling you togethe r,  
fellow citizens, at an eariier day than wes con-  
templated by the act of the last session of Con-  
gtess, 1 have not been insensible to the personal  
Moonveniencies pecessarily resulting from an  
woexpected change in your arrangements ;  
but matters of great public concerament have  
  
rendered this ca&#x27;l necessary ; and the interests  
  
you feel m these will supercede in your minds  
all private considerations.———Congress witness-  
ed, in their late session, the extraordinary agi-  
Yation produced in the public mind, by the sus-  
  
press of our rivht of deposit at the port of  
  
New- Orleans, no assignment of enother place  
having been made according to treaty. They  
were sénsible that the continuance of their pri-  
vation would be more injurious to ovr nation,  
  
tan any conscquences which could flow from  
  
any mode of redress. Bur reposing just conft-  
  
dence in the good faith of the government  
whose officer had committed the wrong, friend-  
ly and reasonabie representations were resorted  
to, amd the right of deposit was restored.——  
Previous, however, to this period, we had nor  
  
been unaware of the danger to which our peace  
  
wvould be perpetually exposed, whilst so impor-  
tant a key to the commerce of the western coun-  
try remained under foreign power. Difficulties  
90 were presenting themselves as to the navi-  
gation of other streams, which, arising within  
our territories, pess through those adjacent.  
Propositions had therefore been authorized for  
‘obtaining, on fair conditions, the sovercixnty of  
New-Orleans, and of other possessions in that  
quarter interesting to our quiet, to such extent  
as was deemed practicable ; and the provisional  
appropriation of two millions of dollars, to be  
applied and accounted for by the President of  
part of the  
price, was considered as conveying the sanction  
of Congress to the acquisition proposed. The  
enlight-ned government of France saw, with  
just discernment, the importance of

portant acquisition of territory has also beer  
made, since the Inst session of Congress. The  
friendly tribe of Kaskaskia, Indians, with whi!  
we have never had a difference, reduced, by the  
wars and wants of savage life, to a few Indiv  
  
duals unable to defend themselves agarmst the  
neighbouring tribes, has transferred its country  
to the Unired States, reserving only for 1  
  
members what is sufficient to maintain them,  
an agricultural way. The considerations supu-  
lated are, that we shall extend to them our pa-  
tronage and protection, and give them certain  
annual aids, in money, in implements of agri-  
culture, and other articles of their choice. 17 his  
country, among the most fertile within od  
limits, extending along the Mississipp! from ong  
mouth of the Illinois, to and up the Onio,  
though not so necessary as a barrier, since tie  
acquisition of the other bank, may yet be weil  
worthy of being laid open to immediate sette-

able more effectually to confine the  
  
Tripoline cruisers within their harbours, and

the United Stares, has evinced that che bounda-  
rics established by the treaty of peace, between  
the British territories and ours in those parts,  
vere COO imperfectly described to be susceptible  
of execution. It has therefore been thought  
rthy of attention, for preserviny and cherish-  
the harmony and useful intercourse subsist-  
  
ing between the two nations, to remove, by  
timely arrangements, what unfavourable inci-  
dents might otherwise render a ground of future  
misunderstanding. A convention has therefore  
been entered into, which provides for a practi-  
cable demarcation of those limits, to the :satis-  
faction of both parties.—-—-An account of the re-  
ccipts and expenditures of the year ending the  
‘h of September last, with the estimates for  
the service of the ensuing year, will be laid be-  
re you by the Secretary of the Treasury, so  
soon «s the receipts of the last quarter shail be  
returned from the more distant states. It is  
already ascertained, that the amount paid into  
the treasury, for that year, has been between  
eicven and twelve millions of dollars, and that  
the revenue, accrued during the same term,  
exceeds the sum counted on, as sufficient for  
our current expenses, and to extinguish the  
Puovc dedt, within the period heretofore pro-  
poscd.—e—The amount of debt paid for the

thousand dollars, exclusive of interest, and mak-

tion of the same revenue, by its extension to the  
new acquisition, and the economies which! may  
still be introduced into our public expenditures,  
I cannot bur hope that Congress, in reviewing  
their resources will find means to meet the in-  
termediate interest of this additional debt, with.  
out recurring to new taxes, and applying to this  
object only the orcinary progression of oar reves  
nue. Its extraordinary increase, in times of fo-  
reign war, will be the proper and sufhcient fund  
for any measures of safety or precaution, which  
that state of things may render necessary in our  
neutral position.——Remittances for the instal-  
ments of our foreign debt having been found  
practicable without loss it has not been thoughe  
expedient to use the power, given by a former  
act of Congress, of continuing them by reloans,  
and of redeeming, instead thereof, equal sums  
of domestic debt, although no dificu.ty was  
found in obtaining that accommodation.——T he  
sum of fifty thousand dollars, appropriated by  
Congress for providing gun-boats, remains un-  
expended, The favourable and peaceable turn  
of affairs on the Mississippi, rendered an imme-  
diite execution of that law unnecessary; and  
time was desirable, in order that the institution  
of that branch of our force might begin on mo-  
dels the most approved by experience. The  
same issue of events dispensed with a resort to  
the appropriation of a miilion and an half of  
dollars, contemplated for purposes which were  
effected by happier means.——We have seen  
with sincere concern the flames of war lighted  
up again in Europe, aad nations with which we  
have the most friendly and useful relations, en-  
giged in mutual destruction. While we regret  
the miseries in which we see others involved, let  
us bow with gratitude to that kind Providence,  
which inspiring with wisdom and moderation  
our late legislative councils, while placed under  
the urgency of the greatest’wronys, guarded us  
from hastily entering into the sanvuinary con-  
test, and left us only to look on and to pity its  
ravages. These will be heaviest on those im-  
mediately engaged; yet the nativns pursuing  
peace will not be exempt from all evil. In the  
course of this conflict let ‘t be our endeavour, as  
it is our interest and desire, to cultivate the  
friendship of the belligerent nations by every  
act of justice and of innocent kindness; to re-  
ceive their armed vessels with hospitality from  
the distresses of the sea, but to administer the  
means of annoyance to none; to establish in ouc  
harbours, such a police as may maintain law  
and order; to restrain our citizens from em-  
barking individually in a war in which their  
country takes no part;

sition of the govern-  
ments from whose agents they have proceeded,  
as well as their wisdom and regard for justice,  
Jeave us in reasonable expectation, that they  
will be rectified and prevented in future ; and  
thar no act wiil be countenanced by them which  
threatens to disturb our friendly intercourse.  
Separated by a wide ocean from the nations of  
Europe, and froin the political interests which  
entangle them together, with productions and  
wants which render our commerce and fri nd-  
ship useful to them, and theifs to us, it cannot  
be the interest of any to assail us, nor ours to  
disturb them. We should be most unwise in-  
deed were we to cast away the singular blessings  
of the position in which nature has placed us,  
the opportunity she has endowed us with of  
pursuing, at a distance from foreign conten-  
tions, the paths of industry, peace, and happi-  
ness, of cultivating general friendship, and of  
bringing collisions of interest to the umpirage  
of reason, rather than of force. How desirapie  
then must it be, in a government like ours, to  
See its citizens adopt individually the views, the  
interests, and the conduct which their country  
should pursue, divesting theinselves of those  
pessions and partialities which tead to lessen  
useful friendships, and to embarrass and embroil  
us in the calamitous scene of Europe. Con-  
tident, fellow citizens, that you will duly esti-  
mate the importance of neutral d spositions to-  
wards the observance of neutral conduct, that  
you will be sen ible how much it is our duty to  
look on the bloody Arena spread before us,  
with commiseration indeed, but with no other  
wish than to see irclosed, am persuaded you  
will cordially cherish these dispositions, in’ all  
discussions among yourselves, and in all cor-  
Muaications with your constituents. And I an-  
ticipate with satisfaction the measures of wis-  
dom, which the great interests now committed  
to you, will give _yow an opportunity of provid-
