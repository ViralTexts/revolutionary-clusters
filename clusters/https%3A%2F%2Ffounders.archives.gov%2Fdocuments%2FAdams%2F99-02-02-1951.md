the necessary appropriations, the action of the President  
and the Senate in the ratification of the treaty. The action  
of the House was, in due time, found to be in favor of the  
treaty,—and the threatened consequence from the French

delay be notified, that the flag of the French republic will  
treat neutral vessels, as to confiscations, searches or capture, in the  
same manner as they shall suffer the English to treat them.  
By this decree, a vital article of the treaty of ’78 was  
abrogated by the French government ; and the effect imme-  
diately, and necessarily was, to place the French republic in a  
state of guasi war with the United States.

either of the said parties.” (It will be seen that this expressly contra-  
vened the terms of our treaty with France.) The French wrath arose. The  
Directory refused to receive Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, sent by our Gov-  
ernment as minister to France, in place of James Monrve, and by one decree  
after another turned her cruisers loose upon our commerce.

France, had seized American vessels and their cargoes—to the number of 478  
—on their way to French ports. In July of 1795 France declared that “the  
French republic will treat neutral vessels, either as to confiscation, searches,  
or capture, in the same manner as they shall suffer the English to treat them.
