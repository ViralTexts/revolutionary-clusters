I should rejoice in the prolongation of my life for another year, were it only for the pleasure of seeing and embracing so many of my Friends.—  
As every Gentleman here is at least as independent of me, as I can pretend to be of him; as there is no imaginable motive of hope Apprehension or any Sinister or private Interest, which could have prompted you, to such a manifestation of your friendly Sentiments: I am fully assured that this Visit is the Result of Feeling and not of Ceremony.—  
The Performance of the Parts which were cast to me, in the Course of the Revolution, though the Scenes were in the Secret Conclave of a Congress with out Galleries and with closed doors, or at a thousand League distance beyond Seas, and the few Spectators and Witnesses are almost all dead, I shall leave to the Candor of the public and the Judgment of Posterity with Such traditionary Sight as they may possess.—  
After as carefull a Review as I am capable of taking of the civil Administration, during the Period when I was President of the United States, I see nothing of any Consequence to repent or regrett. Some measures were the Effect of imperious neccessity, much against my Inclinations. Others were the Measures of the Legislature, which altho approved when passed, were never previously proposed or reccommended by me. Some of them, left to my discretion were never executed, because no neccessity for them, in my Judgment ever occured. I shall say no more, upon this Subject at present, but this; we were emancipated from two burthensom yokes, the French Treaty and consular Convention which were grevious to us, and would have been intollerable to our Children. The Nation in future, unshackled with positive Stipulation, would have only to consider, her Duties to foreign Powers by the Law of Nations, and to estimate her Interest by an honest and impartial Policy—  
Let me add one observation more; Under the Continual provocations, breaking and pouring in upon me from unexpected as well as expected quarters, during the two last years of my Administration, he must have been more of a modern Epicurean Phylosopher, than I ever was or ever will be, to have born them all, without some incautious expressions at times of an inutterable Indignation. I have no other Apology to make to Individuals or the Public.—  
The Prospect of National Greatness is as Sure and certain as that of National Existance. The Union is our Rock of Safety as well as our Pledge of Grandeur. And for this reason I hesitate not to recommend to you as a Sentiment—&quot;A Union of honest Men.&quot;  
I wish you Gentlemen, for the day and for your Lives all the honest Joys and Felicities, which you can possibly wish for yourselves—

The performance of the pxrts which were

jrA at prefent, but this, we were emancipa­  
ted from two burthenfome yokes, the French  
Treaty ana Coniular Convention, which were  
gritvoui to us, and would have been into’er- 1

i.nflnckled with politive fbpulatiooa, will  
have only to conlider her du&#x27;ics to foreign

_ I should rejoice in the prolongation of  
my life for another year, were it only for  
the pleasure of seeing and embracing so  
many of my friends.  
As every gentleman here is at least as  
independent of me, as I can pretend to be  
of hzm ; as there is no imaginable motive  
of hope, apprehension, or any smister or  
private interest, which, could have prompt­  
ed you to a manisestation of your friendly  
sentimEnts, I am fully assured that this  
,vilit is the result of feeling and not of one  
mony. ss  
The persorssmance of the parts which  
were castto me, in the course of the reVo­  
lution, though the scenes were in the secret  
conclave of a congress, without galleries  
and with closed doors, or at a thousand  
leagues distance beyond the seas, and the  
si sew spectators or witness-es are almost all  
dead, I shall leave to the candour of the  
public, &amp; the judgment of posterity, with  
such traditionary lights as they may pos.  
sess.  
After as careful a review as I am casspa­  
ble of taking of the civil administration,  
during the period when I was Prefident of  
the United States, I see nothing of any  
consequence to repent or regret. Some  
measures were the eﬀect of imperious ne.  
ceffity, much against my inclinations.  
Others were measures of the legiﬂature,  
which, altho&#x27; approved when pulled, were  
never previously proposed or recommended  
by me. Some of them, lest to my discre­  
tion, were never executed, because no ne­  
_cellity for them, in my judgment, ever oc.  
ctured. I shall say no more upon this sub­  
ject at present, but this, we were eman.  
cipated from two burthensome yokes, the  
&quot;French treaty and si. consular convention,  
which were grievous to us, and would have  
&#x27;been intolerable to our children. The  
j&#x27;nation in sutore, unshackled with positive  
stipulations, will have only to consider her  
duries to sovereign powers by the law of  
nations, and to csiimate her interest by an  
honest and impartial policy.  
Let me add one observation more.—  
ctUnder the continual provocation, breaking  
and pouring in upon me from unexpected  
as well as expected quarters, during the  
&#x27;—two last years of my administration, he
