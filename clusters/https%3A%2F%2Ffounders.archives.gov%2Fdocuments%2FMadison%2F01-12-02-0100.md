Mr. Madison. I cannot concur with gentlemen who think the present an improper time or place to enter into a discussion of the proposed motion; if it is taken up in a seperate view, we shall do the same thing at a greater expence of time. But the gentleman says that it is improper to connect the two objects, because they do not come within the title of the bill; but this objection may be obviated by accomodating the title to the contents; there may be some inconsistency in combining the ideas which gentlemen have expressed, that is, considering the human race as a species of property; but the evil does not arise from adopting the clause now proposed; it is from the importation to which it relates. Our object in enumerating persons on paper with merchandize, is to prevent the practice of actually treating them as such, by having them in future, forming part of the cargoes of goods, wares, and merchandize to be imported into the United States, the motion is calculated to avoid the very evil intimated by the gentleman.  
It has been said that this tax will be partial and oppressive; but suppose a fair view is taken of this subject, I think we may form a different conclusion. But if it be partial or oppressive, are there not many instances in which we have laid taxes of this nature? Yet are they not thought to be justified by national policy? If any article is warranted on this account, how much more are we authorised to proceed on this occasion? The dictates of humanity, the principles of the people, the national safety and happiness, and prudent policy requires it of us; the constitution has particularly called our attention to it—and of all the articles contained in the bill before us, this is one of the last I should be willing to make a concession upon so far as I was at liberty to go, according to the terms of the constitution or principles of justice—I would not have it understood that my zeal would carry me to disobey the inviolable commands of either.  
I understood it had been intimated, that the motion was inconsistent or unconstitutional. I believe, sir, my worthy colleague has formed the words with a particular reference to the constitution; any how, so far as the duty is expressed, it perfectly accords with that instrument; if there are any inconsistencies in it, they may be rectified; I believe the intention is well understood, but I am far from supposing the diction improper. If the description of the persons does not accord with the ideas of the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jackson) and his idea is a proper one for the committee to adopt, I see no difficulty in changing the phraseology.  
I conceive the constitution in this particular, was formed in order that the government, whilst it was restrained from laying a total prohibition, might be able to give some testimony of the sense of America, with respect to the African trade. We have liberty to impose a tax or duty upon the importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit; and this liberty was granted, I presume, upon two considerations—the first was, that until the time arrived when they might abolish the importation of slaves, they might have an opportunity of evidencing their sentiments, on the policy and humanity of such a trade; the other was that they might be taxed in due proportion with other articles imported; for if the possessor will consider them as property, of course they are of value, and ought to be paid for. If gentlemen are apprehensive of oppression from the weight of the tax, let them make an estimate of its proportion, and they will find that it very little exceeds five per cent. ad valorem, so that they will gain very little by having them thrown into that mass of articles, whilst by selecting them in the manner proposed, we shall fulfil the prevailing expectation of our fellow citizens, and perform our duty in executing the purposes of the constitution. It is to be hoped, that by expressing a national disapprobation of this trade, we may destroy it, and save ourselves from reproaches, and our posterity the imbecility ever attendant on a country filled with slaves.  
I do not wish to say any thing harsh, to the hearing of gentlemen who entertain different sentiments from me, or different sentiments from those I represent; but if there is any one point in which it is clearly the policy of this nation, so far as we constitutionally can, to vary the practice obtaining under some of the state governments it is this; but it is certain a majority of the states are opposed to this practice; therefore, upon principle, we ought to discountenance it as far as is in our power.  
If I was not afraid of being told that the representatives of the several states, are the best able to judge of what is proper and conducive to their particular prosperity, I should venture to say that it is as much the interest of Georgia and South Carolina, as of any in the union. Every addition they receive to their number of slaves, tends to weaken them and renders them less capable of self defence; in case of hostilities with foreign nations, they will be the means of inviting attack instead of repelling invasion. It is a necessary duty of the general government to protect every part of the empire against danger, as well internal as external; every thing therefore which tends to encrease this danger, though it may be a local affair, yet if it involves national expence or safety, becomes of concern to every part of the union, and is a proper subject for the consideration of those charged with the general administration of the government. I hope in making these observations, I shall not be understood to mean that a proper attention ought not to be paid to the local opinions and circumstances of any part of the United States, or that the particular representatives are not best able to judge of the sense of their immediate constituents.  
If we examine the proposed measure, by the agreement there is between it, and the existing state laws, it will shew us that it is patronized by a very respectable part of the union. I am informed that South-Carolina has prohibited the importation of slaves, for several years yet to come; we have the satisfaction then of reflecting that we do nothing more than their own laws do at this moment. This is not the case with one state. I am sorry that her situation is such as to seem to require a population of this nature, but it is impossible in the nature of things, to consult the national good without doing what we do not wish to do, to some particular part.  
Perhaps gentlemen contend against the introduction of the clause, on too slight grounds. If it does not comport with the title of the bill, alter the latter. If it does not conform to the precise terms of the constitution amend it. But if it will tend to delay the whole bill, that perhaps will be the best reason for making it the object of a separate one. If this is the sense of the committee I shall submit

To show that Congress can abolish slavery in the District, under the  
grant of power “to provide for the common defence and to promote  
the general welfare,” 1 quote an extract from a speech of Mr. Madison,  
of Va., in the first Congress under the constitution, May 18, 1789.  
Speaking of the abolition of the slave trade, Mr. Madison says: “I  
should venture to say it is as much for the interests of Georgia and South  
Carolina, as of any state in the union. Every addition they receive to  
their number of slaves tends to weaken them, and renders them less

they will be the means of inviting attack instead of repelling invasion.  
It is a necessary duty of the general government to protect every part of  
the empire against danger, as well internal as external. Every thing,  
therefore, which tends to increase this danger, though it may be a local affair,  
yet if it involves national expense or safety, it becomes of concern to every  
part of the union, and is a proper sulject for the consideration of those

We hold with Mr. Madison, that under the  
clause of the constitution, which authorizes  
Congress to ‘provide for the common defence  
and promote the general welfare,” that body  
possesses power to abolish slavery in the sever-  
al States. ‘That patriotic Statesman, a_ slave-  
holder himself, and termed by the country at  
large, “the Father of the Constitution,’ used  
the following unequivocal language, in the first  
Congress under the Constitution May 13th 17-

Mr. Madison, (of Va.) I cannot concur with gentlemen who think  
the present an improper time or place to enter into a discussion of  
the proposed motion; if it is taken up in a separate view, we shall do  
the same thing at a greater expense of time. But the gentlemen say  
that it is improper to connect the two objects, because they do not  
come within the title of the bill. But this objection may be obviated by  
accommodating the title to the contents; there may be some incon-  
sistency in combining the ideas which gentlemen have expressed,  
that is, considering the human race as a species of property ; but the  
evil does not arise from adopting the clanse now proposed, it is from  
the imvortation to which it relates. Our object in enumerating  
persons on paper with merchandise, is to prevent the practice of actu-  
ally treating them as such, by having them, in future, forming part of  
the cargoes of goods, wares, aud merchandise to be imperted into the  
United States. The motion is calculated to avoid the very evil intimated  
by the gentleman. It has been said that this tax will be partial and  
oppressive: but suppose a fair view is taken of this subject, I think  
we may form a different conclusion. But if it be partial or oppres

sive, are there not many instances in which we have laid taxes of this  
nature? Yet are they not thought to be justified by national policy ?  
If any article is warranted on this account, how much more are we  
authorized to proceed on this occasion ? The dictates of humanity,  
the principles of the people, the national safety and happiness, and  
prudent policy requires it of us; the constitution bas particularly  
called our attention to it — and of all the articles contained in the bill  
before us, this is one of the last I should be willing to make a con-  
cession upon so far as I was at liberty to go, according to the terms  
of the constitution or principles of justice —I would not have it  
understood that my zeal would carry me to disobey the inviolable  
commands of either.  
  
I understood it had been intimated, that the motion was inconsis-  
tent or unconstitutional. I believe, sir, my worthy colleague has formed  
the words with a particular reference to the constitution ; any how, so  
far as the duty is expressed, it perfectly accords with that instrument ;  
if there are any inconsistencies in it, they may be rectified; I believe  
the intention is well understood, but I am tar from supposing the  
diction improper. If the description of the persons does not accord  
with the ideas of the gentleman from Georgia, (Mr. Jackson,) and his  
idea is a proper one for the committee to adopt, I see no difficulty in  
changing the phraseology.  
  
1 conceive the constitution, in this particular, was formed in order  
that the government, whilst it was restrained from laying a total  
prohibition, might be able to give some testimony of the sense of  
America, with respect to the African trade. We have liberty to im-  
pose a tax or duty upon the importation of such persons as any of  
the States now existing shall think proper to admit; and this liberty  
was granted, I presume, upon two considerations — the first was, that  
until the time arrived when they might abolish the importation of  
slaves, they might have an opportunity of evidencing their sentiments,  
on the policy and humanity of such a trade ; the other was that they  
might be taxed in due proportion with other articles imported ; for if  
the possessor will consider them as property, of course they are of  
value and ought to be paid for. If gentlemen are apprehensive of  
oppression from the weight of the tax, let them make an estimate of  
its proportion, and they will find that it very litthe exceeds five per  
cent, ad valorem, so that they will gain very little by having them  
thrown into that mass of articles, whilst by selecting them in the  
manner proposed, we shall fulfil the prevailing expectation of our  
fellow citizens, and perform our duty in executing the purposes of  
the constitution. It is to be hoped that by expressing a national dis-  
approbation of this trade, we may destroy it, and save ourselves from  
reproaches, and our posterity the imbecility ever attendant on a country  
filled with slaves.  
  
Ido not wish to say any thing harsh, to the hearing of gentlemen  
who entertain different sentiments from me, or different sentiments  
from those I represent; but if there is any one point in which it is

clearly the policy of this nation, so far as we constitutionally can, to  
vary the practice obtaining under some of the State governments, it is  
this; but it is certain a majority of the States are opposed to this  
practice, therefore, upon principle, we ought to discountenance it as  
far as is in our power.  
  
If 1 was not afraid of being told that the representatives of the sev-  
eral States, are the best able to judge of what is proper and conducive  
to their particular prosperity, L should venture to say that it is as  
much the interest of Georgia and South Carolina, as of any in the  
Unien. Every addition they receive to their number of slaves, tends to  
weaken them and renders them less capable of self defence. In case  
of hostilities with foreign nations, they will be the means of inviting  
attack instead of repelling invasion. It is a necessary duty of the  
general government to protect every part of the empire against dan-  
ger, as well internal as external; every thing therefore which tends  
to increase this danger, though it may bea local affair, yet if it involves  
national expense or satety, becomes of concern to every part of the  
Union, and is a proper subject for the consideration of those charged  
with the general administration of the government. I hope, in making  
these observations, I shall not be understood to mean that a proper  
attention ought not to be paid to the local opinions and circumstances  
of any part of the United States, or that the particular representatives  
are not best able to judge of the sense of their immediate coustituents.  
  
If we examine the proposeidl measure by the agreement there is  
between it, and the existing State laws, it will show us that it is  
patronized by a very respectable part of the Union. I am informed  
that South Carolina has prohibited the importation of slaves for sev-  
eral years yet to come; we have the satisfaction then of reflecting  
that we do nothing more than their own laws do at this moment.  
This is not the case with one State. Iam sorry that her situation is  
such as to seem to require a population of this nature, but it is im-  
possible in the nature of things, to consult the national good without  
doing what we do not wish to do, to some particular part. Perhaps  
gentlemen contend against the introduction of the clause, on too  
slight grounds. If it does not conform with the title of the bill,  
alter the latter; if it does not conform to the precise terms of the  
constitution, amend it. But if it will tend to delay the whole bill,  
that perhaps will be the best reason for making it the object of a  
separate one. If this is the sense of the committee I shall submit

penseof lime. But gentleman say it is  
  
improper to couduct the t wo objects, bo  
  
cause they do not come within tho tiilo of  
  
tho bill; bat the objection may be obviated  
  
by accommodating the litle to the contents.  
There may be somo inconsistency in com­  
bining the ideas whicli gentleman havo  
expressed, that is, considering the human  
race as a species of property ; but tho ev il  
  
does not arise from adopting the clause  
now proposed ; it is from the importation  
to whicli it relates. Our object in enu­  
merating persons on paper with mer­  
chandise, is to 2)revent the jiractice of  
actually treating them as such, by having  
them in future form part of the cargoes of  
goods, wares, and merchandise to bo im­  
ported into the United States. The motion  
is calculated to avoid the very evil intima­  
ted bv tho gentlemen. (The evil of con­  
sidering human beings as property.)  
It has been said that this tax ia partial  
and oppressive ; but if a fair view is taken  
of this subject, I think wo may form a  
&#x27;different conclusion. But if it be partial  
or oppressive, aro there not many instances  
in whicli we have laid taxes of this nature&#x27;?  
But are they not thought to be justified by  
national policy ? If any article is war­  
ranted on this account, how much more  
aro we authorized to proceed on this oc­  
count ? The dictates of humanity, the  
principles of the people, the natiorial safety  
and happiness, and prudent policy require  
it of vs. The Constitution lins particu­  
larly called our attention to it, and of all  
the articles contained in the bill before us,  
this is one of tho last I should bo willing  
to make a concession upon, so far as I am  
  
at lilterty to go, according to the terms of  
  
the Constitution or principles of justice  
I would not have it understood that my  
zeal would carry me to dUobey the invio­  
lable commands of either.  
I understand it has been intimated, that  
the motion was inconsistent or uncon­  
stitutional. I believe, sir, my worthy col­  
league has found the words with particular  
reference to the Constitution ; any how,  
so far as the duty is expressed, it perfectly  
accords with that instrument. If there  
are any inconsistencies in it, they may be  
rectified, I believe the intention is well  
understood, but I am far from supposing  
  
the diction improper. If tho description  
  
of the persons does not accord with the  
ideas of the gentleman from Georgia,  
(Mr. Jackson) and his idea is a proper one  
for the committee to adopt, I see no dif­  
ficulty in changing the phraseology.  
I conceive the Constitution, in that par­  
ticular, was formed in order thil the Gov­  
ernment, while it was restrained from  
laying a total prohibition, might bo able  
  
to givo some testimony of the sense of  
  
America with respect to the A mean trade.

If we examine the proposed measure by  
the agreement there is between it and the  
existing State laws, it will show us that it  
is patronized by a very respectable part of  
the Union. 1 am informed that South  
Carolina has prohibited the importation of  
slaves for several years yet to come. We  
have the satisfaction, then, of reflecting  
that we do nothing more than their own  
laws do at this moment. This is not the  
case with one Slate. I am sorry that her  
situation ia such as to seem to require a  
population of this nature ; but it is im­  
possible, in the naturo of things, to con­  
sult tho national good, without doing what  
wo wish not to do to Borne particular part.  
Perhaps gentlemen contend against the  
introduction of the clause on too slight  
grounds. If it does not comport with the  
title of the bill, alter the hitter. If it does  
not conform to tho precise tenns of the  
Constitution, amend it. But if it will  
tend &#x27;jo delay the whole bill, that, perhaps,  
will be the best reasou for making it the  
object of a separate ono. If this be the  
object of the Committee, I shall submit.

tutional power to override, it is difficult to understand why even  
the State legislatures should have power to override it. That  
this was not so understood by the framers of the constitution is  
matter of certainty. In putting a final term to the Slave-trade,  
their avowed object was to undermine Slavery itself. “In case  
of hostilities with foreign nations,” said the democratic Madison  
in 1797, “they [the slaves] will be the means of inviting attack  
instead of repelling invasion. J¢ is the necessary duty of the

When statements, as broad as this, of the general principle
