ding the first attentions, that another week has been  
			 added to the  
			 delay.  
I deplore with you the putrid state into which our newspapers have passed, and the malignity, the vulgarity, &amp; mendacious spirit of those who write for them: and I inclose you a recent sample, the production of a New-England judge, as a proof of the abyss of degradation into which we are fallen. these ordures are rapidly depraving the public taste, and lessening it’s relish for sound food. as vehicles of  
			 information, and a curb on our functionaries they have rendered themselves useless by forfieting all title to belief. that this has in a great degree been produced by the violence and malignity  
			 of  
			 party spirit I agree with you; and  
			 I have read with great pleasure the paper you inclosed me on that subject, which  
			 I  
			 now return. it is at the same time a perfect model of the style of discussion  
			 which candor and decency should observe, of the tone which renders difference of opinion even amiable, and a succinct,  
			 correct, and dispassionate history of the origin &amp; progress of party among us. it might be incorporated, as it stands, and without changing a word, into the history of the present epoch, and  
			 would give to posterity a fairer view of the times than they will probably derive from other sources. in reading it with great satisfaction there was but a single passage where I wished a little  
			 more  
			 developement of a very sound and Catholic idea, a single intercalation to rest it solidly on true bottom.  
			 it is near the end of the 1st page, where you make a statement of  genuine republican maxims, saying ‘that the people ought to possess as much political power as can possibly consist with the order and security of society.’ instead of this I would say  
			 ‘that the  
			 people being the only safe depository of power, should exercise in person every function which their qualifications enable them to exercise consistently with the order and security of society;  
			 that  
			 we now find them equal to the election of those who shall be invested with their Executive and legislative powers, and to act themselves in the Judiciary, as judges in questions of fact’; that  
			 the  
			 range of their powers ought to be enlarged Etc. this gives both the reason and exemplification of the maxim you express ‘that they ought to possess as much political power’ Etc.I see nothing to correct  
			 either in your facts or principles.  
You say that in taking Genl Washington on your shoulders, to bear him harmless thro’ the Federal coalition, you encounter a perilous topic. I do not think so. you have given the genuine history of the course of his mind thro the  
			 trying scenes in which it was engaged, and of the seductions by which it was decieved, but not depraved. I think I knew General Washington intimately and thoroughly; and were I called on to delineate his character it should be in terms like these.  
His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first order; his penetration strong, tho’ not so acute as that of a Newton, Bacon or Locke; and as far as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. it was slow in operation, being little aided by invention or imagination, but sure in conclusion. hence the common remark of his  
			 officers, of the advantage he derived from councils of war, where hearing all suggestions, he selected whatever was best. and certainly no General ever planned his battles more judiciously. but if  
			 deranged during the course of the action, if any member of his plan was dislocated by sudden circumstances, he was slow in re-adjustment. the consequence was that he often failed in the field, &amp;  
			 rarely against an enemy in station, as at Boston &amp; York. he was incapable of fear, meeting personal dangers with the calmest unconcern. perhaps the strongest feature in his character was  
			 prudence, never acting until every circumstance, every  
			 consideration was maturely weighed; refraining if he saw a doubt, but, when once decided, going through with his purpose whatever obstacles opposed. his integrity was most pure, his justice the  
			 most  
			 inflexible I have ever known, no motives of interest or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred, being able to bias his decision. in his expences he was honorable, but exact; liberal in contributions to whatever promised utility, but frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects, and all unworthy calls on his charity. his heart was not warm in it’s affections, but he exactly calculated he was indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a good, &amp; a great man. his temper was naturally irritable and high toned; but reflection &amp; resolution had obtained a firm and  
			 habitual ascendancy over it. if ever however it broke it’s bonds he was most tremendous in his wrath. in his expences he was liberal honorable, but exact; liberal in contributions to whatever promised utility; but frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects, and all unworthy calls on his charity. his heart was not warm in it’s  
			 affections; but he exactly calculated every man’s value, and gave him a solid esteem proportioned to it.his person, you know, was fine, his stature  
			 exactly what one would wish, his  
			 deportment  
			 easy, erect, and noble; the best horseman of his age, and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback. altho’ in the circle of his friends, where he might be unreserved with safety,  
			 he  
			 took a free share in conversation, his colloquial talents were not above mediocrity, possessing neither copiousness of ideas, nor fluency of words. in public when called on for a sudden opinion,  
			 he  
			 was unready, short, and embarrassed. yet he wrote readily, rather diffusely, in an easy &amp; correct style. this he had acquired by conversation with the world for his education was merely  
			 reading,  
			 writing, and common arithmetic, to which he added surveying at a later day. his time was employed in action chiefly, reading little, and that only in Agriculture and English history. his  
			 correspondence became necessarily extensive, and, with journalising his agricultural proceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within doors. on the whole, his character was, in it’s mass  
			 perfect, in nothing bad, in few points indifferent; and it may truly be said that never did nature and fortune combine more perfectly to make a man great, and to place him in the same  
			 constellation  
			 with whatever worthies have merited from man an everlasting remembrance. for his was the singular destiny &amp; merit of leading the armies of his country succesfully thro’ an arduous war for the establishment of it’s independance, of conducting it’s councils thro’ the birth of a government, new in it’s forms and principles, until it had settled down into a quiet and orderly train, and of scrupulously obeying the laws, thro’ the whole of his career, civil and military, of which the history of the world furnishes no other example. how then can it be perilous for you to take such a man on your shoulders? I am satisfied the great body of republicans thinks of him as I do.  
			 we were indeed dissatisfied with him on his ratification of the British treaty. but this was short lived.  
			 we knew his honesty, the wiles with which he was encompassed, and that age had already  
			 begun to relax the  
			 firmness of his purposes: and I am convinced he is more  
			 deeply seated in the love and gratitude of the republicans, than in the Pharisaical homage of the Federal monarchists. for he was no monarchist from preference of his judgment. the soundness of  
			 that  
			 gave him correct views of the rights of man, and his severe justice devoted him to them. he has often declared to me that he considered our new constitution as an experiment on the practicability  
			 of  
			 republican government, and with what dose of liberty man could be trusted for his own good: that he was determined the experiment should have a fair trial, and would lose the last drop of his  
			 blood  
			 in support of it. and these declarations he repeated to me the oftener, and the more pointedly, because  
			 he knew my suspicions of Colo Hamilton’s views, and probably had heard from him the same declarations which I had, to wit, ‘that the British constitution with it’s unequal representation, corruption and other existing abuses, was the most perfect government which had ever been established on earth, and that a reformation of these abuses would make it an impracticable government.’ I do believe that Genl Washington had not a firm confidence in the durability of our government. he was naturally distrustful of men, and inclined to gloomy apprehensions; and I was ever persuaded that a belief that we must  
			 at length end in something like a British constitution had some weight in his adoption of the ceremonies of levees, birth-days, pompous meetings with Congress, and other forms of the same character, calculated to prepare us gradually for a change which he believed possible, and to let it come on with as little shock as might be to the public mind.  
These are my opinions of General Washington, f which I would vouch at the judgment seat of god, having been formed on an acquaintance of 30. years. I served with him in the Virginia legislature from 1769. to the revolutionary war, and again a short time in Congress until he left us to take command of the army. during the war and after it we corresponded occasionally, and in the 4. years of my continuance in the office of Secretary of state, our intercourse was daily, confidential and cordial. after I retired from that office great and malignant pains were taken by our Federal-monarchists and not entirely without effect, to make him view me as a theorist, holding French principles of government which would lead infallibly to licentiousness and anarchy. and to this he listened  
			 the more easily from my known disapprobation of the British treaty. I never saw  
			 him afterwards, or these malignant insinuations should have been  
			 dissipated before his just judgment as mists before the sun. I felt on his death, with my countrymen, that ‘verily a great man hath fallen this day in Israel.’  
More time and recollection would enable me to add many other traits of his character; but why add them to you, who knew him well? and I cannot justify to myself a longer detention of your paper. Vale, propriéque tuum, me esse tibi persuadeas.

ductiou of a Ncw-Eiigluud judge, ns n proof ef the al»y»  
of degradation into whiclt we have fallen. *?Vse ordure:  
are rapidly depraving the public tusto, and lossohing it:  
relish for sound food. As vehicles of information, and c  
&#x27;&lt;-urb on our functionaries they have rendered&#x27; thcmselv*.  
useless, by forfeiting all title to belief. That this has in 3  
great degree been produced by the violence and maligtii.  
‘ty-of party spirit I agree with you ; and I have rend will]  
great pleasure the pap*r you inclosed mo on Ilia* subject  
.which I now return. It is ct tlie same time a perfect mod­  
el of the stylo of discussion which candor and decency  
shoo Id observe, of the tone which renders difference ol  
Opinion even amiable, and u succinct, correct, and dis­  
passionate history of the origin and progress of party  
among us. It might ho incorporated, as it stands, and  
without changing a word, into the history of the present  
epoch, and would give to posterity a fairer view of the  
times than they will probably derivo from other sources.  
In roading it with great satisfa lion there was but a single  
passage where l wished a little inure dcvclopcmant of u  
very sound and Catholic Idea, a single intercalation&#x27; to  
rest it solidly on true bottom. It is near the cn.l oflhu  
1st £agc, where you make a st itcm- sit of genuine repub­  
lican maxima ; saying “ that the people ought to possess  
as much political powor as can possibly consist with tlio  
ordor and security of sdcjpty.” Instead of this I would  
•cy that the people being the only sale depository of  
power, should exercise in person every function which  
tlinir qualifications enable them &quot;to exercise consistently  
with tiio order and security of society ; that wo now foul  
them equal to the election of those who shall be invested  
with their executive ami legislative powers, and to act  
themselves in the judiciary, as judges in questions of  
fact; that the range of their powers ought to be enlarged  
•tc-” This gives both the reason and1 exemplification of  
the maxim you express * that they ought to possess as  
n*uch political power A;.’ I see nothing to correct either  
in rour facts or nrincioles.  
  
You say that in taking (ion. Washington on your  
shoulders, to hoar him harmless through the Federal Coal­  
ition, y»u encounter a perilous topic. I do not think so ;  
you hare given the .genuine history r.ftlic course of his  
inind through the trying scenes in which it was engaged,  
and of the seductions&#x27; by which’it was deceived, but^iiot  
depraved. I think l knew Gen. Washington intimately  
aaul thoroughly ; and were I called on to delineate his

course oftho action, if any member of his plan was dislo­  
cated by sudden circumstances, he was slow in re-adjust  
mont. The consequenco was that he oflon failed in the  
Hold, and rarely against ail enemy in station, as at Huston  
and York. He was incapable ot tear, meeting personal  
dangers with the calmest unconcern. I’erhap , the .strong­  
091 feature in his character .was prudence.* never acting/  
Until every circumotaip.e, every consideration was ma­

onco decided, going through with his purpose whatever

Deau Ski—1 deplore with you the putrid slate  
into which our newspapers have passed,.and the  
malignite, the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit  
of those who write lor them; and I enclose you  
ft recent sample, the pioduclion o( a New Eng­  
land judge, as a proof of the abyss of degrada­  
tion into which we have fallen. 1 hese oidures  
are iapidly depra&gt;ing the public taste, and les­  
soning its relish for sound food. As vehicles  
of information, and a cutb on our functionaries  
they have rendered themselves useless, by for­  
feiting all title to belief. 1 hat this has in a  
great degree been produced bv the violence 8c  
maligni’y of party spirit I agree with you;*and  
1 have read with great pleasure the paper you  
inclosed me on that subject, which I now return,  
Ii is at the same time a perfect model of the style  
of discussion which candor Sc decency should  
observe, of the tone which renders difference of  
&#x27;opinion even amiable, and a suet inct, correct,  
and dispassionate history of the origin and pro­  
gress of party among us It might be incor­  
porated, as it stands, and without changing a  
word, into the history of the present epoch, and  
would give toposteii y a fairer view ol the tim s  
than they will probably derive from oilier sour­  
ces. In reading it with great satisfaction there  
was hut a single passage where 1 wished a lit­  
^ tie more dev elopement of a very sound and  
Catholic Idea, a single intercalation to test it  
solidly on true bottom. It is near the end of  
the 1st page, where you make a statement of  
genuine republican maxims; saying “that the  
people ought to possess as much political pow­  
er as can possibly consist with the order and  
security ol society.” Instead of this I would  
say, “that the people being the only safe de­  
pository of power, should exercise in person  
every function which their qualifications enable  
  
mem to excicise consisietmy »mi me uiuu  
and security of society; that we now find them  
equal to the election of those who shall he in­  
vested with their executive and legislative pow­  
ers, and to act themselves in the judiciary, as  
judges in questions of fact; that ih&lt; range of  
their poweisough* to he enlarged ect.” 1 his  
gives ho* It the reason and exemplification of the  
maxim you express ‘that they ought to possess  
as much political power See.’ I see nothing to  
correct either in your facts or principles.  
You say ihat in iaktng Gen Washington on  
your shoulders, to bear him harmless inrough  
the Federal Coalition, von encounter a perilous  
topic. I do not think so; you ha&#x27;C givt-n the  
genuine history of the course ol his mind  
thr ugh the trying semes in which it was en­  
gaged, and of the seductions by which it was  
deceived, hut not depravt d. I think I knew  
Gen. Washington it.timately and thoroughly;  
and wrte I called on to delineate his character  
it should (,e in terms &#x27;ike these.  
Ilis mind was great and powerful, vvithou*  
being of the very lost order; his ne-etration  
strong, though not so acu’C as that of a New­  
ton, Bacon, or Locke; and as far as he 3. vv, no  
judgement was ever sounder It was slow in  
oppi&#x27;3Uon, being little .Jdrd by invention or im­  
agination, but su*e In ennriulnwii, «•«.«•«.» «»v

all suggestions, he selected whatever was best;  
and certain&#x27;y no General ever planned his bat­  
tles more judiciously. But if deranged during  
the course of the action, if any member of his  
plan was dislocated by sudden circumstances,  
he was slow in re-adjustment The consequence  
WuS that he often failed in the field, and raielv

the !,ws thioug the whole ol his career, civil  
and rotlttai), of winch the history, of the world  
  
furnishes no other example. Ihovv then can it |  
he perilous* for you 10 tuke such a man on your ,  
shoulders? I am satisfied the great bodv of  
Republicans think ofhiin as I do—we were in­  
deed dissatisfied with him on his ratification  
of the British treaty, hut this was short-lived.  
We knew his honesty, the wiles with which he  
was encompassed, and Hut age ha 1 already, be­  
gun to relax the firmness of his purposes: and  
I am convinced that lie is more deeply seated  
in the love and gratitude of the Republican-,  
than in the phai isaical homage of the Federal  
Monarchists. For lie was no Monarchist from  
preference of his judgment. The soundness ol i  
that gave him coirect views of the rights of  
man, and his severe justice devoted him to  
them. He has often declared to me that he  
considered our new con&#x27;s&#x27;itution as an expet i­  
ment on tire practicability of republican gov­  
ernment, and with what dose of liberty man  
could be trusted lor his own good: that be was  
determined the experiment should have a fair  
trial, ami would lose the last drop of his blood  
in support ol it. And these he repeated to me  
Hie ofener, and the more pointedly, because he  
knew my suspicions of Col Hamilton’s views  
and probably had heard from him the same  
declarations which I had, to wit:—“ I hat the  
British Constitution with its unequal represen­  
tation, corruption and other existing abuses,  
wav the most perfect&#x27;government which bad  
ever been established on earth, and that a re­  
formation of these abuses would make it an im­  
practicable government.” I do believe that  
Gen. Washington had not a firm confidence in  
the durability ofnur government. He was na­  
ttirally distrustful of men, and inclined to gloo­  
my apprehensions and I was ever per uaded  
that a belief that we must at length end in  
something like a Bri i-h Constitution had som«  
weight in his adoption ol the ceremonies of j  
levees, birth days, pompous meetings with I  
Congress, and otliei forms of the same rharac- |  
tSr, calculated to prepare us gpadu&lt;illy for a I  
rlinturn whirl* !*»* ht lined nnssiMe. .*nd so let  
  
it come op. with as little shock as might he .to  
tin* public mind —These are my opinion* of  
Gen. Washington, winch I would vout h at  
the judgment seat of God, having been formed  
on an acquaintance of 30 years. I serv«d with  
him in the Vitginia Legislature from 1769 to  
the revolutionary war. and again a short lime  
in Congress until he left us to take command  
of the army. During the war and after it we  
corresponded occasionally, and in the 4 years  
of n&gt;&gt; continuance in the office of Secretary of*  
Sta r, our intercourse was daily, confidential  
and coidial. After I retired from that office  
groat and malignant patns were taken by our  
Federal monarchists, and not entirely without  
■ IT ct, to make him view &gt;ne as a theorist,  
boding French principles • f government which  
would lead infallibly to licentiousness and an­  
archy. And to this he ILom d the mor* easily  
from my known disapprolm &#x27;on of the Bri&#x27;ish  
treaty 1 never saw him af erwartls, or &#x27;he-e  
malignant insinuations should have been dissi­  
1 paled before his just judgment .,.*&gt; m sts befort  
the sun. I felt on his death, with my,country­  
men, that “verily a gn at man hath (alien this  
day in Israel ”  
More lime and recollection would enable jt»«­

We have lately had the pleasure of presenting  
o our readers a letter from Mr. Jefferson to Dr.  
Junes, in which is drawn a masterly and vivid  
sketch of the father of his country. One sen­  
tence in that letter could not fail of striking the  
observation of every one w ho perusrd it.  
*‘11 is was the singular destiny and merit ol  
leading the armies of his country through an ar­  
luous war lor the establishment of its indepni­  
Irncc, of conducting its councils through the  
iirth of*government, new in it* forms and piin­  
riples, until it had settl&#x27;d down iu a quiet «r*d  
jrderly train, and ofscrupulously obeying this  
LAWS&#x27;inROUGH rtlfc WHOLE OF HIS CAREER, CI­  
VIL ACND military.” How does t» U square with  
the conduct of our Chieftain. When did Ae ev­  
er scrupulously obey any law v\ hich came it op  
position to his own wishes? When did h. ever  
hesitate to violate a law when opposed to his  
inclination-? His whole life has been a con&#x27;in­  
ied series i f lawless and tyrunical measures —  
lie never held an ofli ee either civil or military  
in which he has not committed some act in dis­  
  
ibrdience to the L nstitution or laws o. ms  
ouutry. He seems to have made it a point in  
11 situations iu which he has l»re

Dear Sir :—I deplore with you the putrid  
state into which our newspapers have passed,  
and the malignanty, the vulgarity, anti men­  
dacious spirit of those who write for them ;  
and I enclose you a recent sample, the pro­  
duction of a New-England Judge, as a proof  
of the abyss of degradation into which we  
have fallen. These ordures are rapidly  
depraving the publick taste, and lessening  
its relish for sound food. As vehicles of in­  
formation, and a curb on our functionaries,  
they have rendered themselves useless, by  
forfeiting all title to belief. That this has,  
in a great degree, been produced by the vio­  
lence and malignity of party spirit, I agree  
with you; and I have read with great plea­  
sure the paper you enclosed me on that sub­  
ject, which I now return. It is, at the same  
time, a perfect model of the style of discus­  
sion which candour and decency should ob­  
serve, of the tone which renders difference  
of opinion even amiable, and a succinct,  
correct, and dispassionate history of the  
origin and progress of party among us. It  
might be incorporated, as it stands, and with­  
out changing a word, into the history of the  
present epoch, and would give to posterity a  
feirer view of the times than they will proba­  
bly derive from other sources. In reading  
it with great satisfaction, there was but a  
single passage where I wished a little more  
developement of a very sound and catholic  
idea, a single intercalation to rest it solidly  
on true bottom. It is near the end of the  
first page, where you make a statement of  
genuine Republican maxims ; saying “ that  
the People ought to possess as much politi­  
cal power as can possibly consist with the  
order and security of society.” Instead of  
this, I would say, “that the People, being  
the only safe depository of power, should  
exercise, in person, every function which  
their qualifications enable them to exercise,  
inconsistently with the order and security of  
society; that we now find them eqal to the  
election of those who shall be invested with  
their Executive and Legislative powers, and  
to act themselves in the Judiciary, as judges  
in questions of feet; that the range of their  
powers ought to be enlarged,” etc. This  
gives both the reason and exemplification of  
the maxim you express, “that they ought to  
possess as much political power,” &amp;c. I see  
nothing to correct either in your facts or  
principles.  
You say, that, in taking Gen. Washington  
on your shoulders, to bear him harmless  
through the Federal Coalition, you encounter  
a perilous topic. I do not think so; you  
have given the genuine history of the course  
of his mind through the trying scenes in  
which he was engaged, and of the seductions  
by which it was deceived, but not depraved.  
I think I knew Gen. Washington intimately  
and thoroughly; and, were I called on to  
deliniate his character, it should be in terms  
like these.  
His mind was great and powerful, without  
being of the very first onjer ; his penetra­  
tion strong, though not so acute as that of  
Newton, Bacon, or Locke ; and, as far as  
he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. It  
was slow in operation, being little aided by  
invention or imagination, but sure in con­  
clusion. Hence the commom remark of his  
officers, of the advantage he derived from  
councils of war, where, hearing all sugges­  
tions, he selected whatever was best; and  
certainly no general ever planed his bat­  
tles more judiciously. But, if deranged  
during the course of the action, if any mem­  
ber of his plan was dislocated by sudden  
circumstances,he was slow in re-adjustment.  
The consequence was, that he often failed  
in the field, and rarely against an enemy in  
station, as at Boston and York. He was in­  
capable of fear, meeting personal dangers  
with the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the  
strongest feature in his character was pru­  
dence, never acting until every circumstance,  
every consideration, was maturely weighed;  
refraining if he saw a doubt, but, when once  
decided, going through with his purpose,  
whatever obstacles opposed. His integrity  
was most pure, his justice the most inflexi­  
ble I have ever known, no motives of inter­  
est or consanguinity, of friendship or ha­  
tred, being able to bias his decision. He  
was, indeed, in every sense of the word, a  
wise, a good, and a great man. His temper  
was naturally irritable and high toned: but  
reflection and resolution had obtained a firm  
and habitual ascendency over it. If ever,  
however, it broke its bounds, he was most  
tremendous in his wrath. In his expenses,  
he was honourable, but exact; liberal in  
contributions to whatever promised utility;  
but frowning and unyielding on all visiona­  
ry projects and all unworthy calls on his  
charity. His heart was not warm in its af­  
fections; but he exactly calculated every  
man’s value, and gave him a solid esteem  
proportioned to it. His person, you know  
was fine, his stature exactly what one would  
wish, his deportment easy, erect, and noble;  
the best horseman of his age, and the most  
graceful figure that could be seen on horse­  
back. Although, in the circle of his friends,  
where he might be unreserved with safety,  
he took a free share in conversation, his col­  
loquial talents were not above mediocrity,  
possessing neither copiousness of ideas, nor  
fluency of words. In public, when called  
on for a sudden opinion, he was unready,  
short, and embarrassed. Yet he wrote  
readily, rather diffusely, in a correct style.  
This he had acquired by conversation with  
the world: for his education was merely  
reading, writing, and common arithmetick,  
to which he added surveying at a later day.  
His time was employed in action, chiefly  
reading little, and that only in agriculture  
and English History. His correspondence  
became necessarily extensive, and, with  
journalizing his agricultural proceedings,  
occupied most of his leisure hours within  
doors. On the whole, his character was, in  
its mass, perfect, in nothing bad, in few  
points indifferent; and it may truly be said,  
that never did nature and fortune combine  
more perfectly to make a man great, and to  
place him in the same constellation with  
whatever worthies have merited from&gt;man

an everlasting remembrance. For his was  
the singular destiny and merit of leading the  
armies of his country successfully through  
an arduous war, for the establishment of its  
independence, of conducting its councils  
through the birth of a government, new in  
its forms and principles, until it had settled  
down in a quiet and orderly train, and of  
scrupulously obeying the laws through the  
whole of his career, civil and military, of  
which the history of the world furnishes no  
other example. How then can it be peril­  
ous for you to take such a man on your  
shoulders ? I am satisfied the great body  
of Republicans think of him as I do. We  
were, indeed dissatisfied with him on his 1  
ratification of the British Treaty ; but this  
was short-lived. We knew his honesty, the  
wiles with which he was encompassed, and  
that he had already begun to relax the firm­  
ness of his purpose ; and I am convinced  
he is more deeply seated in the love and  
gratitude of the Republicans, than in the  
Pharisaical homage of the Federal Monarch­  
ists. For he was no monarchist from pre­  
ference of his judgment. The soundness  
of that gave him correct views of the rights  
of man, and his severe justice devoted him  
to them. He has often declared to me, that  
he considered our new Constitution as an ca­  
periment on the practicability of republican  
government, and ■with what dose of liberty  
man can be trusted for his own good; and  
he was determined the experiment should  
have a fair trial, and would lose the last drop  
of his blood in support of it. And these he  
repeated to me the oftener, and more point­  
edly, because he knew my suspicions of  
Col. Hamilton’s views, and probably had  
heard the declarations which I had heard, to  
wit—“ That the British Constitution,with its  
unequal representation, corruption, and oth­  
er existing abuses, was the most perfect  
Government which had ever been establish­  
ed on earth, and that a reformation of these  
abuses would make it an impracticable Gov­  
ernment.”  
I do believe that General Washington had  
not a firm confidence in the durability of our  
Government. He was naturally distrustful  
of men, and inclined to gloomy apprehen­  
sions ; and I was ever persuaded that a be­  
lief that we must at length end in something  
like a British Constitution had some weight  
in his adoption of the ceremonies of levees,  
birth-days; pompous-meetings with Congress,  
and other forms of the same character, cal­  
culated to prepare us gradually for a change  
which is believed possible, and so let it come  
on with as little shock as might be to the  
publick mind. These are my opinions of  
Gen. Washington, for which I would vouch  
at the judgment seat of God, having been  
formed on acquaintance of 30 years. I served  
with him in the Virginia Legislature from  
1799 to the Revolutionary war, and again a  
short time in Congress, until he left us to  
take command of the army. During the  
war, and after it, we corresponded occasion­  
ally, and in the four years of my continuance  
in the office of Secretary of State, our inter­  
course was daily, confidential, and cordial.  
After I retired from that office, great and  
malignant pains were taken by our Federal  
monarchists, and not entirely without effect,  
to make him view me as a theorist, holding  
French principles of government, which  
would lead infallibly to licentiousness and  
anarchy. And to this he listened the more  
easily, from my known disapprobation of the  
British treaty. I never saw him afterwards,  
or these insinuations should have been dis­  
sipated before his just judgment, as mists  
before the sun. I felt, on his death, with  
my countrymen, that “verily a great man  
hath fallen this day in Israel.”  
More time and recollection would enable  
me to add many other traits of his charac­  
ter ; but why add them to you who know  
them well ? and I cannot justify to myself a  
longer detention of your paper. Vale,  
propriaque tuum, me esse tibi persuadeas.

Peas Sis: 1 deplore with you that pu­  
trid state into w hich our newspapers have  
passed, and tins malignity, the vulgarity,  
ami mendacious spirit ot those who write  
for tliem; and I enclose you a recent sample,  
the production of a Mew England Judge,  
as a proof cf the abyss ot degradation into  
w hich we have ndlen. These ordures are  
rapidly depraving the public taste, and les­  
sening its relish for sound food. As vehi­  
cles of information, and a curb on our  
functionaries, they have rendered them­  
selves use)ass, by forf&amp;ting all title to be­  
lief. T hai this has, i n a great degree, been  
produced by the violence and nuJignity o:  
party spirit, I agree with you; and I have  
read &lt;*ifh great pleasure the paper you en­  
sile* ne on that subject, which I now re -  
:tum. ft is, at the same time, a perfect  
i-f rrH of the style of discussion which can­  
dor ted decency should observe, of the  
to.re which renders ddfcrence of opinion  
even amiable, andu succinct, correct, and  
dispassionate history cf die origin and pro­  
gress of party among us. It icight b&lt;  
•ncorporatod, as it stands, and without  
chancing a word, the history ot the  
present epoch, and weoM gi&#x27;e to posteri  
♦v a fairer view of the times than they will  
nrobablv derive from oilier sources. In  
  
leading it wiifc great satisfaction, there  
xv,is but a single oissage where I wished  
3 hiile more devetopoinent of a very sound  
and cbatholtc uea, a single intercalation  
to rest it sokEv on true bottom. It is near  
the end of tin-«rst page, where you make a  
Statement«; genuine Republican maxims;  
saying, “tha: the People ought to possess  
Os much paksical power as can possibly  
consist witt ine order and security of so­  
-Clety.,, Instead of this. I would say, “that  
the People being the only 9ufe depository  
-of power, ehoold exercise, in person, every  
function-which their qualifications) enable  
them tc * xerciae, consistcnly with the or­  
der aud security of society; that we now  
find th«c equal to the election of those who  
shall he invested with their Executive and  
Legislative powers, and to act themselves  
in the Judiciary, as judges in question of  
fact; that the range of their powers ought  
to be enlarged,** etc. This gives both the  
reason and exemplification of the maxim  
you exprc*i. “that they ought to possess  
js much pohdeal power,&#x27; &amp;e. I see noth  
mg to cor.^ : c ther m your facts or prin­  
ciples  
You sa; :r a*, in taking General Wash­  
mgton or. -our shoulders, to bear him  
hari nless .c-&#x27;ugh ‘die Federal Coalition. !  
you encounter a perilous topic. 1 do not  
think so; y.n:- nave given the genuine his­  
tory of the course of his mind through the  
trving scene m which it was engaged, and  
of the seducoensbv which it was deceived,  
but not deoreved. 1 think I knew General  
“W ashing or ntimately and thoroughly,  
and, wore I called on to delineate his char­  
acter, it sr.ould be in terms like these.  
His mird w as groat and powerful, with­  
out being of the very first order; lus peue  
tration arciig. though not so acute as that  
of a Newton, l&gt;acon, or Loe.ke; and, as  
far as ae saw, no judgement was ever  
sounder was slow m operation, being  
little aided bv invention or imagination,  
but sure in conclusion. Hence the com­  
mon r cm? v ot lus officers, of tho advant­  
ag» be derived from councils of war, where,  
hea rm; id suggestions, lie selected what-!  
ever was nest; and certainly no General  
over plans-&#x27; l hts battles more judiciously.  
  
But, it deranged during the course ot the  
action, u ny member ot his plan was dis­  
located by :udden circumstances, he was  
slow in re-adjustment The consequence  
vas, tbavno often failed in the field, and  
rarely against au enemy in station, as at  
Boston anc York. He was incapable of  
Sear, meeting personal dangers with the  
Calmest unconcern. Perhaps the strang-i  
cst feature :it his character was prudence,  
jjevor acting until every circumstance,  
every oootuurration, was maturely weigh­  
ed; refirlining if he saw adcubt, but, when  
once dcc&#x27;ifea, going ihroiigii with hi9 pur­  
pose. whac&quot; obstacles apposed. His  
inlagritv wa «n«o t pure, his justice the  
most inflexibn I have ever .viiown, no mo­  
tives of mtore*r cr consanguinity. of friend­  
ship or bafroc being abh. to bias his de­  
cision. He was. indeed, in every sense  
of the word •* wise, r. good, and a ereat  
ruan. His temper was naturally irritable  
and high toned; hut reflection and resolu­  
tion had obmircd a tine and habitual as­  
cendancy over -it. It ever, however, it  
broke its bounds, lie was most tremendous  
in his wrath ic his expenses, he was hon­  
orable, but corset; liberal in soatnbutions  
to whatever promised utility; but frowning  
and un\hiding cn all -visiouary projects,  
and all unworthy calls on his charity. His &#x27;  
heart was pot warm ,n its ejections; but!  
he exactly calculated every man’s value,  
4»d gave ham a re id esteem proportioned  
to it. His person, you know, was tine,  
his stature exactly what one would wish,  
his deportment easy, erect, and noble? the  
best horseman of bic- age, and the most  
graceful tigure that ~ou!d be seen on horse­  
back. Although, mthocircle of his friends,  
where he might be unreserved with satetv,  
he took a free shares conversation, his  
colloquial talents were not above medioc­  
rity, possessing ueither copiousness of  
ideas, nor fluency of words. In public,  
when called on for a sudden opinion, he  
was unready, short, and embarrassed. Yet  
he wrote readily,.rather djlfuselv. in a cor­  
-lect style. This he had acquired by con­  
versation with the world: for his education  
v is merely reading, writing, and common  
arithmetic, to which he a»lded surveying  
at a later date. His time vyas employed  
in action, chiefly, reading little, and that  
.Jiuy j£ agriculture and English History.  
  
iITia correspondence became necessarily  
I extensive, and, witb journalising his agri­  
cultural proceedings, occupied most of his  
leisure hours within doors. On the whole,  
his character was, in its mass, perfect, in  
nothing bad, in few points indifferent; and  
it may truly be said, that never did nature  
and lortune combine more perfectly to  
make a man great, and to place him. in the  
same constellation w ith whatever worthies  
have merited from man an everlasting re­  
membrance. For his was the singular des­  
tiny and merit of leading the armies of his  
country successtullv through an arduous  
war, for the establishment of its independ­  
ence, ot conducting its councils through  
the birth of a government, new in its forms  
and principles, until it had settled down in  
a quiet and orderly train, and of scrupulous­  
ly obeying the laws through the whole of  
iiis career, ci\ ll and military, of which the  
history of the world furnishes no other ex­  
ample. How then can it be perilous lor  
you to take such a man on your shoulders?  
1 ain satisfied the great body of Republi­  
cans think of him as 1 do. We w ere, in­  
deed dissatisfied with lnm on his ratifica­  
tion of tile lJritish Treaty; but tins was  
short lived. We know ins honesty, the  
wiles with which lie was encompassed, and  
that age had already begun to relax the  
firmness of his purposes: and 1 am con­  
vinced he is more deeply seated in the  
love and gratitude of the Republicans, than  
in the Pharisaical homage of the Federal  
  
Monarchists, for he was no monarchist  
from preference of his judgment. The  
soundness ot that gave lmn correct views  
of the rights of man, and Ins severe justice  
devoted hnn to them, lie has often declar­  
ed to me, that he considered our new Con­  
stitution as an experiment on t&#x27;he proba­  
bility of republican government, and with  
what dose of liberty man can be tnsted  
tor his own good: that he was deterniued  
the experiment should have a fair trial and  
would loose the last drop of his blo(d in  
support of it. And these he repeutid to  
me the oftner, and more pointedly, beause  
he knew my suspicious of Col. Hamilton&#x27;s  
views, and probably had heard the dicla­  
rutioiis which 1 had heard, to wit—‘that  
the British Constitution, w ith its uuojual  
representation, corruption, and othei ex­  
isting abuses, was the most perfect (iov­  
enmieiit which hud ever been establified  
on earth, and that a reformation of these  
abuses would make it an impracticable  
Government.  
1 do believe that Gen. Washington lnd

trustful of men, and inclined to gloomy ap­  
prehensions; and I was ever persuaded

the same character, calculated to prepare  
us gradually ibr a change which he believ­  
ed possible, and so let it come on with as  
little shock as might be to the public mind.

Dear Sir: I deplore with you the putrid state in­  
to which our newspapers have passed, ami the  
malignity, the vulgsiity, and mendacious spit it of  
. those who wlife fot them; and I enclose you h  
reoent sample, the production of a New England  
•fudge, as a proof of the abyss of degiadaliou into  
which we have fallen. These orders arc rapidly  
depraving the public taste, and lessening its relish  
tor sound food. As vehicles ot information, and u  
ruib on our functionalios, they have rendered  
themselves useless, by forfeiting all title to belief.  
That this has, in a great degree, been produced byv  
the violence and malignity of party spiiit, I agree  
with you; and I have read with great pleasure the  
paper you enclosed me on the subject, which I  
ttow return. It is, at the same time, a perfect  
model of the style of discussion which candor and  
decency should observe, of the tone which rentiers  
difference of opinion even amiable, and a succinct,  
correct, and dispassionate history of the o ’if&#x27;^n and’  
progress of parly among ns. It might be incorpo­  
rated, as it stands, and without changing a word,!  
into the history of the present epoch, and would  
give to posterity a fairer view of the times than  
they will probably derive from other sources, in  
reading it with great satisfaction, there was but a  
t ingle passage where I wished a little more do­  
velopeinent of a -.cry sound and catholic idea, a  
single intercalation to rest it solid!* on true bottom.  
Jt is near the end of the fir-t page, where you  
malm a statement of genuine UepubJicuu maxims;  
saying, “ that ilia people ought to possess an much |  
political power as can possibly consist with the  
Older and security of society.” Instead of this, T  
would say, “that tho People, being the only saf.­  
depository of power, should exercise, in person,  
every function which their qualification* enable’  
them to exorcise, consistently with tho order and  
security of society; that we now find them equal  
to the election of those who shall be invested with  
their Executive and Legislative powers, and to  
act tin niseives in the Judiciary, as judges in ques­  
tlonsof fact; tli.it the range of their powers ought  
to ho enlarged,” etc. This gives both the reason  
and exemplification of the maxim you express,  
“ ought to possess as much political  
power,” &amp;.&lt;•. 1 see nothing to correct cither in  
vOur facts or principles.  
You say, that, in taking General Washington on  
Mvour shoulders, to bear him harmless through the  
■Toilers! Coalition, you encounter a perilous topic,  
i do not think so; you have given the genuine bis- *  
tory el the course of his n.ind through the trying !  
scenes in which it was engaged, and of tho seduc-!  
tions by which it was deceived, but not depraved, i  
i think 1 knew General Washington intimately and i  
thoroughly; and, were I called on to delineate his  
c!i.uacter, it should he in terms like these:  
His mind was great uud powerful, without be- !  
i.’i-t of the very first order: his nenetrnimn &#x27;  
  
&lt;hough not so acute as thatol a Newton, Bacon, 01 I  
I.ocke; and, as tar as he .-aw, no judgment was I  
ever bounder. It was slow in operation, bein&quot;-‘  
little aided by invention or imagination, but sure 1  
in conclusion. Ifenci. tho common remark of his  
officers, of tiie advantage he derived from councils  
of war, where, hearing all suggestions, he select­  
ed whatever was best; and certainly no General  
ever planned bis battles more judiciously. Bui, if&#x27;  
de.rangcd during tho course of the action, if any i  
member ofhi.x plan was dislocated by sudden rir- J  
rtimsfnnces, he was slow in re-adjustment. The!  
consequence was, that he often failed in the field, *  
aud rarely against an enemy in station, as at Boston !  
iitid York, flu was incapable of fear, rusetirj’&#x27;!  
personal dangers with the calmest unconcern.—  
Perhaps tho strongest feature in his character was  
prudence, never acting until every circumstance,  
every consideration, was maturely weighed; re­  
Iraimng if he saw a doubt, but, when once de­  
cided, going through with his purpose, whatever  
obstacle* oppo-id. Ilia integrity was mod pure,  
his justice the most inflexible I have ever known,;  
;.o motives of interest or consanguinity, of friend- j  
&#x27;hip or hatred, being able to bias his decision.—  
JIa was, indeed, in every sense of the word, a  
wise, b good, and a great man. Hu tamper w is •  
naturally irritable and high-toned: but reflection  
: uiJ resolution had obtained a firm and habitual as­  
cendancy over it. If ever, however, it broke its  
sounds, he was most tremendous in his wrath. In  
his expenses, be was honorable, but exact; liberal  
in contiibutions to whatever promised utility; but  
Jrowning and unyielding on all visionary projects  
and all unworthy calls on his charily. Hi* heart 1  
was not warm in iu affections; but be exactly cal  
ciliated every man’s value, and gave him a solid  
esteem proportioned to it. His person, you know,  
vras line, hisstaturc exactly whut one would wish!  
hw deportment easy, erect, and noble; the beat  
horseman ol his age, and the most graceful hgucc  
that could be seen on horseback. Although, in tin  
Circle of his fiends, where he might be unreserv­  
od with safety, he Wok a free shale in conversa­  
tion. hi* colloquial talents were not above rnedioc

of his career, civil and military, of which the his­  
tory ol the world furnishes no other example.—  
Mow, then, can it he perilous for you to take such  
a mail on your shoulders.1 I am satisfied the great  
body of Republicans think of him as 1 do. We  
were, indeed, dissatisfied with him on his ratiftca  
tiunot the British Treaty; but this was short-lived.  
Wo knew his honesty, the wiles with which lie  
was encompassed, and that age had already begun  
to relax the tiiimiessol his put jxises: anil ! am con­  
vinced he is more deeply seated iu the love and  
gratitude of the Republicans, than in the Pharisai­  
cal homage ol the Federal Monarchists. For ho  
was no monat^iist from preference of his judg­  
ment. 1 he soundness of that gave him correct  
views ol the rights of man, and his severe justice  
devoted him to them. II- h is often declared to me,  
that lie considered our new Constitution as an ex­  
periment on the practicability of republican gov  
eminent, ai.-i with what dose ol liberty man can be  
trusted liur his own good: that he was determined  
the experiment should have a fair trial, and would  
lo-&gt;e the last diop ot his lil&lt; od in suppoit of if._  
And these he repeated ionic the oftener, and more  
pointedly, because be know my suspicions of Col.  
Hamilton&#x27;s views, and probably had heard the de­  
clarations which I ban hoard, to wit_“that the  
British Constitution, w ith its unequal representa  
&#x27;jnn, corruption, and other existing abuses, was the  
ino-t perfect Government which had ev..i been es­  
tablished on earth, and that a reformation of these  
abuses would make it an impracticable Covetn­  
tnent.  
1 do believe that General Washington had not a  
| firm confidence in the durability of our Govern  
&quot;,,ls naturally distrustful of men, and  
i inclined to gloomy apprehensions; and 1 was ever  
persuaded that a telief that w o must at length end  
in something like a British Constitution had*some  
weight in his adoption ol the ceremonies of lovecs,  
birth-days, pompous meetings with Congress, and  
other forms of the same character, calculated to  
prepare us gradually for a change which he be­  
lieved possible, and so let it come on with as little  
shock as might he to the public mind. These are  
my opinions of Gen. Washington, w hich 1 would  
vouch at the judgment seat of God. having been  
formed on an acquaintance of 30 yeais. 1 serv d  
with him in the Virginia Legislature from 170&#x27;i) to  
tho Revolutionary war, and again a short time in  
Congress, until lie left us to lake command of the  
war. Muring the w ar, and after it, we correspond­  
ed occasionally, and in the.four years of my contin  
uance in the office of Secretary of State, our in­  
tercourse was daily, confidential, and cordial—  
After I retiicd from that office, great and tnaliir­  
  
11 it ii t pains wire taKcn by our rcuet&#x27;al monarchist&#x27;&#x27;,  
and unt entirely without effect, to make him view  
me us atheoiist, holding French piiuciples of go­  
vernment,which would lead infallibly to licentious­  
ness and anarchy. Ami to this he listened the  
more easily, from my known disapprobation of the  
British treaty. 1 never saw him afterwards, or

o antigfied the great body of Republicans  
1k ofdhim as 1 do—we were indeed dis­  
go&lt;fed wioo am on his ratification of the  
Yo 0 toeaty, but this was short lived.  
YW koew lis homesty, tha wiles with  
wiooh e was encompassed, and that age  
{; L already bogan to relax the firmuness of  
1s purposes: and 1 am convineed that he  
is wore deeply seatad in the love and grat.  
itude of the Repablicans, than in the pha­  
riswica! hoorge of the Federal Monarch­  
ists. For he was no monarchist from pre- |  
ference of his judgment. The soundness  
of that gave him correct views of the rights ‘  
of man, au! his envere justice devoted hinr,  
to them. Ie Las often declared to me  
that he eensidered onr new constitution as  
an experiment on the practicability of re- |  
publican government, and with what dose  
of liberty man conld be trusted for his own  
good; that he was determined the experi­  
twent shieuld have a fair trial, and would  
Jose the lust drop of his blood in support of  
it. Aud these he repeated to me the&#x27;often  
er, and the more pointedly, because he  
knew my suspicions of Col. Hamilton’s  
views, and probably had heard from him  
the same declarations which 1 had, to wit:  
“[&quot;hat the British constitution with its un­  
equnl representation, corruption, and other  
existing abuses, was the most perfect gov­  
crument which had ever been esteblished  
on earth, and that a reformation of these  
abuses would make it animpracticable go.  
vernment.,” Ido believe that Gen, Wash­  
ington had not a firm confidence in the  
durability ef our government. lle was  
paturally distrustful of men, and inclined  
to gloomy apprehignsions; and I was ever  
‘rcrsuml(‘al that a belief that we must at  
Teugth end in something ke a British  
Constitution had some weight in his adop  
tion of the ceremonies of levees, birth-days,  
pompons meetings with Congress, and oth­  
er forms of the same character, calculated  
to prepare us gradually fora change which  
he beheved possible, and so let it come on  
with ag little shock as might be to the  
public mind. —These are my opinions of  
Gen. Washington, which T would vouch at  
the julgment seat of God, having been  
formed on an acquaintapce of thirty years.  
Lsorved with him in the Virginia z«:gisla-1  
ture irom 1769 to the revolutionary war, |  
and again a shoX time in Congress until  
he left ue to take command of the army.  
During the war and after it, we corres­  
ponded occasionally, and in the fonr years  
of my continnance in the oflice of Secre­  
tary of State, our intercourse was daily,  
.confidential, and cordial. Atter I retired  
from that office, great and malignant  
pains were taken by our I&#x27;ederal monarch  
iste, and not entirely without effect, to  
make him view me as a theorist, halding  
¥reneh principles of - government which  
wonld lead infallibly to hicentionsness and  
anarchy, And tothis he listened the more  
easily from my known disapprobation of  
the Dritish treaty, I never saw him after  
wards, or these malignant insinuations  
should have been dissipated before his just  
judgment as mists before the sun, 1 fe&#x27;t  
on his death, withemy ecountrymen, that  
“verily a great mnan hath fallen this day in  
Israel.” :  
More time and recollection would enable  
me t #add many other traits of his eharac­  
ter; but why add them to yon who know  
them well? and [ cannot justify to myself  
a longer detention of your paper. Vale,

Dear sir: I deplore with you the putrid state into |  
which our newspapers have passed, and the malignity,  
the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those who write  
for them; and I enclose you a recent sample, the pro-  
duction of a New England judge, as a proof of the abyss  
of degradation into which we have fallen. These or-  
dures are rapidly depraving the public taste, and lessen-  
ing itsrelish for sound food. As vehicles of information,  
and a curb on our functionaries, they have rendered  
themselves useless, by forfeiting all titleto belief. That  
this has, in a great degree, been produced by the violence  
and moalignity of party spirit, l agree with you; and I  
have read with great pleasure the paper you enclosed  
me on that subject, which I now return. Itis, at the  
same time, a perfect model ef the style of discussion  
which candor and decency should observe, of the tone  
which renders difference of opinion even. amiable, and a  
succinct, correct, and dispassionate history of the origin  
and progress of party among us. It might be incorpo-  
rated, as it stands, and without changing a word, into the  
history of the present epoch, and would give to posteri-  
ty a fairer view of the times than they will probable de-  
rive from other sources. In reading it with great satis-  
faction, there was but a single passage where I wished a  
little more developement, of a very sound and catholic  
idea, a single intercalation to rest it solidly on true bot-  
tom. It is near the end of the first page, where you  
make a statement of genuine republican maxims, say-  
ing, ‘‘that the a ought to possess as much political  
power as can possibly consist with the order and seeurity  
of society.”” Instead ef this, | would say, “that the peo- |  
ple, being the only safe depository of power, should ex- |  
ercise, in person, every function which their qualifica- |  
tions enable them to exercise, consistently with the or- |  
der and security of society ; that we now find them equal ‘o |  
the election of those who shall be invested with their  
executive and legislative powers, and to act themselves  
in the judiciary, as judges im questions of fact; that the  
range of their powers ought to be enlarged,” ete, This  
gives both the reason and exemplification of the maxim  
you express, “that they ought to possess as much political  
  
ower,” &amp;e. I see nothing to correct either in your  
acts or principles. oa  
  
You say, that, in taking general Washington on your  
shoulders, to bear him harmless through the federal coa-  
lition, you encounter a perilous topic. 1 do not think so;  
you have given the genuine history of the course of his  
mind through the trying scenes in which it was engaged,  
and of the seduction by which it was deceived, but not  
depraved. I think 1 knew general Washington intimate-  
ly and thoroughls ; and were I called on to delineate his  
Are hony it should be in terms like these.  
» His mind was great and powerful, without being of  
the very first order; his penetration strong, though not  
so acute as that of a Newton, Bacon or Locke: and, as

far as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. It was  
slow in operation, being little aided by invention or ima-  
gination, but sure in conclusion. ence the common  
remark of his officers, of the advantage he derived from  
councils of war, where, hearing all suggestions, he se-  
lected’ whatever was best; and certainly no general ever  
planned his battles more judiciously. But, if cma  
during the course of the action, if any member of his  
plan was dislocated by sudden circumstanees, he was  
slow in re-adjustment. The consequence was, that he  
often failed in_the field, and rarely against an enemy in  
station, as at Boston and York. He was incapable of  
fear, meeting personal dangers with the calmest uncon-  
cern. Perhaps the strongest feature in his character was  
prudence, never acting until every circumstance, every  
consideration, was maturely weighed; refraining if he  
saw a doubt, but, when ence decided, going t rough  
with hts purpose, whatever obstacles opposed. His in-  
tegrity was most pure, his justice the most inflexible I  
h: ve ever known, no motives of interest or consanguini-  
ty, of friendship or hatred, being able to bias his decision.  
He was, indeed, in every sense of the word, a wise, a  
good, anda greatman. His temper was naturally irrita-  
ble and high toned: but reflection and resolution had ob-  
tained a firm and habitual ascendancy over it. If ever,  
however, it broke its bounds, he was most tremendous  
inhis wrath. In his expenses, he was honorable, but  
exact; liberal in contributions to whatever promised util-  
ity; but frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects,  
and all unworthy calls on his charity. His heart was not  
warm in its affections, but he exactly caleulated every  
man’s value, and gave him a solid esteem proportioned  
to it. His person, you know, was fine, his stature exact-  
iy what one would wish, his deportment easy, erect, and  
noble: the best horseman of his age, and the most grace-  
ful figure that could be seen on horseback. Although,  
in the circle of his friends, where he might be anreserv-  
ed with safety, he took a free share in conversation, his col-  
loquial talents were not above mediocrity, possessing  
neither copiousness of ideas, nor fluency of words. In  
public, when called on for a sudden opinion, he was une  
ready, short, and embarrassed. Yet he wrote readily,  
rather diffusely, in acorrect style. Thishe had acquired  
by conversation with the world: for his education was  
merely reading, writing, and common arithmetic, to  
which he added surveying at alater day. His time was  
employed in action chiefly, reading little, and that only  
in agriculture and English history. His correspondence  
became necessarily extensive, and, with journalising his  
agricultural proceedings, occupied most of his leisure  
hours within doors. On the whole, his character was,  
in its mass, perfect, in nothing bad, in few points indiffe-  
rent; and it may truly be said, that never did nature and  
fortune combine more pertectly to make a man great-  
and to place him in the same constellation with what-  
ever worthies have merited from man an everlasting re-  
membrance. For his was the singular destiny and merit  
of leading the armies of his country successfully through  
an arduous war, for the establishment of its independence,  
of conducting its councils through the birth of a govern-  
ment, new in its forms and principles, uutil it had settled  
down in a quiet and orderly train, and of serupulously  
obeying the laws through the whole of his career, civil  
and military, of which the history of the world furnishes  
no other example. How thenecan it be perilous for you  
to take such a man on your shoulders? I am satisfied  
the great body of republicans think of him as Ido. We  
  
| were, indeed dissatisfied with him on his ratification of  
  
the British treaty; but this was short-lived. We knew  
his honesty, the wiles with which he was encompassed,  
and that age had already begun to relax the firmness of  
his purposes, and I am convinced he is more deeply  
seated in the love and gratitude of the republicans, than  
in the pharisaical homage of the federal monarchists.  
For he was no movarchist from preference of his judg-  
ment. ‘The soundness of that gave him correct views of  
the rights of man, ane his severe justice devoted him to  
them. He has often declared to me, that he considered  
our new constitution as an experiment on the practicabil-  
ity of republican government, and with what dose of  
of liberty man ean be trusted for his own good: that he  
was determined the experiment should have a fair trial,  
and would lose the last drop of his blood in support of it.

I do believe that gen. Washington had nota firm con-  
fidence in the durability of our government. He was  
naturally distrustful of men, and inclined to gloomy ap-  
prehensions; and I was ever persuaded that a belief that  
we must at length end in something like a British con-  
stitution, had some weight in his adoption of the ceremo-  
nies of levees, birth days, pompous meetings with con-  
gress, and other forms of the same character, calculated  
to —_. us gradually fora change which he believed  
possible, and so let it come on with as little shock as  
might be to the public mind, These are my opinions of  
gen. Washington, which I would vouch at the judgment  
seat of God, having been formed on an acquaintance of 30  
  
ears. I served with him in the Virginia legislature  
rom 1769 to the revolutionary war, and again a short  
time in congress, until he left us to take command of the  
army, during the war, and after it, we corresponded oc-  
casionally, and in the four years of my continuance in  
the office of secretary of state, our intercourse was  
daily, confidential, and cordial. After I retired from that  
office, great and malignant pains were taken by our fe-  
deral monarchists, and not entirely without effect, to  
make him view meas a theorist, holding French princi-  
ples of government, which would lead infallibly to licen-  
tiousness and anarchy. And to this he listened the  
more easily, from my known disapprobation of the Bri-  
tish treaty. I never saw him afterwards, or these malig-  
nant insinuations should have been dissipated before his  
just jadgment, as mists before the sun. I felt, on his  
death, with my countrymen, that ‘‘verily a great man  
hath fallen this dav in Israel. ”  
  
More time and recollection would enable me to add  
many other traits of his character; but why add them to  
you who know them’well? and I cannot justify to myself  
a longer detention of your paper. Vale, propriaque  
tuum, me esse tibi persuadeas. TH. JEFFERSON

A CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON, BY PRESIDENT JEFFERSON,  
  
His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first order ;  
his penetration strong, though not so acute as that of a Newton, Bacon, or  
Locke, and, as far as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. It was slow  
in operation, being little aided by invention or imagination, but sure in con-  
clusion. Hence the common remark of his officers, of the advantage he de-  
rived from councils of war, where, hearing all suggestions, he selected what-  
ever was best; and certainly no general ever planned his battles more  
judiciously. But if deranged during the course of the action, if any member  
of his plan was dislocated by sudden circumstances, he was slow in re-adjust-  
ment. The consequence was, that he often failed in the field, and rarely  
against an enemy in station, as at Boston and York. He was incapable of  
fear, meeting personal danger with the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the  
strongest feature in his character was prudence, never acting until every  
circumstance, every consideration, was maturely weighed ; refraining if he  
saw a doubt, but when once decided, going through with his purpose, what-  
ever obstacles opposed. His integrity was most pure, his justice the most  
inflexible | have ever known; no motives of interest or consanguinity, of  
friendship or hatred, being able to bias his decision. He was, indeed, in  
every sense of the word, a wise, a good, and a great man. His temper was  
naturally irritable and high-toned ; but reflection and resolution had obtained  
a firm and habitual ascendancy over it. If ever, however, it broke its bounds,  
he was most tremendous injhis wrath. In his expenses he was honour-  
able, but exact; liberal in contributions to whatever promised utility ; but  
frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects, and all unworthy calls  
on his charity. His heart was not om in its affections; but he exactly  
calculated every man’s value, and gave him a solid esteem proportionate to it.  
His person, you know, was fine, his stature exactly what one would wish ;  
his deportment easy, erect, and noble; the best horseman of his age,  
and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback. Although,  
in the circle of his friends, where he might be unreserved with safety, he  
took a free share in conversation, his colloquial talents were not above  
mediocrity, possessing neither copiousness of ideas, nor fluency of words.  
In public, when called on for a sudden opinion, he was unready, short, and  
embarrassed, Yet he wrote readily, rather diffusely, in a correct style.  
This he had acquired by conversation with the world: for his education was  
merely reading, writing and common arithmetic, to which he added sur-  
veying ata later day. His time was employed in action chiefly, reading  
little, and that only in agriculture and English history. His correspon-  
dence became necessarily extensive, and, with journalizing his agricultural  
proceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within doors. On the  
whole, his character was, in its mass, perfect, in nothing bad, in few points  
indifferent ; and it may truly be said, that never did nature and fortune  
combine more perfectly to make a man great, and to place him in the same  
constellation with the .°rthies who have merited from man an everlasting  
remembrance. For his was the singular destiny and merit of leading the  
armies of his country snecessfully through an arduous war, for the establish-  
ment of its independence—of conducting its councils through the birth of a  
government, new in its forms and principles, until it had settled down in  
a quiet and orderly train—and of scrupulously obeying the laws through the  
whole of his career, civil and military, of which the history of the world  
furnishes no other example. How, then, can it be perilous {fcr you to take  
such a man on your shoulders? I am satisfied that the great body of re-  
publicans think of him as I do. We were, indeed, dissatisfied with him on  
his ratification of the British treaty ; but this was short lived. We knew  
his honesty, the wiles with which he was encompassed, and that age  
had already began to relax the firmness of his purposes; and I am  
convinced that he is more deeply seated in the love and gratitude of the  
republicans, than in the pharisaical homage of the federal monarchists. For  
he was no monarchist from preference of his judgment. The soundness of  
that gave him correct views of the rights of man, and his severe justice  
devoted him to them. He has often declared to me, that he considered our  
new constitution as an experiment on the practicability of republican go-  
vernment, and with what dose of liberty man can be trusted for his own  
good; that he was determined the experiment should have a fair trial, and  
would lose the last drop of his blood in support of it. And these he re-  
peated to me the oftener and more pointedly, because he’knew my suspicions  
of Colonel Hamilton’s views, and probably had heard the declarations which  
I had heard, to wit,—* that the British constitution, with its unequal repre-  
sentation, corruption, and other abuses, was the most perfect government  
which had ever been established on earth, and that a reformation of those  
abuses would make it an impracticable government.” I do believe that  
General Washington had not a firm confidence in the durability of our go-  
vernment, He was naturally distrustful of men, and inclined to gloomy  
apprehensions ; and I was ever persuaded that a belief that we must at length  
end in something like a British constitution had some weight in his adoption  
of the ceremonies of levees, birth-days, pompous meetings with congress,  
and other forms of the same character, calculated to prepare us gradually  
for a change which he believed possible, and so let it come on with as little  
shock as might be to the public mind. These are my opinions of General  
Washington, which I would vouch at the judgment seat of God, having been

Dear Sir: I deplore with you  
the putrid state into which our  
newspapers have passed, and the  
malignity, the vulgarity, and men­  
dacious spirit of those who write  
for them; and I enclose you a re­

dures are rapidly depraving the  
public taste, and lessening its re-  
  
llish for sound food. As vehicles  
  
of information, and a curb on our  
  
functionaries, they have rendered  
themselves useless, by forfeiting  
all title to belief. That this has,  
in a great degree, been produced  
  
by the violence and malignity of  
  
party spirit, 1 agree with you; and  
I have read with great pleasure

through the trying scenes in wmcn  
it was engaged, and of the seduc­

These are my opinions of Gen.  
Washington, which I would vouch

with him in the Virginia Legisla­

ary war, and again a short time  
in Congress, until he left us to  
take command of the army. Du­

responded occasionally, and in  
the four years of my continuance  
in the office of Secretary of State,  
our intercourse was daily, confi­

Dear Sir—l deplore with you the putrid state  
into which our newspapers have passed, and the  
malignity, the vulgarity, and MENDACIOUS Spirit of  
those who write for them ; and I enclose you are­  
eent sample, the production of a New-England  
judge, as a proof of the abyss of degradation into  
which we have fallen. These ordures are ra­  
pidly depraving the public taste, and lessening  
its relish for sound food. As vehicles of tniorma­  
tion, and a curb on our functioncries they have  
rendered themselves useless by forfeiting all  
title to belief. That this-has in a great degree  
been- produced by the violence and malignity of  
party spirit 1 agree with you; and 1 have read  
with great pleasure the paper you enclosed me  
on the subject which I now return, It is amthe  
same time a perfect model of the style of  
discussion which candor and decency should  
cbserve, of the .tone which renders difference of  
opinion even amiable, and a succinct, correct,  
and dispassionate history of the origin and pro­  
gress of party among us. It might be incorpor­  
ated as it stands, and without changing a word,  
into the history of the present efpoch and would  
give to posterity a fairer view of the times than -  
they will probably derive from other sources.  
In reading it with great satisfaction there was |  
bat a single passage where I wished a little more  
developement of a very sound and catholic idea,  
a single intercalation to rest it solidly on true  
bottom. Itis near the end ofthe Ist page, where ‘  
you make a statement of genuine- republican  
maxims ; saying ‘“that the people ought to possess ‘  
as much political power as can possibly consist with |  
the order and security of society.” Instead of this  
I would say “that the people being the oNLY sA¥E  
DEPOSITORY OF POWER, should EXERCISE IN PER-  
SoN every function which their qualifications enable  
them to exercise consisténtly with the order and se­  
curity of society ; that we now find them _ciual to  
the election of those who shall be invested with their  
executive and legislative powers. and to act them­  
selves in the judiciary, as judges in questions of fact;  
that the RANGE OF THEIR POWERS OUGHT TO BE  
ENLARGED, ect.”” This gives both the reason and  
exemplification of the maxim you express ‘‘that  
they oughtto possess as much polical power, &amp;c.”  
I see nothing to correct either in your facts or  
principle. o ‘  
You say that in taking Gen. Washington on  
your shoulders, to bear him harmless through  
the federal Coalition, you encounter a perilous  
topic. Ido not think&#x27;so ; you h_ave_ given the  
genuine history of the course of his mind through  
the trying scenes in which it was engaged, and  
of the seductions by which it was deceived, but  
not depraved. 1 think I knew Gen. Washing­  
ton intimately and thoroughly ; and were I called  
on to delineate his character it should be in terms  
like these.  
[His mind was greatand powerful, without be­  
ing of the very first order ; his penetration strong,  
through not so acute as that ofp a Nowton, Bacom,  
  
PORTSR.OUITE,  
  
j or Locke ; and as far as he gaw, no judgment  
y Was ever sounder, It was slow in opuration, be­  
| ing little aided by invention or imagination, but  
{ sure in conelusion. Henge the couunon remark  
| of his officers, of the advantage he derived fro:mn  
| councils of war, where hearing ail suggestions,  
i h‘e selected whatever was best ; and eertainly no  
| General ever planned his battles more Judicious­  
ly. But if deranged during the course of the  
action, if any meriber of hig plan was dislocated  
by sudden circumstances, he was slow in re-ud-  
Justment. The consequence was that he often  
failed in the field, and rarely agajnst an enemy  
in station, as at Boston and York. ile was in­  
capable of fear, mecting personal dangers with  
the calinest’ unconcern, Perhaps the strongest  
feature in his character was prudence, never  
acting until every circuinstance, every consider­  
- ation was maturely weighed ; reiraining if he saw  
a doubt, but, when once decided, going through  
with his purpose whatever obstacles opposed.—  
His integrity was most pure, his Jjustice the most  
inflexible I&#x27;have ever known, no miotives of in­  
| terest or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred,  
i being able to bias his decision. He was, indeed,  
lin @very sonss of the vord, a wise, 200 G, and  
{ @ rreet maa. His temper was naturaily irrita­  
ble and high toned ; but reflection and resolution  
i had obtained a firm and habitual ascendency  
{ overit. If ever however it _broke its bonds,  
;he was most tremendous in his wrath. I_n his  
! expenses he was honorable, but exact; liberal  
in contributions to whatever promised utility ;  
{ but frowing and unyielding on all visionary pro­  
| jects and all unworthy calls on his charity. His  
heart was not warm in its affections ; but he ex­  
actly calculated every man’s value, and gave him  
. @ solid esteem proportioned to it. His person,  
‘ you know, was fine, his stature exactly what one  
  
{ would wish, his deportnient easy, erect, and no­  
| ble ; the best horseman of his age, and the most  
l graceful figure that could be seen on horseback.  
Although in the circle of his friends, where he  
might be unreserved with safety, he took a free  
share in conversation, his colloquial talents were  
not above mediocrity, possessing neither copi­  
| ousness of ideas, nor fluency of words. In pub­  
lic when calied on for a sudden opinion, he was  
unready, short, and embarrassed. Yet he wrote  
i readily, rather diffusely, in a correct style.—  
This he had acquired by conversation with the  
world, for his education was merely reading,  
writing, and common arithmetic, to which he  
added surveying at a later day. His time was  
employed iu action chiefly, reading little, and  
that only in agriculture and English History.—  
His correspondence bécame necessarily exten­  
sive, and with journalizing his agriculiural pro­  
i ceedings, ,occupied most of his leisure hours  
| within doors. On the whole, his character was,  
&#x27; in its mass perfeet, in nothing bad, in few peints  
indifferent ; and it may truly be said that never  
l did na‘ture and fortune combine more perfectly  
to make a man great, and to placé him in the  
{ same constellation with whatever worthies have  
merited from an and everlasting remembrance.  
For his was the singular destiny and merit of  
leading the armies of his country successfully  
threugh an arduous war, for the establishment  
of its independence, of conducting its councils  
through the birth of a government, new in its  
forms and principles until it hus settled down in  
a quiet and orderly train, and of scrupulously  
cbeying the laws through the whole of his ca­  
reer, civil and military, of which the history of  
the world furnishes ne other examnple.]

How then can it be perilous for you to take such  
a man on your shoulders ? I am satisfied the great  
body of Republicans think of&#x27; him as I do—we  
were indeed dissatisfied with him on his ratifi­  
cation of the British treaty, but this was short  
lived. We kuew his honesty, the wiles with  
which he was encompassed, and that aze had al­  
ready begun to relax the firmness of Lis purpos­  
es and I am convinced that he is more deeply seat­  
ed in the LOVE AND GRATITUDE OF THE REPUBLI­  
CANS, THAN IN THE PHARISAICAL HOMAGE OF THE  
FEDERAL MONARCHISTS. For he was no monar­  
chists from preference of his judgment. The  
soundness of that gave him correct vicws of the ‘  
Tights of man and this SEVERE JUSTICE DEVOTED  
HIM 7o THEM. He has often declared to me that  
&#x27; he considered our new constitution as an experi­  
ment on the practicability of republican govern­  
- ment, and with what dose of liberty man could  
be trusted for his own good: that he was deter­  
mined the experiment should have a fair trial, and |  
would lose the LAST DROP OF HIS BLOOD IN SUP- |  
- PorT 0F IT. And these he repeated to me the  
oftener, and the more pointedly, because he knew 1  
my suspicioNs oF CorL. Hamivtons’s views, and  
probably had heard from him the same declara­  
tions which I had, to wit:—“Tuat THE BRITISH  
CONSTITUTION with ils UNEQUAL REPRESENTA­  
TION, CORRUPTION AND OTHER EXISTING ARUSES  
WAS THE MCST PERFECT GOVERNMENT WHICH  
HAD EVER BEEN LSTAEUISHED ON EARTH,and that  
A REFCRMATION OF THESE ABUSES would malke it  
an IMPRACTICABLE GOVERNMENT.” 1 dg believe  
that Gen. Washington had not a firm cunj?a’ence mn  
the durability of our government. He was natu­  
rally distrustful of men, and inclined to gloomy  
aprrehensions ; and I was ever persuaded that a |  
belicf that we must at length end in something like  
&amp; Bririsu Constiturion had some weight in his  
adoption of the ceremonies of LEVEES, BIRTH DAYS  
POMPOUS MEETINGS WITH CoNGREss, and other  
Jorms of the same character, calculated to prepare  
us gmdua,lllzi for a change which he belicved possi­  
ble, and so let it come on with as little shock as  
might be to the public mind.—These are mdy opin­  
ions of Gen. Washington, which I would vouch  
at the judgment seat of God, havinf been formed  
on an acquaintance of 30 years. served with  
him in the Virginia Legislature from 1769 to the

responded occasionalfl%r, and in the 4 years of my  
continuance in the office of Secretary of State,  
our intercourse was daily, confidential and cor­  
dial. After I retired from that office GREAT AND  
MALIGNANT PAINS were taken by our FEDERAL  
MONARCHISTS, and not entircly without effect, ta  
make him view me as « THEORIST holding FRENCH  
PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT which would lead in-  
Jallibly to LIcENTIOUSNESS and ANARCHY. And tq  
this hie listened the more easily from my known  
disapprobation of the British treaty. [ mnever saw

A CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON,  
—  
BY PRESIDENT JOPFERSON,  
  
His mind was geeat and powerful, without being of the  
very first order; his penetratien strong, though not so  
acute as that of a Newton, Bacon, or Locke; aid, as far  
as he saw, no judyment was ever sounder. It was slow in  
| operation, being litle aided by invention or imagination,  
but sure in conclusion. Hence the common remark of his  
officers, of the advantage he derived from councils of war,  
where, hearing all suggestions, he seiected whatever was  
best; and, certainly, no general ever planned his battles  
more judiciously. But if deranged during the course of  
the action, if any member of his plan was dislocated by  
sudden circumstances, he was slow in re-adjustment. The  
consequence was, that he often failed in the field, and  
rarely against an enemy in station, as at Boston and York.  
He was incapable of fear, meeting personal danger with  
the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the strongest feature in  
his character was prudence, never acting until every cir-  
cumstance, every consideration, was maturely weighed ;  
refraining if he saw adoubt, but when once decided, going  
through with his purpose, whatever obstacles opposed.  
His integrity was most pure, his justice the most inflexible  
I have ever known; no motives of interest or consan-  
guinity, of friendship or hatred, being able to bias his  
decision. He was, indeed, in every sense of the word, a  
wise, a good, anda great man. His temper was naturally  
irritable and high-toned ; but reflection and resolution bad  
obtained a firm and habitual ascendancy over it. If ever,  
however, it broke its bounds, he was most tremendous in  
his wrath. In his expenses he was honourable, but exact;  
liberal in contiibutions to whatever promised utility ; but  
frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects, and  
all unworthy callson his charity. H&#x27;sheart was not warm  
in its affections; but he exaetly calculated every man’s  
value, and gave him a solid esteem pxpportionate to it.—  
His person, you know, was fine; his stature exactly what  
one would wish ; his deportment easy, egect, and noble ;  
the best horseman of his age, and the most graceful figure  
that could be seen on horseback: Although, in the circle  
of his friends, where he might be oes with safety,  
he took a free share in conversation, his colloquial talents  
were not above mediocrity, possessing neither copiousness  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
of ideas, nor fluency of words. In public, when called on  
for a sudden opinion, he was unready, short, and embar-  
rassed. Yet he wrote readily, rather diffusely, in a correct  
style. This he had acquired by conversation with the  
world ; for his education was merely reading, writing, and  
common arithmetic, to which he added surveying, at a later  
day. His time was employed in action chiefly, reading  
little, and that only in agriculture, and English history.  
His correspondence became necessarily extensive, and,  
with journalizing his agricultural proceedings, occupied  
most of his leisure hours within doors. On the whole, his  
character was, in its mass, perfect, in sothing bad, in few  
points indifferent; and it may be truly said, that never  
did nature and fortune combine more perfectly to make a  
man great, and to place him in the same constellation with  
the worthies who have merited from man an everlasting  
remembrance. For his was the singular destiny and merit  
of leading the armies of his country successfully through  
an arduous war, for the establishment of its independence  
—of conducting its councils through the birth of a go.  
vernment, new in its forms and principles, until it had  
settled down in a quiet and orderly train—and of scru-  
pulously obeying the laws through the whole of his career,  
civil and military, of which the history of the world fur-  
nishes no other example. How, then, can it be perilous  
for you to take such a man on your shoulders ? IT am sa-  
tisfied that the great body of republicans think of him as  
do, We were, indecd, dissatisfied with him on his rati-  
fication of the British treaty; but this was short lived.  
We knew his honesty, the wiles with which he was en-  
compassed, and that age had already begun to relax the  
firmness of his purposes; and I am convinced that he is  
inore deeply seated in the love and gratitude of the re-  
publicans than in the pharisaical homage of the federal  
monarchists. For he was no monarchist from preference  
of his judgment: the soundness of that gave him correct  
views of the rights of man, and his severe justice devoted  
him totbem. He has often declared to me, that he con-  
sidered our pew constitution as an experiment on the prac-  
ticability of republican government, and with what dose  
of liberty man can be trusted for his own good ; that he  
was determined the experiment should have a fair trial,  
and would lose the last drop of his blocd in support of it.  
And these he repeated to me the oftener and more point-  
edly because he knew my suspicions of Colonel Hamiulton’s  
views, and, probably, had heard the declarations which I  
had heard, to wit,-—‘* that the British Constitution, with  
its unequal representation, corruption, and other abuses,  
was the most pertect government which had ever been  
established on earth, and that a reformation of those  
abuses would make it an impracticable government.” Ido  
believe that General Washington had nota firm confidence  
in the durability of our government. He was, naturally,  
distrustful of men, and inclined to gloomy apprehensions ;  
and I was ever persuaded that a belief, that we must, at  
length, end in something lixe a British constitution, had  
come weight in his adoption of the ceremonies of levees,  
birthdays, pompous meetings with Congress, and other  
forms of the same character, calculated to prepare us gra-  
dually for a change, which he believed possible, and so let  
it come on with as little shock as might be to the public  
mind. These are my opinions of General Washington,

## [CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/2191596)

#### From _The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser (NSW : 1803 - 1842)_

Jefferson.J His mind w,.is great and  
powerful, with-out being of the very  
first order ; his pene-tration strong,  
though not só acute as that of a Newton,  
Bacon, or Licke ; and, its far, as he  
saw, no judgment was ever sounder It was  
al iw in operation, being little aided  
by invention or imagination, but sure  
in, conclusion.-Hence the common re in  
ark of his officers, of the advantage he  
arrived from Councils of War, where,  
hearing a! suggestions, lie  
stlected.whitever was best; and  
certainly no General ever planned his  
biltles more judiciously. But if  
deranged during the couise of the  
action, if any&#x27; momber of his plan was  
dislocated by sud-den circumstances, he  
was slow in re-ad-justment. The  
consequence was, that&#x27; he often failed  
in the field, and rarely against an  
enemy in slati m, as at Boston ami Yoik.  
He was incapable of fear, meeting  
personal dangers with the calmest  
unconcern. Per-haps the strongest  
featur* in his character was prudence,  
never acting until eviry cir-cumstance,  
every consideration, was ma-tu rely  
weighed; refraining if hesawadoubt, but  
when once decided, going through with  
his purpose, whatever obstacles opposed.  
His integrity was most pine, his justice  
the most inflexible I have ever known;  
no motives of interest or consanguinity,  
of fi ¡.Midship or hatted, being able to  
bias his decision. He was, indeed, in  
every sense of the wortl, a wise, a  
good, and a givat mun. His temper was  
naturally irritable and high toned ; but  
reflection and resolution had obtained a  
firm and habitual ascendancy over it. If  
ever, ^imvever, it broke its bounds, he  
was most tremendous in his wrath. lu his  
ex pence s he was honourable, but exact  
; Iib-ral in contributions of what-ever  
promised utility ; but frowning and  
unyielding on all visionary project«*,  
audall uuwoithy calls on his charity.  
His heart was not warm in its affe-  
ctions ; but he ex-actly calculated  
every &#x27;man&#x27;s vdue, and gave him a solid  
e teeni proportionate to it. His  
per»o:i, you kno»v, was line, his  
slaiute exactly what one would wish ;  
his deport-ment easy, erect and noble;  
the best hotseman of his age, and the  
mo»t graceful figure that could bciSe-  
non lioisjback. Although in the circle  
of his fiieuds where he might he  
unreserved viith_süfety, he took a fren  
share in conversation, his colloq ita!  
talents were not above uicdióer&#x27;ly,  
p^ssei-ssing nei-ther copiousness of  
idea, nor influence of words. In.  
public, when called on lora sudden  
opinion, he Was unready; shott, and  
embarrassed. Y&gt; the wrote readily,  
rather diffusely, it» a correct style.  
This ha had acquired by conversation  
with the wot Id : for Ins education was  
me i ely, reading, wri-&#x27; ting, and  
common a - itliiiietic, to winch he add«  
d surveying,at a later day. Mistime was  
employed m action chiefly, retidin«;  
little, and that only in agriculture und  
Eng-lish history. His correspondence  
became nefce.-sarily «xteiisive,and,  
willi journalizing his i.gricultnral  
proceedings, occupied most of Ins  
leisure h mrs within doors. On the whole  
his character was, in its mass, per-  
fect, in nothing bad, in few points  
indiffer-ent.; and it may truly be sud,  
that never did nature and fortune  
combine more per-fectly to make a in..n  
great, and to place him in the same  
constellation wth the worthies who have  
merited from mm au everlasting  
remembrance. For his w.s the singular  
destiny anti merit of leading the armies  
of Ins country successfully through an  
arduous war, for the establishment of  
its independence-of conducting its  
councils through the biit&#x27;i of a Govern-  
ment, new in its forms.and piinciples,  
until it had settled do vu in a quie and  
orderly train-and of scrupulously  
obeying the laws tbr.ugh the whole ol&#x27;  
his carear, eiv.il a&#x27;id milit»ry,  
ol&#x27;which the history ot the world  
furnishes no other example. How then can  
it be p-rilous for you to take such a  
man cn your shoulders? I am satisfied  
that the great body of Republicans think  
of him as I do. We were, indee I,  
dissatisfied with him on his  
ratification of the Brit sh Treaty; but  
this was shot t lived. We knew his  
honesty, the wile»» with which he was  
encompa--se&#x27;l, aüd that age had already  
be-gan to relax tho firmness of hi?  
purposes ; and I am convince I.that he  
is moro deeply seated in the love and  
gratitude of the Re-publican-, than in  
the Puarasaical homage of the Federal  
Monarchists. For he was no monarchist  
from preference in his judgment. The  
soundness of that gave lum coirect views  
of the rights of man, and . 1rs severe  
ju&gt;.t ce devoted hint to tne.n. He has  
often declared to me, that he considered  
our new Con.titutio:i asan experiment on  
the practi-cability ol&#x27; &#x27;.Republican  
Government, an-l with what dose ol&#x27;  
liberty mau can be trusted for his oivn  
good ; that he was determined the  
experiment-should li ive a fair trial,  
and would lose the last drop of his  
blood in sup&#x27; port ol&#x27; if. &#x27; And these  
he &quot;repeated to me the oftenor and mord  
pointedly, because Ile knew my  
suspicions of Colonel Hamilton&#x27;s views,  
un ii probably had heard the declara-  
tions which I had Lfiird, to wit-&quot; that  
the British Constitution, with its  
unequal repre-sentation, corrup.ion, and  
other nouses, was the most perfect

justice devoted him to them. He has often declared to me, that he consi-  
dered our new constitution as an experiment on the practicability of re.  
publican government, and with what dose of liberty man could be trusted

“that the British Constitution, with its unequal representation, corruption,

Washington had not a firm confidence in the durability of our govern-

prehensions; and | was ever persuaded, that a belief that we must at  
length end in something like a British Constitution, had some weight in  
his adoption of the ceremonies of levees, birth-days, pompous meetings  
with Congress, and other forms of the same character, calculated to prepare  
us gradually for a change which he believed possible, and to let it come

CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON. —I think I knew General

His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very

during tne course of the action, if any member of his plan was dislo-  
cated by sudden circumstances, he was slow in a readjusiment. The  
  
isequence Was, that he often failed in the field, and rarely against

« He was no monarchist from preference of  
his judgment. The soundness of that gave  
him correct views of the rights of man, and  
his severe justice devoted him tothem. He  
has often declared to me, that he considered  
our new constitution as an experiment on the  
practicability of republican government, and  
with what dose of liberty man could be trust-

me the oftener and the more pointedly, be-

ilton’s views, and probably had heard from him  
the same declarations which I had, to wit,  
‘that the British Constitution, with its unequal  
representation, corruption, and other existing  
abuses, was the most perfeet government  
whieh had ever been established on earth, and  
that a reformation of these abuses would make  
itan impracticable government. I do believe  
that General Washington had not a firm con-  
  
He was naturally distrustful of men, and in-  
clined to gloomy apprehensions; and I was  
ever persuaded, that a belief that we must at  
length eud in something like a British Consti-  
tution, had some weight in his adoption of the  
ceremonies of levees, birth-days, pompous  
meetings with Congress, and other forms of  
the same character, calculated to prepare us  
gradually for a change which, he believed pos-  
sible, and to let it come on with as little shock  
as might be to the public mind.”—vol. iv. pp.

the love and gratitude of the republicans,

deral monarchists. For he was no mon-

suspicions of Colonel Hamilton’s views,  
and probably had heard from him the  
same declarations which I had; to wit,  
‘that the British constitution, with its  
unequal representation, corruption, and  
other existing abuses, was the most per-  
fect government which had ever been es-  
tablished on earth, and that a reforma-

ful of men, and incl ned to gloomy appre-

a belief that we must at length end in

some weight in his adoption of the cere-  
monies of levees, birth-days, pompous  
meetings with Congress, and other forms  
of the same character, calculated to pre-  
pare us gradually for a change which he  
believed possible, and to let it come on

GENERAL WASHINGTON.  
  
. Iw the memoirs of Thomas Jefferson, late President of the  
United States, recently published, we are presented with the  
following estimate of the character of General Washington :  
—** His mind was great and powerful, without being of the  
first order ; his penetration strong, though not so acute as  
that of a Newton, Bacon, or Locke; and, as far as he saw,  
no judgment was ever sounder. It was slow in operation.  
being little aided by invention or imagination, but sure in  
conclusion, Hence the common remark of his officers of the  
advantage he derived from councils of war, where, hearing  
all suggestions, he selected whatever was best ; and certainly  
no general ever planned his battles more judiciously. He  
was incapable of fear, meeting personal dangers with the  
¢almest unconcern. Perhaps the strongest feature tn his  
eharacter was prudence, never acting until every circumstance,  
every ideration, was. maturely weighed ; refraining, il  
be saw a doubt, but, when once decided, going through  
with his purpose, whatever obstacles o His integrity  
was most pure, his justice the most inflexible I had eve  
known ; no motives of interest or consanguinity of 7  
  
er hatred, being able to bias his decision. He was, 1  
tm every sense of the words, a wise, a good, and a tman. |  
His temper was naturally irritable and high-toned ; but re-  
  
fiction and resolution had obtained a firm and habitual  
ascendancy over it.  
most tremendous in his wrath. In his expenses he war  
honourable, but exact; liberal in contributions to whatever  
promised utility ; but frowning and unyielding on all vision-  
ary projects, and all unworthy calls on his charity. His  
heart was not warm in its affections ; but he exactly calcu-  
lated every man&#x27;s value, and gave him asolid esteem propor-  
tioned to it. His person, you know, was fine, his stature  
exactly what one would wish, his deportment easy, erect, and  
noble ; the best horseman of his age, and the most graceful  
figure that could be seen on horseback. Although in the circle  
of his friends, where he might be unreserved with safety, he  
took a free share in conversation, his colloquial talents were  
not above mediocrity, possessing neither copiousness of ideas,  
nor fluency of words. Ln public, when called on for a suiden  
Opinion, he was unready, short, and embarrassed. Yet he  
wrote readily, rather diffusely, in an easy and correct style.  
This he had acquired by conversation with the world, for his  
education was merely reading, writing, and common arith-  
metic, to which he added surveying ata later day. His time  
teas employed in action chiefly, reading little, and that only in  
agriculture and English history, His correspondence became  
ner essarily extensive, and, with journalizing his agricultural]  
proceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within doors.  
On. the whole, his character was, in its mass, perfect, in no-  
thing bad, in few points indifferent; and it may truly be  
said, that never did nature and fortunecombine more perfectly  
to make a man great, and to place him in the same constel-  
lation with whatever worthies have merited from man an  
everlasting remembrance. For his was the singular destiny  
aud merit, of leading the armies of his country successfully  
through an arduous war, for the establishment of its inde-  
  
pendence ; of quninetng its councils, through the birth of 3 |  
°  
  
government, new in its forms and principles, until it had  
settled down into a quiet and orderly train; and of scrupu-  
lously obeying the laws through the whole of his career, civil  
  
and military, of which the history of the world furnishes no |

## [CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON. BY JEFFERSON.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/12845722)

#### From _The Sydney Herald (NSW : 1831 - 1842)_

#### 1832-11-15 &middot; [Sydney, New South Wales](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sydney)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON. BY JEFFERSON.  
His mind was great and powerful, without  
be-ing of the very first order ; his  
penetiation strong, though not so acute  
as that of a Newton, Bacon, or, Locke&quot;;  
and, as far as he saw, no judgment was  
ever sounder. It was slow in operation,  
being little aided by invention or  
imagination, but sure in consultation,  
Hence&#x27; the common remark of liis  
officers, of the advantage he derived  
from councils of war, where hearing all  
suggestions, he selected whatever was  
best ; and -certainly no general ever  
planned his battles moro judiciously.  
But if deranged during the course of the  
action, if any member of his plan was  
dislocated by sud-den circumstances, he  
was slow in re-adjustment. The  
consequence was, that he often failed in  
the field, and rarely against au enemy  
in station, as at Boston and York. He  
was incapable of fear, meeting personal  
dangers with the calmest uncon-cern.  
Perhaps tho strongest feature in his  
character was prudence, never acting  
until every circumstance, every  
consideration, was maturely weighed ;  
refraining if ho saw a doubt, but when  
once decided, going through with his  
purpose, whatever obstacles opposed. His  
integrity was most pure, his justice the  
most inflexible I have ever known, no  
motive of interest or consanguinity  
being able to bias his opinions-He wus  
indeed, ia every sense of the word, a  
wise, a good, and a great . man. His  
temper was naturally irritable and high  
toned ; but reflection and resolution  
had obtained a firm and habitual  
ascendancy over it. If over, however, it  
broke its bounds, he was most tremendous  
in his wrath. In his expenses, he was  
honourable, but exact ;-liberal in  
contribution to whatever promised  
utility ; but frowning and un-yielding  
on all visionary projects and all  
unworthycalls on his chaaity. His heart  
was not warm in its affections, but he  
exactly calculated every man&#x27;s value,  
and gave him a solid esteem  
proportionate to it; His person, you  
know, was fine, erect, mid noble ; the  
best horseman of his agc, and the most  
graceful figure that could be seen on  
horseback. Although in the circle of his  
friends where he might be unreserved  
with safety, he took a free share in  
conversation, his colloquial talents  
were not ebovi mediocrity, pdwétslng  
neither copiousness of idea« not Jnicncy  
of words. In public, when called on for  
sudden opinion, he was unready, .short  
and embarrasse/!. .Yet ho wrote readily,  
rather dif-fusely, and in a correct  
style. This he acquired by conversation  
with the world ; for his education was  
merely reading, writing, and common  
arithme-tic, to which he added surveying  
at a later day. His time was employed in  
action chiefly, reading little, and that  
only in agriculture and English history.  
His correspondence became necessarily  
extensive, and, with journalizing his&quot;  
agricultural proceedings, occupied most  
of his, leasure hours within doors. On  
the v\ hole, his character was in its  
mass perfect j in nothing bad, in Í6w  
points in-different ; and it may he  
truly said, that never did nature and  
fortune combine more perfectly to make a  
great man, and to place him in the same  
constel-lation with wliatavor worthies  
have merited from man, an everlasting  
remembrance. For his was , tlie singular  
destiny and merit of leading the armies  
of his country successfully through an  
ardu&#x27; ous war, for the establishment of  
its independence, of conducting  
itstoundls through the birth of a  
government, new in its forms and  
principles, until it had settled down in  
a quiet and orderly train, and of  
scrupulously obeying the laws through  
the whole of his career, civil and  
military, of which the hiitory of the  
world furnishes no other ex-ample.

strong, though not so acute as that of a Newton  
Bacon or Locke; and as far as he saw, nojudg

derived from councils of war, where, hearing al  
sup-irestions. he selected whatever was best; and  
certainly no general ever planned his battles  
more judiciously, lint aerangea aunng tne

slow in re-adjustment. The consequence was,  
that he olten failed in the field, and rarely a­  
gainst an enemy in &#x27; station, as at Bos on and

sonal dangers with the calmest unconcern.  
Perhaps the strongest feature in his character  
was prudence, never acting until every circum

During the war and after it we correspon­  
ded occasionally, and in the four years of  
my continuance in the office of Secretary  
of State, our intercourse was daily, confi.  
deutial, and cordial. After I retired from  
that office, great and malignant pains  
were taken by our federal monarchists,  
and not entirely without effect, to make  
him view me as a theorist, holding French  
principles of government, which would  
lead infallibly to licentiousness and anar­  
chy. And to this he listened the more  
easily, from my known disapprobation of  
the British treaty. I never saw him af­

should have been dissipated before his  
  
just judgment, as mists before the sun. I

More time and recollection would en­

country successfully through an arduous  
  
war, for the establishment of its independ  
  
ence; of conducting its councils through  
  
the birth ot a goverorrent, new in its  
  
forms and principles, until it had settled  
down into a quiet and orderly train; aud  
of scrupulously obeying the laws through  
  
the whole of his career, civil and milita  
  
ry, of which the history of the world fur  
nishes no other example.  
  
How, then, can it be perilous for you  
to take such a man on your shoulders?  
  
I am satisfied the great body of republi­  
cans think of him as I do. We were,  
  
indeed, dissatisfied with him on his ratifi  
  
cation of the British treaty. But this was  
short-lived. We knew bis honesty, the  
  
wiles with which he was encompassed  
  
and that age had already begun to relax  
  
the firmness of his purposes ; and I am  
convinced he is more deeply seated in the  
  
love and gratitnde of republicans, than in  
  
Pharasaical homage of the federal mon­  
archists. For he was no monarchist  
  
from preference of his judgment. The  
soundness of that gave him correct views  
  
of the rights of man, ana his severe jus  
  
tice devoted him to them. He has often  
  
declared to me mat ne considered our  
new constitution as an experiment on the  
practicability of republican government.  
  
and with what dose of liberty man could  
be trusted for his own good ; that he was  
  
determined the experiment should have a  
  
fair trial, and would lose the last drop of  
  
his blood in support of it. And these dec  
  
larations he repeated to me the ofiener  
  
and the more pointedly, because he knew  
  
my suspicions of Col. Hamilton&#x27;s views,  
  
and probably had heard from him the  
same declarations which I had, to wit.  
  
that the British constitution, with its un  
  
equal representation, corruption, and oth  
  
er existing abuses, was the most perfect  
government which had ever been estab  
  
lished on earth, and that a reformation of  
  
these abuses would make it an irppractic  
  
able government.&#x27; I do believe that Gen  
  
eral Washington had not a firm confi  
dence in the durability of our govern  
  
ment. He was naturally distrustful of  
  
men, and inclined to gloomy apprehen-  
i .  
  
sions : ana l was ever persuaaea mat a  
belief that we must at length end in  
  
something like a British constitution, had  
  
some weight in his adoption of the cere  
  
monies of levees, birthdays, pompous  
  
meetings with Congress, and other forms  
of the Bame character, calculated to pre­  
pare us gradually for a change which he  
believed possible, and to let it come on  
with as little shock as mign: be to the  
public mind.

“ I think (says the author,) I knew General  
Washington intimately and thoroughly ; and  
were I called on to delineate his character, it  
should be in terms like these—  
“ His mind was great and powerful, without  
being of the first order : his penetration strong,  
though not acute as that of Newton, Bacon, or  
Locke ; and as far as he saw, no judgment was  
ever sounder. It was slow in operation, being  
little aided by invention or imagination, but  
sure in conclusion. Hence the common re­  
mark of his officers, of the advantage he de­  
rived from councils of war, where hearing all  
suggestions, he selected whatever was best;  
and certainly no general planned his battles  
more judiciously. But if deranged during the  
action, if any member of his plan was dislocat­  
ed by sudden circumstances, he was slow in a  
re-adjustment. The consequence was, that he  
often failed in the field, and rarely against an  
enemy in station, as at Boston and York. He  
was incapable of fear, meeting personal danger  
with the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the  
strongest feature in his character was prudence,  
never acting until every circumstance, every  
consideration was maturely weighed, refraining  
if he saw a doubt, but when once decided, go­  
ing through with his purpose, whatever obsta­  
cles opposed. His integrity was most pure, his  
justice the most inflexible I have ever known,  
no motives of interest or consanguinity, of  
friendship or hatred being able to bias his de­  
cision. He was, indeed, in every sense of the  
word, a wise, a good and a great man.  
“His temper was naturally irritable and high  
toned, but reflection and resolution had obtain­  
ed a firm and habitual ascendancy over it. If  
ever, however, it broke its bounds, he was  
most tremendous in hi» wrath. In hig expenses  
he was honorable but exact; liberal in contri­  
butions to whatever promised utility ; but  
frowning and unyielding on all visionary pro­  
jects, and all unworthy calls on his charity.—  
His heart was not warm in his affections ; but  
he exactly calculated every man’s value, and  
gave him a solid esteem proportioned to it.  
“ His person was fine, his stature exactly  
what one would wish, his deportment easy,  
erect and noble ; the best horseman of his age,  
and the most graceful figure that could be seen  
on horseback. Although in the circle of his  
friends where he might be unreserved with  
safety, he took a free share in the conversation;  
his colloquial talents were not above mediocrity,  
possessing neither copiousness of ideas or flu­  
ency of words. In public, when called on for  
a sudden opinion, he was unready, short and  
embarrassed. Yet he wrote readily, rather dif­  
fusely in an easy and correct style. This he  
had acquired by conversation with the world,  
for his education was merely reading, writing,  
and common arithmetic, to which he added sur­  
veying at a later day. His time was employed  
in action chiefly, reading little, and that only in  
agriculture and English history. His corre­  
spondence became necessarily extensive, and  
with journalizing his agricultural proceedings,  
occupied most of his leisure hours within doors.  
On the whole, his character was, in its mass,  
perfect—in nothing bad, in few points indiffer­  
ent, and it may truly be said, that never did na­  
ture and fortune combine more perfectly to  
make a man great, and to place him in the same  
constellation with whatever worthies have me­  
rited from man an everlasting remembrance.  
For his was the singular merit of leading the  
armies of his country successfully through an  
arduous war, for the establishment of its inde­  
pendence—of conducting its councils through  
the birth of a government, new in its forms and  
principles, until it had settled down into a quiet  
and orderly train—and of scrupulously obeying  
the laws through the whole of his career, civil  
and military, of which the history of the world  
furnishes no other example.

His mind was great and powerful,  
without being of the veiy first order ; his  
penetration strong, though not so acute  
as that of Newton, Bacon, or Locke;  
as far as he saw, no judgment was eve­  
sounder. It was slow in operation, be­  
ing little aided bv invention or imagin­  
ation, but sure in conclusion. Hence  
the common remark of his officers, of  
the advantage he derived from councils  
of war, where, hearing all suggestions,  
he selected whatever was best; and cer.  
tainly no general ever planned his bat­  
tles more judiciously. But if deranged i  
during the course of the action, if any  
member of his plan was dislocated bv  
sudden circumstances, he was slow in a  
re-adjustment The consequence was,  
that he often failed in the field, and rare­  
ly against an enemy in the station, as  
at Boston and York. Ho was incapa­  
ble of fear, meeting personal danger  
with the calmest unconcern. Perhaps  
the strongest feature in his character  
was prudence, never acting until every i  
circumstance, every consideration, was  
maturely weighed; refraining if he saw  
a doubt, but when once decided, going  
through with his purpose, whatever ob­  
stacle opposed. His integrity was j  
most pure, his justice the most inflexi­  
ble 1 have ever known ; no motives of ;  
interest or consanguinity, of friendship  
or hatred, being able to bias his dteisioa.  
He was, indeed, in every sense ot the  
word, a wise, a good, and a great man. |  
| His temper was naturally irritable and i  
I high-toned ; but refl&#x27; ction and resolu- 1  
tioa had obtained a firm and habitual i  
ascendancy over it. If ever, however;  
it broke its bounds, he was most tre­  
mendous in Lis wrath. In his exped­  
ts&#x27;-s he was honorable, but exact; liberal  
in contributions to whatever promi c«  
! utility ; but frowning and unyielding on  
i all Missionary projects, and all unwor-l  
j thy calls on his charity. His heart was!  
Oiot warm in its affeciions; but be exact!  
calculated every man&#x27;s value, an if  
gave, him a solid esteem propoi tioneiLfb  
it. Ips person, you know, wayfoe,  
his stature exactly what one would  
wish ; Lis deportment easy erect and no­  
ble, the best horseman of his age. and  
the mod graceful figure that could be  
i seen on horseback.  
Although in the circle of bis friends,  
! « hen he might be unreserved with safety,  
he took a free share in conversation, his  
colloquial talents wore not above medi­  
ocrity, possessing neither copiousness of  
ideas fluency of words. I n public, w hen  
called on for a sudd&lt;_n opinion, he was  
unready, short, and embarrassed. Yet  
j he wrote readily, rather diffusely, in an  
i easy and correct stvle. This he had  
acquired by conversation with the world,  
\ for his education was merely reading,  
writing, and common arithmetic, to  
which he added surveying at a latter  
1 day. His time was empdoyed in action  
| chiefly, reading little, and that only in  
agriculture and English history. His  
j correspondence became necessarily ex­  
tensive, and with journalizing his agri­  
; cultural proceedings, occupied most of  
j his leisure hours within doors. On the  
i whole, his character was, in its mass,  
I perfect, in nothing bad, in a few points  
indifferent; and it may truly be said,  
that never did nature and fortune com­  
bine more completely to make a man  
I great, and to place him in the same i  
i constellation with whatever worthies  
| have merited from man an everlasting |  
rememberance. For this was the sin- ;  
; gular destiny and merit of leading the  
j armies of his country successfully throu’  
■ an arduous war, for the establishment of j  
its independence; of conducting its  
councils through the birth of a govern-  
I ment, new in its forms and principles,  
i until it had settled down into a quiet  
! and orderly train ; and of scrupulously&#x27;!  
obeying the laws through the whole of]  
his career, civil and military, of which  
,&#x27;he history of the world furnishes not  
\ other example—Jeffencn.

ration, we commend it to tho careful attention  
of our readers, as embodying in a short space  
all that need bo said of that great and good  
man. It is written in tho conciso and vigorous  
stylo for which its illustrious author was so re­  
markable, and is worthy of being treasured in  
the memory of every admirer of tho “ Father  
of his Country,” or the immortal writer and  
signer of the Declaration of Independence:  
I think I knew General Washington inti­  
matelyand thoroughly; and were I called on  
to delineato his character, it should be in  
terms like these: * ■  
  
His mind was great and powerful, without  
b«ing of the very first order; liis penetration  
sitrong, though not so acute as that of a New­  
ton, Bacon, or Locke; and, as far as he saw,  
no judgment was ever sounder. It was slow in  
operation, being little aided by invention or  
imagination, but sure in .conclusion.  
Henco tlie common remark of - his officers,  
of tho advantage he derived from councils of  
war, where, hearing all suggestions, he se­  
lected whatovor was best, and cortainly no  
General ever planned his. battles more judi­  
ciously. But if deranged during the course of  
the action, if any member of his plan was dis­  
tracted by sudden circumstances, he was slow  
In a re-adjustmont. The consecpicnco was  
that ho often failed in the field, and rarely  
against an enemy in station, as at Boston and  
York. Ho was incapable of fear, meeting per­  
sonal dangers with the calmest unconcern.  
Perhaps tho strongest featuro in his  
character was prudence, never acting un­  
til every circumstance, every consideration,  
was maturely weighed; refraining if he buw a  
doubt, hut, when once decided, going through  
with his purpose, whatever obstacles opposed.  
His integrity was most pure, his justice the  
most inflexible 1 have ever known; no motives of  
interest or consanguinity, of friendship or ha­  
tred being able to bias his decision. lie was,  
indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a  
good, and a great man.  
His temper was naturally irritable and high­  
toned ; but reflection and resolution had ob­  
tained a firm and habitual ascendancy over  
it. If ever, however, it broke its bounds, ho  
was most tremendous in his wrath.  
In his expenses ho was honorable, but exact;  
liberal in contributions to whatever promised  
utility; but frowning and unyielding on all vi­  
sionary projects, and all unworthy calls on his  
charity. His heart was not warm in its affec­  
tions, but ho exactly calculated every man’s  
value, and gave him a solid esteem propor­  
tioned to it. His person, you know, was fine,  
his stature exactly what one would wish, his  
deportment easy, erect, and nobio; the best  
horseman of his age, and tho most graceful  
figure that could bo scon on horseback. Al­  
though in tho circle of his frionds, where ho  
might be unreserved with safety, ho took a  
lree share In conversation; his colloqutal ta­  
lents were not above mediocrity, possessing  
neither copiousness of Ideas nor fluoncy of  
■words.  
  
In public, when called on for a sudden opi­  
nion, he was unready, short, and embarrassed.  
Yet ho wrote readily, rather diffusely, in an  
easy and correct style. This he had acquired  
by conversation with tho world, for his educa­  
tion was merely reading, writing, and common  
arithmetic, to which&#x27;ho added surveying at a  
later day. His time was employed in action  
chiefly, reading little, and that only in agricul­  
ture and English history. Ills correspondence  
became necessarily extensive, and, with jour­  
nalising his agricultural proceedings, occupied  
most of his leisure hours within doors. On  
the whole, his character was,&#x27; in its mass, per­  
fect—in nothing bad, in fow points indifferent;  
and it may truly bo said, that never did na­  
turo and fortune combine more perfectly to  
make a man groat, and to place him  
in tho same constellation with whatovor  
worthies have merited from man an everlast­

Jefferson’s Portrait of Washington.  
  
Thomas Jefferson, writing to l)r. Walter  
Jones, in a letter dated Monticello, January  
2d, 1814, draws a living portrait of Wash­  
ington. These two great men are both  
honored in the picture. Jefferson says:  
I think I knew General Washington inti­  
mately and thoroughly; and were I called

selected whatever was best; and certainly no  
General ever p&#x27;anned his battles more judi­

quence was, that he often failed in the field,

Declaration of Independence : .  
I think I knew General Washington  
intimately and thoroughly j and were I  
called on to delineate his characcr, it  
should be in terms like these :  
His mind was great and powerful, with­  
out being of the very first order; bis pene­  
tration strong, thoug not so acute as that  
of a Newton, Bacon or Locke; and, as far  
as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder  
It was flow in operation, beiug little aided  
by invention or imagination, but sure in  
conclusion.  
Hence the common remark of his offi­  
cers, of the advaotago be derived from  
councils of war, where, hearing all sn?.  
gestions, ho selected whatever was best,  
and certainly no general ever planned his  
battles niorc judicjonsly.. Bul itderanged  
during the course of tho action, if nny  
member of his plan was distracted by cer­  
tain circumstances, he wns slow in a read  
justment. The consequence was that he  
often failed in the Geld, and rarely against  
an enemy in station, as at Boston or New­  
York. He was incapable of fear, meeting  
personal dangers with the calmest un­  
concern.Perhaps tho strongest feature in his  
character was prudence, never acting until  
every circumstance, evcry consideration,  
was maturely weighed: refraining if he  
saw a doubt, but when once decided, go­  
ing through with his purpose,-whatever  
obstacles opposed. Ills integrity was nios  
pure, his justice tho most inflexible Ihnve  
ever known; no motives of interest oreon­  
sanguinity, of friendship or hatred being  
able to bias his decision. &#x27;He was, indeed;

its bounds, he was tremendous in his  
wrath.  
In hisexpenscs he washonorable,but exact;  
liberal in contributions to whatever promis­

all visionary projects, and all unworthy

every man&#x27;s value, and gave him a solid  
esteem proportioned to it. His person,

what one would wish, lii3 deportment easy,

illustrious author was so remarka­  
ble, and is worthy of being treasur  
ed in the memory of every admirer  
of the &quot;Father of his Country,&quot; or  
the immortal writer and signer of  
the Declaration of Independence:  
&quot;I think I knew General Wash-  
ington intimately and thoroughly,  
and, were I called on to delincate  
his character, it should be in terms  
like this:  
His mind was great and power  
ful, being of the very first order;  
in penetration strong, though not  
so acute as that of Newton Bacon,  
and Locke; and, as far as he saw,  
no judgment was ever sounder. It  
was slow in operation, being little  
aided by invention or imagination,  
but sure in its conclusions,  
Hence the common remark of his  
officers of the advantage he derived  
from councils of war, where, hear­  
ina all suggestions, he selected  
whatever was best, and certainly  
no General ever planned his battles  
more judiciously. But if deranged  
during the course of the action, if  
y member of his plan was distrac  
ted by sudden circumstances, he  
was slow in a readjustment. The  
consequence was, that he often fail­  
ed in the field, and rarely against  
an enemy in station, as at Boston  
and York. He was incapable of  
fear, meeting personal dangers with  
the calmest unconcern.  
Perhaps the strongest feature in  
his character was prudence; never  
acting until every circumstance,  
every consideration, was maturely  
weighed; refraining if he saw a  
doubt, but, when once decided, go  
ing through with his purpose, what  
ever obstacle opposed. His integ  
rity was pure, his justice the most  
inflexible I have ever known; no  
motive of interest or consanguinity,  
of friendship or hatred being able  
to bias his decision. He was, in  
deed, in every sense of the word, a  
wise, a good, and a great man.  
His temper was naturally irritas  
ble and high toned, but reflection  
and resolution had obtained a firm  
and habitual ascendency over it  
If ever, however, it broke its bounds  
he was most tremendous in his  
wrath.  
In his expenses, he was honora  
ble, but exact; liberal in contribu  
tions to whatever promised utility,  
but frowning and unyielding on all  
visionary projects, and all unwor  
thy calls on his charity. His heart  
was not warm in its affections, but  
he exactly calculated every man&#x27;s  
value, and gave him a solid esteem  
proportioned to it. His person, you

In public, when called on for a  
sudden opinion, he was unready

wrote readily, rather diffusely, in  
an easy and correct style. This he  
had acquired by conversation with  
the world, for his oducation was  
morely reading, writing, and com­  
mon arithmetic, to which he added  
surveying at a later day. His time  
was employed in action chiefly,

and came to America with the

though not so accurate as that of  
Newton, Bacon or Locke and as  
tar as he saw, no judgment was

of his officers, of the advantages he

sequence was tiiat lie often failed in  
the field, and rarely against an ene­  
my in station, as at Boston and  
ork. He was incapable of &#x27;ear,  
meeting personal dangers with the  
calmest unconcern. Perhaps the  
strongest feature in his character  
was prudence, never acting until  
every circumstance, every consid­  
eration, was maturely weighed re­  
fraining if he saw a doubt, but when  
once decided, going through with  
his purpose, whatever obstacles op­  
posed.  
  
Ilis integrity was most pure, his  
justice the most inflexible I have  
ever known 110 motives of consan­

on all visionary projects, and all un­  
worthy calls on his charity. His  
heart was not warm in its affections  
but he exactly calculated every  
man&#x27;s value, and gave him a solid  
esteem proportioned to it. His per­  
son, you know, was tine, his stature  
exactly what one would wish his  
deportment easy, erect, and noble,  
the best horseman of his age, and  
the most graceful figure that could  
be seen on horseback. Although in  
the circle of his friends, where he  
might be unreserved with safety, lie  
took a free share in conversation,  
his colloquial talents were not above  
mediocrity, possessing neither copi­  
ousness of ideas, nor fluency of  
words. In public, when called on  
for a sudden opinion, he was un­  
ready, short, and cmbarassed. Yet  
he wrote readily, rather diffusely,  
in an easy and correct style. This  
he had acquired by conversation  
with the world, for his education  
was merely reading, writing, and  
common arithmetic, to which he ad­  
ded surveying at a later day. His  
time was employed in action chiefly,  
reading little, and that only iu agri­  
culture and English history.  
  
His correspondence became nec­  
essarily extensive, and. with jour­  
nalizing his agricultural proceed­  
ings, occupied most of his leisure  
hours in doors. On the whole, his  
character was, in its mass, perfect,  
in nothing bad, in a few points in­  
different: and it may truly be said  
that never did nature and fortune  
combine more perfectly to make a  
man great, and to place him in the  
same constellation with whatever  
worthies have merited from man an  
everlasting remembrance. For his  
was the singular destiny and merit  
of leading the armies of his country  
successfully through an arduous  
war. for the establishment of its in­  
dependence of conducting its coun­  
cils through the birth of a govern­  
ment, new in its form and principles  
until it had settled down into a qui­  
et and ordinary train and of scru­  
pulously obeying the laws through  
the u hole of his career, civil and  
military, of which the history of the  
world furnishes no other example.

great am? powerful,&#x27;  
without being of the very first order ;  
his penetration strong, though not. so  
acute as that of Newton, Bacon, Locke,  
and as far as he saw, r &#x27;! Igment was  
ever sounder. It wae - . l operation  
being little aided by in , . -i or imagin­  
ation, but sound in eoar! usion. Hence  
the common remark of l.U officers, of the  
an vantages be derived from councils of  
war, where, hearing all suggestions, he  
selected whatever was best, and certainly  
no general ever planned his battles more  
judiciously. But if deranged during tho  
course of the action, if any member of his  
plan was dislocated by sudden circum­  
stances, he was slow in a readjadgment.  
The consequence was, that he often failed  
in the field, and rarely against an enemy  
in station, as at Boston and York. He  
was incapable of fear, meeting personal  
dangers with the calrneet unconcern.  
Perhaps the stronger feature in his char­  
acter was prudence, never acting till eve­  
ry circumstance, every consideration was  
maturely weighed; refrained if he saw a  
doubt, but when once t&#x27;ecided, going  
through with his purpose, whatever ob­  
stacles opposed. .  
His integrity was most pure, his jus-  
tice the most inflexible I have ever known,  
no motives of consanguinity, of friend­  
ship, or hatred, being able to bios his de­  
cision. He was, indeed, in every senso  
of the word, a wise, a good and great  
man. His temper was .naturally irrita­  
ble and high toned ; but reflection and  
resolution had obtained a firm and ha­  
bitual ascendeacy over it. If ever, how­  
ever, it broke its bounds, he was most  
tremendous in his wrath. In his expen  
ses he was honorable, but exact ;&#x27; liberal  
in contributions to whatever promised  
utility, but frowning and unyielding on &#x27;  
all visionary projects, and all unworthy  
calls on his charily. His heart was not  
warm in its ailections, but he exactly  
calculated every man&#x27;s value, and gave  
him a solid esteem proportioned to it.  
His person, you know, was fine ; his stat­  
ure exactly what one would wish ; his de­  
portment easy, erect, and noble, the best  
horseman of his age and the most grace­  
ful figure that could be seen on horse­  
back. Although in the circle of his  
friends, where he might be unreserved  
with safety, he took a free share in con­  
versation ; his colloquial talents were not  
above mediocrity, possessing neither cop­  
iousness of ideas or fluency of words. In  
public, when called on for a sudden opin­  
ion, he was unready, short and embarrass­  
ed. Yet he wrote readily, rather diffuse­  
ly, in an easy and correct style. This he  
had acquired by conversation with the  
world, for his education was merely read­  
ing, writing and common arithmetic, to  
which he added surveying at a later day.  
His time was employed in action chiefLT  
reading a little, and that only in agricul­  
ture and English history.  
His correspondence became necessarily  
extensive, and, with journalizing his ag­  
ricultural proceedings, occupied most of  
his leisure hours within doors. On the  
whole, his character was, in its mass, per­  
fect, in nothing bad, in a few points in­  
different ; and it may truly be said, that  
never did nature &#x27;and fortune combine  
more perfectly to make a man great, and  
to place him in the same constellation  
with whatever worthies have merited  
from man an everlasting remembrance.  
For bis was the singular destiny and  
merit of leading the armies of his conn­  
try successfully through an arduous war,  
lor the establishment of its independence ;  
or conducting its councils through the  
birth of a government, new in its form  
and principles, until it had settled down  
into a quiet and orderly train; and of  
scrupulously obeying the laws through  
the whole of his career, civil and military,  
of which the history of tbe world Inrnish­  
es no other example.

It was John Adams who wrote, as late

The allusion was to the period of his  
own administration, when he took the  
Presidency encumbered, as he thought,

JEFFERSON&#x27;S OPINION OF WASHWONHT  
While at Monticello, in the year 1814, Jefferson  
wrote a letter in which he says: &quot;I

his character, it should Ite in. terms  
like these: His mind was great and powerful,  
without being of the very first order; his penetration  
strong, thoogh not so acute as that of  
Newton, Bacon or Locke; and as far as he saw,  
no judgment was ever sounder. It; was slow  
in operation, being little aided by invention  
or imagination, butsure in conclusion. Hence  
the common remark of his officers, of the advantage  
he derived from councils of war,  
where, hearing all suggestions, he selected  
what was best; and certainly no General ever  
planned his battles more judiciously. But if  
deranged during- the course of the action, if  
anv member of his plan was dislocated by  
suaden circumstances he was slow in a re-ad}  
ustment The conseouence was that he often  
failed in the field, and rarely agaiiist an ene- 4#

JgCIO TViMA UiV VWmiVBH Huwuvv&gt;a&gt;r- *. ? ??,  
the strongest feature in his character was prudence;  
never acting until every circumstance,  
every consideration, was maturely weighed, refraining  
if he saw a doubt; but when once decided,  
going through with his purpose, whatever,  
obstacles opposed. His integrity was  
most pure, Lis justice the most inflexible I have  
ever known, no motives of interest or consanguinity,  
of friendship or hatred being able to  
bias his decision. He was, indeed; in every  
sense of the word, a wise, a good and a great  
man. His temper was naturally irritable and  
high-toned ; but reflection and resolution had  
obtained a firm and habitual ascendency over  
it If ever, however, it broke its bonds, he  
was most tremendous in his wrath. In his expenses  
he was honorable, but exact; liberal in  
contributions to whatever promised utility;  
but frowning and- unyielding on all visionary  
projects, and all unworthy calls on his charity.  
His heart was nqt warm in its afibctions; bnt  
he exactly calculated every man&#x27;s value, and  
gave him solid esteem proportioned cc it. His  
person, you know, was jSne, his stature exaotly  
what one would wisby his deportment easy,  
erect and noble; the beet horseman of his age,  
and the most graceful , figure that oould do  
seen on horseback. Aftjftugh in the circle of  
his friends/where he migat be unreserved with  
safety, be took a free share in conversation;  
his colloquial talents were npt above mediocrity,  
possessing neither copiousness of ideas,  
nor fluency of wordk In nublio, when called  
  
on for a sadden opinion, he was unready,  
short and embarrassed. Yet he wrote, readly,  
rather diffusely, in an easy and correct  
style. This he had acquired by conversation,  
with tb&quot; world, for his eduyafion was merely  
reading, writing and common arithmetic, to  
which he added surveying at a later day. His  
time was employed in actum chiefly/ leading  
little and that only inagricillture and English,  
history. His correspoadeg|ft.becam6 necessarily  
extensive, and, with(jf||nal using his agricultnral  
proceedings, occupied most of his  
leisure hours within doors. On the whole,^  
his character was, in its mass, perfect, in noth- v  
ing bad, in few points indifferent/and it may  
truly be said, that never did ttttpra and fortune  
combine more perfectly to make a great  
man, and to plaoe him in thp same constellation  
with whatever worthies have merited from  
ftan, an everlasting remembrance. For hia. .  
was the singular destiny and merit of.leading  
the armies of his country, successfully through  
in arduous war, for the establishment of its  
^dependence, of conducting its councils  
through the birth, of a government, new in its  
forms and principles, until it had settled down  
nto a quiet and orderly train / and of scrupuously

His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very  
first order; his penetration strong, though not so acute as that  
of a Newton, Bacon, or Locke; and as far as he saw, no judg-  
ment was ever sounder. It was slow in operation, being little  
aided by invention or imagination, but sure in conclusion.  
Hence the common remark of his officers, of the advantage he  
derived from councils of war, where, hearing all suggestions, he  
selected whatever was best; and certainly no general ever  
planned his battles more judiciously. But if deranged during  
the course of the action, if any member of his plan was dislo-  
cated by sudden circumstances, he was slow ina re-adjustment.  
The consequence was, that he often failed in the field, and  
rarely against an enemy in station, as at Boston and York. He  
was incapable of fear, meeting personal dangers with the calm-  
estunconcern. Perhaps the strongest feature in his character  
was prudence, never acting until every circumstance, every con-  
sideration was maturely weighed; refraining if he saw a doubt,  
but when once decided, going through with his purpose, what-  
ever obstacles opposed. His integrity was most pure, his jus-  
tice the most inflexible I have ever known; no motives of inter-  
est or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred, being able to bias  
his decision. He was, indeed, in every sense of the word, a  
wise, a good, and a great man. His temper was naturally irrit-  
able and high-toned ; but reflection and resolution had obtained  
a firm and habitual ascendency over it. If ever, however, it  
broke its bounds, he was most tremendous in his wrath. In his  
expenses he was honorable, but exact; liberal in contributions  
to whatever promised utility ; but frowning and unyielding on  
all visionary projects, and all unworthy calls on his charity.  
His heart was not warm in its affections ; but he exactly calcu-  
lated every man’s value, and gave him a solid esteem propor-  
toned to it. His person, you know, was fine, his stature exactly  
what one would wish ; his deportment easy, erect, and noble,  
the best horseman of his age, and the most graceful figure that  
  
  
  
could be seen on horseback. Although in the circle of his  
friends, where he might be unreserved with safety, he took a  
free share in conversation, his colloquial talents were not above  
mediocrity, possessing neither copiousness of ideas nor fluency  
of words. In public, when called on for a sudden opinion, he  
was unready, short, and embarrassed. - Yet ‘he wrote readily,  
rather diffusely, in an easy and correct style. This he had ac-  
quired by conversation with the world, for his education was  
merely reading, writing, and common arithmetic, to which he  
added surveying at a later day. His time was employed in  
action chiefly, reading little, and that only in agriculture and  
English history. His correspondence became necessarily ex-  
tensive, and with journalizing his agricultural proceedings, oc-  
cupied most of his leisure hours within doors. On the whole,  
his character was, in its mass, perfect, in nothing bad, in a few  
points indifferent ; and it may truly be said, that never did na-  
ture and fortune combine more completely to make a man  
great, and to place him in the same constellation with whatever  
worthies have merited from man an everlasting remembrance.  
For his was the singular destiny and merit of leading the armies  
of his country successfully through an arduous war, for the es-  
tablishment of its independence; of conducting its councils  
through the birth of a government, new in its forms and princi-  
ples, until it had settled down into a quiet and orderly train;  
and of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his  
career, civil and military, of which the history of the world fur-  
nishes no other example.

ferent. The conditions of public use  
and of personal greatness were different.  
But if we are to talk of ideals, heroes,  
and models, I, for one, should hardly  
look to France at all. Jefferson was no  
flatterer of George Washington ; but his  
character of Washington comes far near¬  
er to the right pattern of a great ruler  
than can be found in any of Carlyle’s  
splendid dithyrambs, and it is no waste  
of time to recall and to transcribe it:—  
  
Hit mind was great and powerful, without  
being of the rery first order ; his penetration  
strong, though not to acute as that of a New

, I genuine history of the course of his mind  
&#x27; j through the trying scenes In which It wasen-  
! caged nnd of tho soduetlont) by which It was  
I deoolved. but not depraved. I think I knew  
; Geo. Washington Intimately and thoroughly.  
BB and were I called on to delineate his charao-  
TaTaTas ter It should bo in terms like these:  
  
H Ills mind was groat and powerful without  
BB wing of the very first order; his penetration  
BB stronp; though not bo acute as that of rvNew-  
BB - Uaoon, or Locke, and, ob far as be saw, no  
H judgmont was oer soundor. It was slow in  
BB operation, bolng little Hided by Invention or  
BB Imagination, but euro In conclusion. Hence  
BB the common romnrk of his ofHcorn. of tho nd-  
H vantngs ho derived from councils of war.  
BH where, hearing nil suggestions, ho selected  
BB whatever was best: and certainly no General  
i ever planned his battles more judiciously. But  
H If deranged during the course of the action, if  
BB any membor of bis plan was dislocated by eud-  
B - den circumstances, he was slow In a readjust-  
ment.  
BB The consequence was that ho often failed In  
H the field and rarely against nn enemy in stn-  
H ( tlon, as at Boston nnd York. He waslncaDable  
H I of fear, meeting personal dangors with tho  
H calmest unconcern. I&#x27;erhaps the strongest  
H. &#x27; feature in his character was prudence, never  
BB acting until every circumstnnce, every consid-  
S ration was maturely weighod: refraining if  
e saw a doubt, but. when onco decided, going  
HfB , through with bis purpose, whatever obstaoles  
B opposed.  
BB&#x27; His integrity was most pure, his justice tho  
most InQexlblo I have ever known; no motives  
H of lntorest or consanguinity, of friendship or  
H hatred, being able to bias his decision. He was,  
BB indeed, in ovory sense of the words, a wise, a  
good, and a great man. His temper was nat-  
rally Irritable and high toned, but reflection  
j I - and resolution had obtained a firm and hnblt-  
j &#x27; ual ascendancy over it. If over, however, it  
Hj broke Its bondH he wns most tremendous in his  
I wrath. In, his expenses lie was honorable, but  
f&#x27; &#x27; exact; liberal in contributions to whatever  
I promised utility, but frowning and nnvleldlng  
FH &#x27;on all vlsinnnryprojects and all unworthycalls  
j on bis cbnrlty.  
H His heart was not warm in Its affections, but  
I he exactly calculated every man&#x27;s value, and  
Save him a solid ostcom proportioned to It.  
lis person, you know, was fine, his stature ex-  
B actly what one would wish, his deportment  
H easy, eroet, and noble: the best horseman of  
I&quot; (i bis ago, and the most graceful figure that  
FM &#x27; could be seen on horseback. Although In the  
circle of his friends, where he might bo unro-  
I .served with snfoty, he took a free share In con-  
hV versatlcn. his colloquial tsilontB were not above  
FH&#x27;, rnediocrity. possessing neither copiousness of  
BB1&#x27;1 ideas nor fluency of words. In public, when  
I . called on for a. Hidden opinion, bo was un-  
f , ready, short, nnd omi-arrnssed. let he wrote  
1 readllv. rather diffusely, in nn easy and correct  
H fitilo. This he had acquired by conversation  
H &#x27;with the world, for his oducntlon was merely  
FH reading, writing, nnd common arithmetic, to  
FH &#x27; which he addrd surveying at a later day. His  
Hf time was employed in action chiefly, rending  
FH little, and thatonly in ogitculturo and English  
I history. Ills corro&amp;pnndenco became neces-  
FSj earl I r extensive, nnd, with journalizing his  
B. agriculturnl proceedings, occupiod mot of his  
V &#x27; leisure hours within doors. On the whole his  
eharaoter was, in its mass, perfect: In nothing  
&#x27; ; .bad. In few points indifferent, nnd it may truly  
, be said that never did naturoand fortune com-  
bine morq perfectly to make a man groat, nnd  
to place him in the same constellation with  
. whatever worthies have merited from man an  
BBf&#x27; everiastlng remembrance.  
For his was the singular destiny and merit  
SB. of leading tho armies of his country success-  
j, folly through nn arduous war for the estab-  
I lisbmentof Its Independence; of conductlngits  
councils through the birth of n government,  
BBS, hew in Itsformhand principles, until it had set-  
BBBBJ .tied down Into n quiet and orderly train, nnd of  
BBBBj scrupulously obeying tho lawn through the  
BBBB whole ot his career, civil and military, ofwhloh  
H the history of the world furnishes no other ex-  
B ample.  
B, Hew. then, can It be perilous for you to take  
L; suoh a man nn your shoulders? Iamsntlslied  
H !, the great body of. republicans think of him as  
BB1&#x27; ld&#x27;. &quot;0 wore. Indeed, diexatlstled wlthblm  
BBlf &#x27; &#x27; P.n,ll,s ratillcaiinn of the British treaty: but  
-; this was short llvoj. We know his honesty.  
BBBBr k the wilos with which be was enuom passed, and  
S that ago hud already begun to relax the firm-  
l, peBs of tils purposo: and I am convinced he  
BBBBJ&#x27; Is more dooply sontod In the lovo and gratl-  
t i tudeof thb renubllcnns than In the PhurlmiicaJ  
BBBB nomaxo of the ledernl monarchists, For he  
BBBB was no monarchist from preference of his  
BBBBJ&#x27; Judgment. Tho soundness of that gnve him  
BB correct views of the rights of men. nnd his  
BBBB severe justico dovoted him to them. Ho has  
B&#x27; olten declared to mo that ho considered our  
B tew Constitution as au experiment on tho  
BBBB. practicability of republican government, and  
BBBB with what dose of liberty man could bo trusted  
B for bis own good: that he was determined the  
BBBB axporlment snonld hnve a fair trial, nnd would  
BBBB, lose the lost drop of his blood In support of It.  
BBBB And thoso declarations hn repeated to roe tho  
BBBB. i oftener and more pointedly because he k-jew  
H roysunplcions or Col. Hamilton&#x27;s views, and  
frouably had heard from him the same declnrft-  
Ions which I had. to wit: &quot;That the British  
BBBB Constitution, with Itaunonual representation,  
BBBB corruption, nnd othnr existing nbuses, was the  
1 1 mostiierloctUovernmcntwhich Imdeverboen  
BBBB established on eartli, and that ti reformation of  
BBBBJ thee abuses would make it an impracticable  
Goyemruont.&quot;  
ildo believe that Gen. Washington hnd not n  
Arm confldenco in the durability of our Govern­  
ment. He wns naturally dlstruntiiil of men,  
and inclined to gloomy apprehensions; and I  
Wn ever persuaded that a belief that we must  
at length end In something like a British Con­  
stitution, had some weight In his adoption of  
the ceremonies of levee, birthdays, iximpotia  
meetings with Congress, und other forms of the  
ame ounractor. calculated to prepare us grad­  
ually for a ohnngo whloh ha believed possible,  
and to lot Itcomo on with as little shock us

TTietenre my opinions of Qen, Washington,  
which I would vouch nt the judgment sent of  
God. having been formed on an acquaintance  
i of thirty rears. I fen-ed with him In the Vir­  
ginia Ieglslature from &quot;O&#x27;t to the Itsrnlutlon­  
aryvrar. and again it short time In Congress,  
until ho lelt us to take command of tho army.  
During 111&quot; war. und niter It, wo corresponded  
occasionally, and In the four ynnrxof my con­

felt, on bis death, with my countrymen, that  
&quot;Vorlljr a groat man hath fallen tills day in

I think I know Cieneral Washington inti­  
mately and thoroughly, and were I called ou 10  
.lelineate hi* character it should be in terms  
.ike these :  
His mind was great ami powerful without be­  
iug of the very first order; his penetration  
f-trong, though i/ot w&gt; acule as that of a Newton,  
Bac-m or Locke, and. as far as he saw. no judg­  
ment wa« ever soauder. It was slow in opera­  
tion, being little aided by inveution or imagin*­  
lion, but sure in conclusion Heuee the rom­  
mou remark ef his officers, of the advantage he  
denveri from councils of war, where, hearing  
all supgesiious, he selected whatever was best;  
Hud certaialy no General ever planned his  
lialtles mere judiciously. But if deranged dur­  
ing the course ol the action, if any member ot  
his plan was dislocated by sudden circum­  
suuees, he was tlow in a readjustment.  
The consequence was that ne often failed in  
the Held «nd rarely against an enemy in na­  
tion, as ai Boston ana York, lie was incapable  
of fear, meeting personal dangers witu the  
  
calmest unconcern. Perhaps the .-troncest  
feature in his character was prudence, uever  
acting until every circumstance, every consid­  
eration was maturely weighed: refraining if he  
Raw ii doubt, but, when once decided, going  
through with his purpose, whatever obstacles  
opposed.  
His integrity was most pure, hi* justice the  
most inflexible I have eve known: no motives  
of interest or consanguinity, of friendship or  
hatred, being able to bias his decision. He wa^,  
indeed, in eveiy sense of the words, a wise, a  
good and a great man. His temper was nat­  
urally irritable and hieh toued, bat reflection  
and resolution had obtained a firm and habit­  
ual ascendancy over it. If ever, however, it  
broke its bonds he wan most tremendous in his  
wrath. In his expenses he was honorable, but  
exact; hberai in contributions to whatever  
promised utility, but ftowuiug and unyielding  
on all visionary projecU and all unworthy ca Is  
on his charity.  
His heart was not warm in its affections, but  
he exactly calculated every man&#x27;s value, and  
«aye him a solid esteem proportioned to It His  
person, you know, was fine, his stature exaetlv  
what one would wish, his deportment ea*s&quot;,  
erect and noble; the best horseman nl his age  
and the most (,&#x27;rcceful figure that could lie seen  
on hoieebaek. Although in the circle of his  
friends, where he might be unreserved with  
.-eft&#x27;ty, he took a free share in conversation his  
colloquial talents were not above mediocrity,  
possessiug neither copiousness of ideas nor ilii­  
eucy of words. In pubUV, when called on for a  
sudden opinion, he was unready, short and cm­  
ba rassed. Vet he wrote leadily rather dif­  
fusely, in an easy and correct style. This he  
had acqiiind by conversation with the world,  
for vi» education was merely reading, writing  
and a common arithmetic, to which he udded  
surveying at a later day. His time was em­  
ployed in aitiou chiefly, reading little, and that  
only in agriculture and English history. His  
correspondence became necefsarilv extensive,  
and, with journalizing his agricultural proceed­  
ings, occupied most of his leisure hours within  
doors. Ou the whole his character was. in its  
mass, peilect; in nothing bad. in few points in­  
diflerent, and it may truly be said that never  
did nature and fortune combine more perfectly  
ti&gt; make a man great, and to place him in the  
same constellation with whatever worthies  
have merited from man an everlasting remem­  
brance.

mon arithmetic, to which he added sur­

His mind was great and powerful without

and of scrupulously obeying tho laws through  
tho whole of hh career, civil and military, of  
which the history of the world furnishes no  
other example.  
These ore my opinions of General Washing­  
ton, which I would vouch at tho judgment scat  
of God, having been formed on an acquaint­  
ance of thirty years. I served with him in the  
Virginia legislature from lTfffltotho Revolu­  
tionary war, and again a short time in con­  
gress, until he left us to toko command of the  
army. During tho war, and after it, w o cor­  
responded occasionally, and in tho four j cars  
of my continuance in tno office of secretary of  
stato our intercourse was daily confidential  
and cordial.  
After I retired from that office great and  
malignant pains wero taken by our federal  
monarchists, and not entirely without effect,  
to make him view mo as a. theorist holding  
French principles of government, w hich would  
lead infallibly to licentiousness and anarchy.  
And to this ho listened the more easily from  
my known disapprobation of the British  
treaty. 1 never saw him afterward, or these  
malignant insinuations should havo been dis­  
bipatcd before his just judgment as mists be­  
fore tho 6un. I felt, on his death, with my  
countrymen, that &quot;Verily a great man hath

style. This he had acquired by  
conversation with the world, for |  
his education wA merely reading,  
writing and common arithmetic, to j  
which ho added surveying at a lator j  
day.  
His time was employed in action  
chiefly, reading little, and that only  
in agriculture and English history.  
His correspondence became neces­  
sarily extensive, and, with journal­  
ising his agricultural proceedings,  
occupied most of his leisure hours  
within doors. On the whole his  
character was, in its mass, perfect;  
in nothing bad, io few points indif- j  
ferent, and it may truly be said  
that never did nature and fortune  
combine more perfectly to make a  
man great and to place him in the j  
same constellation with whatever  
worthies have merited from man an  
everlasting remembrance.  
For his was the singular destiny  
and merit of leading the armies of  
bis country successfully through an  
arduous war for tho establishment  
of its independence; of conducting  
its councils through the birth of a  
government, new in its forms and  
principles, until it bad settled down  
into a quiet and orderly train, and  
of scrupulously obeying tbe laws  
through the whole of bis career,  
|civil and military, of wbicb the bis­  
  
? tory of the world furnishes no other  
examplo.  
These aro my opinions of General  
Washington, wliich I would vouch  
at the judgmertl seat of God, hav­  
ing been formed ?.n an acquaintance  
of thirty years. I served with him  
in the \ irginia Legislature from  
I7G9 to the Revolutionary war, and  
again a short time in Congress,  
until ho left us to take command of  
the army. During the war, and  
after it, we corresponded occasion­  
ally, and in the four years of my  
continuance in the office of Secre­  
tary of State our intercourse was  
daily cofidential and cordial.  
After I retired from that office  
great and malignant pains wore  
taken by our federal monarchists,  
and not entirely without effect, to  
mako isim view mo as-a &quot;theorist  
holding French principles of gov-&#x27;  
ernment, which would leud infal- I  
libly to licentiousness and anarchy. I  
And to this ho listened the more |  
easily from my known disapproba­  
tion of tho British treaty. I nover  
saw him afterward, or theso mali­  
gnant insinuations should have been I  
dissipated before hisjust judgment as j  
mists before tho sun. I felt, on his |  
death, with my countrymen, that j  
&quot;Verily a groat man bath fallen this !  
day in Israel.&quot;

he is placed in  
his proper light. He stands at the head  
of a new country, a new age and a new  
world. His personality and his life mark  
the dividing line. Old things were to pass  
away and new things were to take their  
place.  
He is the beginning of the most wonder-  
ful era of the world. The marvels of hu  
man progress since his day have sur.­  
the wonders of imagination, and  
the country of his love under the govern-  
ment of his care, has been the instru-  
ment of the most wonderful advances.  
In drawing this oration to a close, let  
me give the summary of his virtues as  
drawn by Thomas Jefferson: &quot;P.  
the strongest feature in his character  
was prudence, never acting until every  
circumstance, every consideration was  
maturely weighed; refraining if he saw a  
doubt, but, when once decided, going  
through with his purpose, whatever ob-  
stacles opposed. His integrity was most  
pure, his justice the most inflexible I  
have ever known, no motives of interest  
or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred,  
being able to bias his decision. He was.  
indeed, in every sense of the word, a  
wise, a good and great man.

&quot;Washington&#x27;s mind was great and  
powerful without being of the very first  
orders. His penetration was strong  
though not so acute as that of a New­  
ton , Bacon or Locke. As far as ho saw  
no judgment was over sounder. It was  
slow in operation being little aided by  
invention or imagination , but sure in  
conclusion. Hence , the common re­  
mark of his officers of the advantage ho  
derived from councils of war where ,  
hearing all suggestions , he selected  
whatever was best , and , certainly no  
general ever planned his battles more  
judiciously. But , if deranged in the  
course of the action , if any member of  
lu&#x27;s plans was dislocated by sudden cir­  
cumstances , he was slow in readjust  
ment. The consequence was that he  
often failed in the field but rarely  
against an enemy in station , as at Bos­  
ton and York. Perhaps the strongest  
point in his character was prudence ,  
never acting until every circumstance ,  
every consideration , was maturely  
weighed ; refraining if he saw doubt ,  
but when once decided , going through  
with his purpose whatever obstacles op  
posed. His integrity was most pure  
His justice the most inflexible I have  
ever known , no motive of interest or  
consanguinity , of friendship or hatred ,  
being able to bias his decision. He was ,  
indeed , in every sense of the word , a  
wise , a good , and a great man. His  
temper was naturally high-toned , but  
reflection and resolution had obtained a  
firm aud habitual ascendency over it.  
If over , however , it broke its bonds , he  
was tremendous in his wrath. In his  
expenses he was honorable but exact  
liberal in contributions to whatever  
promised utility ; but frowning and un­  
yielding on all visionary projects and on  
all unworthy calls of charity. His heart  
was not warm in his affections but he  
exactly calculated every man&#x27;s value  
and gave him a solid esteem proportioned  
tioned to it. His person was fine , his  
stature exactly what one would wish ;  
his deportment easy , erect , noble. The  
best horseman of his age , and the most  
graceful figure that could be seen on  
horseback. Although in the circle of  
his friends , where he might bo unre­  
served with safety , he took a free share  
conversation , his colloquial talents were  
not above mediocrity. In public , when  
called on for a sudden opinion , he was  
unready , short , embarrassed. Yet , he  
wrote readily , rather diffusely , in an  
easy and correct style. This he had ac­  
quired by conversation with the world  
for his education was only reading ,  
writing and common arithmetic , to  
which ho added surveying &quot;later. His  
time was employed in action chiefly ,  
, reading little , and that only in agricul­  
ture and English history. His corres­  
pondence necessarily became extensive  
and , with journalizing &quot;his &quot;agricultural  
  
proceedings , occupied most of MR. Jerauro  
lours within doors. On the \vhole- ,his  
character wa1 * , iu its mass , perfect;in  
nothing bad ; in a few points indifferent ;  
it may be truly said , that never did Na­  
ture and fortune combine more perfectly  
to make a great man , and place him in  
the same constellation with whatever  
worthies have merited from man&#x27;s &#x27;over-  
lasting remembrance. * * * I do  
believe that General Washington had  
not a firm confidence in the durability  
of our government. He was naturally  
distrustful of men and inclined to  
gloomy apprehensions , and I was ever  
persuaded had a belief that we must at  
length end iu something like the British  
constitution.
