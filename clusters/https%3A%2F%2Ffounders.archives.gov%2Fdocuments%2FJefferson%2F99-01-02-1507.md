ear Sir.   
  
Fort Mandan, April 7th. 1805.  
  
Herewith inclosed you will receive an invoice of certain articles, which I have forwarded to you from this place. among other articles, you will observe by reference to the invoice, 67. specimens of earths, salts and minerals; and 60 specimens of plants: these are accompanyed by their rispective labels expressing the days on which obtained, places where found, and also their virtues and properties when known. by means of these labels, reference may be made to the Chart of the Missouri forwarded to the Secretary at War, on which, the encampment of each day has been carefully marked; thus the places at which these specimens have been obtained may be easily pointed out, or again found, should any of them prove valuable to the community on further investegation. these have been forwarded with a view of their being presented to the Philosophical society of Philadelphia, in order that they may under their direction be examined or analyzed. after examining these specimens yourself, I would thank you to have a copy of their labels made out, and retained untill my return. the other articles are intended particularly for yourself, to be retained, or disposed off as you may think proper.—  
You will also receive herewith inclosed a part of Capt. Clark’s private journal, the other part you will find inclosed in a seperate tin box. this journal is in it’s original state, and of course incorrect, but it will serve to give you the daily detales of our progress, and transactions. Capt. Clark dose not wish this journal exposed in it’s present state, but has no objection, that one or more copies of it be made by some confidential person under your direction, correcting it’s gramatical errors &amp;c. indeed it is the wish of both of us, that two of those copies should bee made, if convenient, and retained untill our return; in this state there is no objection to your submitting them to the perusal of the heads of the departments, or such others as you may think proper. a copy of this journal will assist me in compiling my own for publication after my return. I shall dispatch a canoe with three, perhaps four persons, from the extreem navigable point of the Missouri, or the portage betwen this river, and the Columbia river, as either may first happen; by the return of this canoe, I shal send you my journal, and some one or two of the best of those kept by my men. I have sent a journal kept by one of the Sergeants to Capt Stoddard, my agent at St. Louis, in order as much as possible to multiply the chances of saving something. we have encouraged our men to keep journals, and seven of them do so, to whom in this respect we give every assistance in our power.—  
I have transmitted to the Secretary at War, every information relative to the geography of the country which we possess, together with a view of the Indian nations, containing information relative to them, on those points with which, I conceived it important that the government should be informed. If it could be done with propriety and convenience, I should feel myself much obliged by your having a copy taken of my dispatches to the Secretary at War, on those subjects, retaining them for me untill my return. By reference to the Musterrolls forwarded to the War Department, you will see the state of the party; in addition to which, we have two Interpreters, one negroe man, servant to Capt. Clark, one Indian woman, wife to one of the interpreters, and a Mandan man, whom we take with a view to restore peace between the Snake Indians, and those in this neighbourhood amounting in total with ourselves to 33 persons. by means of the Interpreters and Indians, we shall be enabled to converse with all the Indians that we shall probably meet with on the Missouri.—  
I have forwarded to the Secretary at War, my public Accounts rendered up to the present day. they have been much longer delayed than I had any idea that they would have been, when we departed from the Illinois, but this delay, under the circumstances which I was compelled to act, has been unavoidable. The provision perogue and her crew, could not have been dismissed in time to have returned to St. Louis last fall without evidently in my opinion, hazarding the fate of the enterprise in which I am engaged, and I therefore did not hesitate to prefer the sensure that I may have incurred by the detention of these papers, to that of risking in any degree the success of the expedition. to me, the detention of those papers have formed a serious source of disquiet and anxiety; and the recollection of your particular charge to me on this subject, has made it still more poignant. I am fully aware of the inconvenience which must have arrisen to the War Department, from the want of these vouchers previous to the last session of Congress, but how to divert it was out of my power to devise.—  
From this place we shall send the barge and crew early tomorrow morning with orders to proceed as expeditiously as possible to St. Louis, by her we send our dispatches, which I trust will get safe to hand. Her crew consists of ten ablebodied men well armed and provided with a sufficient stock of provisions to last them to St. Louis. I have but little doubt but they will be fired on by the Siouxs; but they have pledged themselves to us that they will not yeald while there is a man of them living.  
Our baggage is all embarked on board six small canoes and two perogues; we shall set out at the same moment that we dispatch the barge. one or perhaps both of these perogues we shall leave at the falls of the Missouri, from whence we intend continuing our voyage in the canoes and a perogue of skins, the frame of which was prepared at Harper’s ferry. this perogue is now in a situation which will enable us to prepare it in the course of a few hours. as our vessels are now small and the current of the river much more moderate, we calculate on traveling at the rate of 20 or 25 miles per day as far as the falls of the Missouri. beyond this point, or the first range of rocky Mountains situated about 100 miles further, any calculations with rispect to our daily progress, can be little more than bare conjecture. the circumstance of the Snake Indians possessing large quantities of horses, is much in our favour, as by means of horses, the transportation of our baggage will be rendered easy and expeditious over land, from the Missouri, to the Columbia river. should this river not prove navigable where we first meet with it, our present intention is, to continue our march by land down the river untill it becomes so, or to the Pacific Ocean. The map, which has been forwarded to the Secretary at War, will give you the idea we entertain of the connection of these rivers, which has been formed from the corresponding testemony of a number of Indians who have visited that country, and who have been seperately and carefully examined on that subject, and we therefore think it entitled to some degree of confidence. Since our arrival at this place we have subsisted principally on meat, with which our guns have supplyed us amply, and have thus been enabled to reserve the parched meal, portable soup, and a considerable proportion of pork and flour, which we had intended for the more difficult parts of our voyages. if Indian information can be credited, the vast quantity of game with which the country abounds through which we are to pass leaves us but little to apprehend from the want of food.—  
We do not calculate on completeing our voyage within the present year, but expect to reach the Pacific Ocean, and return, as far as the head of the Missouri, or perhaps to this place before winter. You may therefore expect me to meet you at Montochello in September 1806.—  
On our return we shal probably pass down the yellow stone river, which from Indian informations, waters one of the fairest portions of this continent.  
I can foresee no material or probable obstruction to our progress, and entertain therefore the most sanguine hopes of complete success. As to myself individually I never enjoyed a more perfect state of good health, than I have since we commenced our voyage. my inestimable friend and companion Capt. Clark has also enjoyed good health generally. At this moment every individual of the party are in good health, and excellent sperits; zealously attached to the enterprise, and anxious to proceed; not a whisper of discontent or murmur is to be heard among them; but all in unison, act with the most perfect harmony. with such men I have every thing to hope, and but little to fear.  
Be so good as to present my most affectionate regard to all my friends, and be assured of the sincere and unalterable attachment of  
Your most Obt. Servt.

adions.  
I fhall oifpatch a canoe with three, perhaps four &#x27;  
perfous, from the extreme navigable point on the Mif- |  
four! or the portage between this river and the Co- i  
lumbia river, as either may firft happeti ; by thu re­  
turn of this canoe I fhall fend you my journal and  
fome one or two of the bed kept by my men. I have !  
f&lt;-nt a journal kept by one of the fergeants to Captain j  
Stodderr at Fort Lewis, in order as much as partible !  
to multiply the chance* of laving fontething, we have &#x27;  
encouraged our men to keep journals, and feven of  
them do fo ; to whom in this ti-fpcd we give every  
afliflance in our power.  
I have tranfmitted to the Secretary at War every  
information relative to the Geography of the country  
wc poflefs, together with a view af the Indian nations, J  
containing information relative to them, on thole  
points with which ! conceived ic important the go­  
vernment fltould he informed.  
By reference to the mufler roll* forwarded to the  
War Department, you will fee the flute of the party ;  
in addition to which we have two interpreters, one |  
negro man fervant to Captain Clarke and one Indian j  
women, wife to one of the interpreters, and a Maudau  
man, whom we take with a view to reflore peace be­  
tween the Snake Indian* and timfe in this neighbour­  
hood, amounting in total with ourfclves to 513 perlons;  
hr mean* of the interpreters and Indians we lhall he  
enabled probably to converfe with all the Indians we  
lhali meet ott the MilTum,. I have for v. aided to the  
Secretary at War,my public accounts rendered up to  
the prefent day ; they have been much longei de­  
layed than I had any idea that they would have been  
when we departed from the Illinois ; bur this delay  
under thecircumftances which I was compelled to adt,  
has been unavoidable. The provifion perogue and  
her crew could not have been difmifted in time to have  
returned to St I.otiis, Lift full, without evidently in :  
my opinion hazarding the fate of the interprife in I  
which I am engaged, and I therefore did not hiTn.ue I  
to prefer the cenfure that 1 may have incurred, by the  
detention of thefe papers, to that of rifquing in any  
degree the luccefs of the expedition. The detention  
of thele papers has been a fource cf furious difquiet &amp;  
anxiety to me, and therecolledlicn of your particular  
charge upon that fubje&lt;£!, has made it ftill more poig­  
nant. I am fully aware of the inronvrniencts which  
muft have a.rifeii to the War Department from the  
want of thefe vouchers, previous to the laft leflion of  
Congrcfs; hut how to avert it was out of my power  
to devife. From this place we lhall fend the Barge  
and crew early to-morrow morning, with orders to  
proceed as expeditioufly as poflihle to St. Louis, by  
her we lend our difna&#x27;ches, which 1 truft will gel fufe  
tohar.d ; h r crew confift- of ten able bodied n.en,  
well armed, and provided with a fufiirimt flock of pro­  
vifions to iafl them to St. Louis; I have but little  
doubt they will be fired on by the Siouxas, but they  
have pledged thcmfelves to uvhat they will not yield,  
while there is a man of th-m living. Our baggage is  
all embarked on boards fmallcanoes, &amp;.twoprr,,gucs;  
we fhall fet out at the fame moment that we dil&#x27;patch  
the barge, ore or perhaps both of thefe perognt-s we  
Ihad leave a? the fall* of file MilTonri ; from whence  
we intend continuing our voyage in the canoes and a  
perogue of (kins, the frame of which was prepared at  
I .arper s Ferry. This perogue is now in a fltuation  
that will enable us to prepare it in the coutfe of a few  
hours; as our veiTcis arc row fmall, and the current  
of the river more moderate, we calculate on travelling  
20 or 23 miles j r day, as far asrhe falls of the Md­  
fmiri ; beyond this point, or the tirli range of rockv  
mountains, fituated about 1O0 miles farther, any calcu­  
lation with refpeift fo our daily progrefs,can he ibtk*  
more than bare cnnj&quot;&lt;9iire. Thecinumftance of the  
Snake Indians pofTefTing large flocks of horles, is much  
in our favor, as bv means cf horfes the tranfportation  
of our baggage will he rendered eafy and expeditious  
over land from the MilTonri to the Columbia river  
Should this river not prove navigable w here we firft  
meet Wit,, it, out ptc-feiit intention i* to continue our  
march doom the river, until it becomes fo, or to the  
Pacific Ocean. The map which has been forwarded  
to the Secretary at War, will give you the idea we  
entertain of the conned) ion between thefe rvers, which  
has been formed from the correfponding feftimony of  
a number of Indian*, who have vifited that country,  
and who have been feparately and carefully examined  
nti that fubjei1}, we therefore think it intitled to fome  
degree of confidence. Since our arrival at this place,  
wc have fuhfifted principally on meat; with which  
our guns hare fupplied us amply, and have thy been  
enabled to referve the parched meal, portable loop and  
a corftderahl? proport,on nf o ,rk and flour, which we  
had inten &#x27;ed for the more difliru t parts of our voya&lt;re.  
It Indian information can he credits J, the vaft quan­  
tities of game with which the coumry abounds,  
through which we are to pafs, leaves us lint little to  
apprehend from the want of food. We do nntcaku­  
1 ite on completing our voyage wnliin the prefent year,  
1 v: expo.51 to roach the Pacific Ocean and return as’  
fir as the head of the M 1&#x27;oun, or perhaps to this  
place before winter. You may therefor* expedl me to  
meet you at Monticello. in September 180(5. On our  
return wc Hull probably p-ofs down Yellow Stone ri­  
w.-r, which from Indian information, waters one of  
the fain-fl portions of our continent, f can forefee no  
material or probable obd-uiflion to our progrefs, and  
entertain therefore the mod fatignine hopes of com- !  
plete fuccrft. As to myfrtf,individually, I never *n- j  
joyed better health, th in I have finre we commenced 1  
our voyage. My pie ft in able friend and companion i  
Captain C lurk, lu, a..t) enjoyed itood health gem ral­

Fort Manbax, April 7th, 1805.  
Dear Sir,  
Herewith inclosed yott will receive an invoice of  
certain articles, which I have forwarded to you from  
this place ; among other articles you will observe by  
reference to the invoice, 67 specimens of earths,  
salts, minerals, and 60 specimens of plants ; these  
are accompanied by their respective labels, expres­  
sing the days on which they were obtained, the pla­  
ces where found, and also their virtues, and proper­  
ties when known ; by means of these labels, refer­  
ence may be made to the chart of the Missouri, for­  
warded to the Secretary of War; on which the en­  
campment of each day has been carefully marked ;  
thus the places at which these specimens have been  
• obtained may be easily pointed out and again found,  
should any of them prove valuable to the community  
on further investigation.  
You will herewith also receive a part of captain  
Clark’s private journal, the other part you will find  
inclosed in a separate tin box. This journal will  
serve to give you the daily details of our progress,  
and transactions.  
  
I snail nespatcn a canoe witn three, perhaps tour  
persons, from the extreme navigable print on the  
Missouri or the portage between this 1 iver and the  
Columbia river, as either may first happen ; by the  
return of this canoe I shall send you my journal and  
some one or two of the best kept by my men. I have  
sent a journal kept by one of the sergeants to captain  
Stoddert at Fort Lewis, in order as much as possible  
to multiply the chances of saving something, we have  
encouraged our men to keep journals, and seven of  
them do so, to whom in this respect we give every  
assistance in our power.  
I have transmitted to the Secretary at War every  
information relative to the Geography of the country  
vc possess, together with a view of the Indian na­  
tions, containing information relative to them, on  
those points with which I conceived it important the  
government should be informed.  
By reference to the muster rolls forwarded to the  
War Department, you will see the state of the party;  
in addition to which we have two interpreters, one  
negro man servant to captain Clarke, and one Indi­  
an woman, wife to one of the interpreters, and a  
Mandun man, whom we take with a view to restore  
peace between the Snake Indians and those in this  
neighbourhood, amounting in total with ourselves to  
S3 persons ; by means of the interpreters and Indi­  
ans we shall be en .bled probably to converse with all  
the Indians we shall meet on the Missouri. I have  
forwarded to the Secretary of War, my publick ac­  
counts rendered up to the present day ; they have  
been much longer delayed than I had any idea that  
they would have bem when we departed from the Il­  
linois ; but this delay under the circumstances which  
I was compelled to act, has been unavoidable. The  
provision perogue and her crew could not have been  
dismissed in time to have returned to St. Louis, last  
full, without evidently in my opinion hazarding the  
fate of the enteprize in w hich I am engaged, and I  
therefore did not hesitate to prefer the censure that  
I may have incurred, by the detention of these pa­  
pers, to that of risquing in any degree the success of  
the expedition. The detention of these papers has  
been a source of serious disquiet and anxiety to me,  
and the recollection of your particular charge upon  
that subject, h is made it still more poignant. I am  
fuHy aware of the inconveniences which must have  
ari .en to the war department from the want of these  
vouchers, previous to the last session of Congress ;  
but how to avert it was out of my power to devise.—  
From this place we send the barge and crew early to­  
morrow morning, with orders to proceed as expedi­  
tiously as possible to St. Louis, by her we send our  
despatches, which I trust will get safe to hand ; her  
crew consistsof ten able bodied men, well armed, and  
prowded with a sufficient stock of provisions to last  
them to St. Louis ; I have but little doubt they will  
be fired on by the Siouxs, but they have pledged  
themselves to us that they will not yield while there  
is a man of them living.  
  
Uur onggage is an emnariteu on board six small  
canoes, and two perogues ; we shall set out at the  
same moment that we despatch the barge, one or  
perhaps both of these perogues we shall leave at the  
falls of the Missouri; from whence we intend con­  
tinuing our voyage in the canoes and a perogue of  
skins, the frame of which was prepared at Harper’s  
Ferry. This perogue is now in a situation that will  
enable us to prepare it in the course of a few hours ;  
as our vessels are now small, and the current of the  
river more moderate, we calculate on travelling 20  
or 23 miles per day, as fir as the falls of the Mis­  
souri ; beyond this point, or the first range of rocky  
mountains, situated about 100 miles farther, any cal­  
culation with respect to our daily progress, can be  
little more than bare conjecture. The circumstance  
of the Snake Ju lians possessing large stocks of  
horses, is much in our favour, as by means of horses  
the transportation of our baggage will be rendered  
easy and expeditious over land from the Missouri to  
the Columbia river. Should this river not prove na­  
vigable where we first meet with it, our present in­  
tention is to continue our march down the river, until  
it becomes so or to the Pacifii k Ocean. The map  
which has been forwarded to the Secretary at War,  
will give you the idea we entertain of the connexion  
between these rivers, which has been formed from j  
the corresponding testimony of a number of Indians,  
who have visited that country, and who have been  
separately and carefully examined on that subject, we  
therefore think it entitled to some degree of confi-i  
dence. Since our arrival at.this place, we have sub- j  
sisted principally on meat; with which our guns j  
have supplied us amply, and have thus been enabled  
to reserve the parched meal, portable soup, and a  
considerable proportion of pork and flour, which we  
had intended for the more difficult parts of our  
. voyage. If Indian information can be credited, the  
vast quantities of game with which the country a­  
bounds, through which we are to pass, leave us but  
little to apprehend from the want of food. We do  
not calculate on completing our voyage within the  
present year, but expect to reach the Pacifick Ocean -  
and return as far as the head of the Missouri, or  
perhaps to this place before winter.—You may there­  
fore expect me to meet you at Monticello, in Septem­  
ber 1806. On our return we shall probably pass down  
Yellow Stone river, which from Indian intormation,  
waters one of the fairest portions of our continent.  
_I can foresee no material or probable obstruction  
to our progress, and entertain therefore the most  
sangmne hopes of complete success. As to myself,  
individually, I never enjoyed better health, than I  
have since we commenced our voyage. My inesti­  
mable friend and companion Captain Clark, has also  
enjoyed good health generally; at this moment every  
individual oftlie party is in good health and excellent  
spirits, zealously attached to the enterprise, and  
pnxlout to proceed; not a whisper of discontent, or  
jnurmur is to be heard among them, but all in unison  
act with tlie mpst perfect harmony. With such men  
||utve e very thing fe hope and but little to few

! on l*,at subjeX, we therefore think it in*  
J titled to some degree of confidence.  
‘ Since our arrival at this place, we have  
j subsisted principally on meat; with which  
our guns have sdpplied us amply, and  
i have thus been enabled to reserve the  
! parched meal, portable aoup 8c a consider­  
j aWe proportion of poifc and flour, Which  
j we had intended for the more difRcuUpan*  
J. of our voyage. If Indian information can &#x27;  
j be credited, the vast quantities of game I  
with which the country abounds, through •  
! which we are to pass, leaves as but little j  
i to apprehend from the want of food. We  
do not calculate on completing our voyage  
within the present year, but expeX to  
reach the Pacific Oceanf and return as far &#x27;  
! as the head of the Missouri, or perhaps  
j to this place before winter. You may  
I therefore cxpeX me to meet you at Mon­  
ticello, in September 1806. On our re- j  
turn we shall probably pass down Yellow  
Stone riven’, which from Indian informati­  
on, waters one of the fairest portions of our  
continent. 1 can furesee no material or  
probable obstruXion to our nroerress. *ml I  
  
entertain therefore the most sanguine  
hopes of complete success. As to myself,  
individually, I never enjoyed better health,  
than I have since we commenced our voy­  
age. My inestimable friend and compa­  
nion Captain Clark, has also enjoyed good  
health generally ; at this moment -every  
individual of the party is in good health  
and excellent spirits zealously attached to  
the enterprise and anxious to proceed ;  
not a whisper of discontent, or mur­  
mur is to be heard among them, but all  
J m unison a61 with the most perfetl har­  
mony. With such men I have every  
thing to hope and but little to fear.

Fort Mandan, April 7, 1805.  
Dear Sir,  
Herewith inclosed you will receive an  
invoice of earnin&#x27;articles, which 1 have  
forwarded to you trom this place ; a*  
moug other articles you will observe by  
reference to the invoke 67, specimens  
bfeartha, salts, minerals, and 60 speci­  
mens of plants ; these are fcccarapsnied  
Vr their respective labels, expressing  
tne days oo which they wera obtained,  
ttiw places where found, and also, their  
virtues, and properties when known; by  
Mans of these labels, reference maybe  
made to the chart of the Missouri, for.  
warded to the secretary of war; on  
which the encampment of each day has  
been carefully marked; thus the places  
at which these specimens have been ob­  
tained may be easily pointed out end a.  
gain found should any- of thei* prove va­  
luable K&gt; the community On further in.  
You will herewith also receive a part  
of Cnpt. Clarke’s private journal, the  
other part you will find inclosed in a se­  
parate tin bo*. This journal will serve  
to give you the daily details of our pro­  
grass, and transactions. ,  
I shall dispatch a canoe with three,  
perhaps four persons, from the extreme  
navigable point on the Missouri or the,  
portage between this river and the Co­  
lumbia river, a* either may first happen;  
by the return of this esnoo I shall send  
you my journal and some one or two of  
the best kept by my men. • 1 have kit  
•journal kept by one of the seijcants tp  
  
Cspt. StodJert at Port Lewi*, in order  
as much at possible to multiply the chan­  
ces of saving something, we have en­  
couraged our men to keep journals, and  
scVen Of them do s6, to- whom ‘in this  
respect we give every assistance i* our  
power#  
I have transmitted to-the Secretary at  
war every information relative to the ge­  
ography of the country We possess j to­  
gether with a view of the Indian nations,  
containing information relative to them,  
on those points which I conceive it im­  
portant the government should be infor­  
med.  
&#x27; : By reference to the muster rolls for­  
warded to the war department, you w ill  
see the state of the party ; in addition  
to which we have two interpreters, one  
negro man servant to Captain Clarke,  
and Indian woman wife to one of the  
interpreters, end e Mandan man, whom  
we take with a view to restore peace be­  
tween the Snake Indiana and those in  
this neighbourhood, amounting in total*  
with ourselves to S3 persons « by the  
means of the interpreters and Indians,  
we shall be enabled probably to converse  
with all the Indians ve shall meet on the  
Missouri. 1 have forwarded to the se­  
cretary at war, my public accounts ren­  
dered up to the present day ; they have  
been much longer delayed than I had  
any idee dial they yrould have been when  
1 departed from the Illinois; but this  
delay under the circumstances which I  
Was compelled to ad, has been unavoid­  
abla. The provision perogue and her  
crew could not haw keen dismissed in  
time to have returned to St. Lewis, last  
fall, without evidently in _ my opinion  
hazarding the fat# of the enterprizc in  
which I am engayd, and I therefore did  
not hesitate to prfer the censure that 4  
may have incurred, by the detention ef  
these papers, tothat of risqaing in any  
degree the tucqess of the expedition.—  
  
The detention pt these papers nss oeen  
■ source of serous disquiet and anxiety  
to fine, and th« recollection ofyour par­  
ticular charge bn that subject, ftas made  
it still more pqgnant. I am fully aware  
of the inconvtniencies that must have  
arisen to the war department from the  
want of these touchers, previous to the  
last session of Congress ; but how to  
avert it was out of my power to devise.  
From this place we shall send the barge  
and crew early to-morrow morning,  
with orders to proceed as expeditiously  
as possible to St* Lewis, by her wehend  
our dispatches, which I trust wif get  
safe to hand; her crew consists  
able bodied men, well armed, and  
Vided with a sufficient stock of pi  
onstoiast them to St. Lewis: I  
butTtttle doubt they will be fired  
{he Siouxs, but they have pledged  
selves to us that they will not  
while there is a man of them livin|  
Our baggage is all embarked on  
six small canoes, and two perogoes  
shall set out at the tame moment  
dispatch the barge, one or perhaps  
of these perogues we shall leave at  
fallsof the Missouri ; from whtscf ve  
intend continuing our voyage in the ca­  
noes arid a perogue qf skins, the frame  
of which was prepared at Harper’s Fer­  
ry. This perogue is now in a situation  
that will enable us to prepare it js the  
course of a few hours ; as our vessels  
are now small, and the current ofthe ri­  
ver more moderate, we calculate on  
travelling SOor.tS miles per day, as far  
as the falls of the Missouri ; beyond this  
point, or the first range of rocky moun­  
tains, situated about 100 miles farther,  
any calculation with respect to our daily  
progress, can be little more than bare  
conjecture. The circumstance of the  
Me  
Snake Indians possessing Urge stocks of  
horses, is much in our favour; as by.  
means of horses the transportation of our  
baggage will he rendered easy and expe­  
ditious over land from the M iwotri to  
the Columbian river. Should this river  
not prove navigable where we first meet  
with it, our present intention is to con­  
tinue our march down the river, until it  
becomes so, pr to the Pacific Ocean.  
The map which has been forwarded  
to the secretary at war, will give you  
the idea we entertain of the connection  
between these rivers, which has been  
formed from the corresponding testimo­  
ny of a number of Indians, wh have vi­  
sited that country, and who have been  
separately and carfully examined on that  
subject, we therefore think it intitied to  
some degree of confidence. Since our  
arrival at this place, we have subsisted  
principally on meat, wi|h which our guns  
i have supplied us amply, apd have thus  
been enabled to preserve the parched  
meal, portable soup and a considerable  
proportion of pork and flour, which we  
had intended for the more difficult part  
! of our voyage. If Indian information  
! can be credited^ the vast quantities of  
  
game with which the country abound*,  
through which we are to pa**, have* us  
but little to apprehend from the want of  
food. We do not calculate on comple­  
ting our,voyage within the present year,  
but expect to reach the Pacific Ocean and  
return » far ax the head of the Missouri,  
or perhaps to this place before winter.—  
You may therefore expect me to meet  
you at Monticello, in-September 1806.  
On our return we shall probably pass  
down Yijlow Stone river, which from  
Indian information, waters one of the.  
fairest portions of our continent. 1 can  
foresee no material or. probable obstruc­  
tion to our progress, and entertain there­  
fore the most sanguine hopes of complete  
success. &quot;As to myself, individually 1  
never enjoyed better health, than I haVe  
since we commenced our voyage. * My  
inestimable friend and companion Capt.  
Clarke, has also enjoyed good health  
generally ; at this moment every indi­  
vidual of the party is in good health and  
excellent spirits, zealously attached to  
the enterprise and anxious to proceed ;  
&quot;hot a whisper of discontent, or murmur  
is to be heard among them, but all in  
unison act with the most perfect harmo­  
ny. With such men I have every thing  
to hope and but liule to fear.

Dear Sy,  
Herewith inctofed you will receive  
- an invoice of certain articles, which I  
have forwarded to you from this  
place ; among othier articles you will  
observe by Yeﬁrc‘ncc to the invoice, 67  
specimens of earth, f{alts, minerals, and  
6o specimens of plants ; these are ac.  
companied by their relpective labels,  
cxprefling the days on which they  
&#x27; were obtained, the places were found,  
, &amp;and also, their virtues and properties  
‘when known ; by means of these la­  
bels, reference may be made to the  
-gchart of the Miftbari, forwarded to  
the Secretary of War 3 on which the  
‘encampment of each day has been  
carefully miarked ; thus the places at  
which these fpecimens’have been ob­  
tained may be easily pointed out  
and again found should any of them  
prove valuable to the community on  
further investigation. i  
- You will hetewith also receive a part  
of Captain Clark’s private journal, the  
other part you will find inclofed in a  
feperate tin box. This journal will  
serve 1o give you the daily details of  
our progress and tranfa&amp;ions.  
I shall dispatch a canoe with three,  
perhaps four persons, from the extreme  
navigable point on the Miflouri or the  
portage between this and the Colum­  
bia river, as either may firft happen ;  
on the return of this canos I thall fend  
you my journal and some one or two  
of the best kept by my men. I have  
sent a journal kept by one of the ser­  
geants to Capt. Stoddert at Fort Lew­  
-Is, in order as much as poflible to  
maltiply the chances of saving some­  
thing, we have encouraged our men  
to keep journals, and seven of them do  
so ; to whom in this refpe®t we give  
every afliltance in our power. ;  
I have transmitted to the Secretary  
at War every information relative to  
the Geography of the country we  
pollels, together with a view of the In­  
dian nations, containing information  
relative to them, on those points with  
which I tonceived it important the  
government should be informed. \
By reference to the muster rolls for­  
warded tothe War Department, you  
will fee the state of the party ; in ad­  
dition to which we have two interpre­  
ters one negro man, servant to Capt.  
Clarke, and-one Indian woman, wife  
to one of the interpreters, and a Man.  
dan man, whom we take with a view  
.to -reftore’ peace between the Snake  
-Indians and thof¢ in this neighbor­

selves to 33 persons ; by means of the  
Anterpreters and indians we (hall be en­

wascompelledto a&amp;t,has been unavoid­  
able. The provision perogue and her  
@rew could not have been dismissed in  
time to have returned to St. Louis,  
{aft fall, without evidently in my o­  
pinion hazarding the fate of the enter­  
prise in which I am engaged, and [  
therefore did not hesitate to prefer the  
. censure that I may have incurred, by  
the detention of these papers, to that  
-of rifquing in any degree the {uccefs  
‘of the expedition.-~The detention of  
thes: papers has been a fouree of seri­  
ous disquiet and anxiety to me, and’  
the recolletion of your particular  
~charge upon that fubjeét, has madeiit  
still more poignant. .I am fully aware  
of the inconveniences which must have  
arisen to the War Department from.  
the want of these vouchers, previous:  
to the last fefion of Cougreﬁ; but  
Bow to avert it was out of my power  
to devise. From &#x27;this place we shall  
fend the barge and crew early to-mor­  
row morning, with orders to proceed  
as expeditiously as possible to St. Lou­  
is, by her we fend our dispatches,  
which I trust willdgez fafe to hand ;  
her crew consists of ten able bodied  
-meny well armed, and provided with  
2 fufficient stock of provilions to lalt  
‘them to St. Louis ; I have but little  
~ doubt they will be fired 8n by the Si­  
ouxs,but they have pledged them(elves  
to us that they will potyield while  
&quot; thiere is a man of them living. Our  
- baggage is all embarked on board fix  
small canoes, and two, perogues ;we  
‘fhall set out at the famé moment that  
_we dispatch the batge, one or perhaps  
botly of these perogues we shall leave:  
“at the falls of the Miffuuri ; from  
whence we intend continuing our voy­  
age in the canoes and a. T of  
&quot; fkios, the frame of which was pre­  
pared at Harpers Terry. This pe­  
gogue js now in @ fitation that will  
pabis us £ prepare i b SEE o B  
8 few hours ;as our velicls are now  
“small, and the cuirent of the river  
tare moderat, we calculie o trav-  
S faoF eMt » beyond  
s poiat, o the firk range of rocky  
  
motatains situated about 148 miles  
farther, any calculation with refpe&amp;  
to our daily progress, can be little  
more than bare conje@ure. . The cir­  
cumstance of the Snake Indians pof­  
fefling large stocks of hotfes, is much  
in our favor, as by means of, horses,  
the transportation of our baggage wilt  
be rendered easy and expeditiousover  
land from the Missouri to the Colum­  
bia river. Should this river not prove  
navigable where we firt meet with it,  
‘our present intention is to continue our  
march down the river, until it becomes  
{o, or to the Pacific Ocean. The map  
which has been forwarded to the Sec­  
retary at War, will give the idea we  
entertain of the conneétion between  
‘thefe rivers, which has been formed  
from the corresponding tetimony of  
a namber of Indians, who have vifit­  
‘ed&#x27;that ¢ountry;, and who have been  
separately and carefully examined en  
that fabje&amp;, Wwe therefore think it in­  
titled to some degree of corfidence.  
Since our arrival at thic place, we  
have subsisted principally on Meat;  
with which ear guns have supplied us  
amply, and have thus been able to re­  
serve the parched meal, portable soup,  
and a ‘confiderable portion of pork  
and flour, which we had intended for  
the more difficult parts of dur voyage.  
If Indian information can be credited,  
the valt guantities of game with which  
the country abounds, through which  
we are to pass, leaves us but little to  
apprzhiend from the want of food.  
We donot calculate on completidy  
our voyage within the present year,  
but expect to reach the Pacific Ocean  
and return as far as the head of the  
Missouri, or perhaps to this place be-.  
foré winter.—~You may therefore ex­  
pect me to&#x27;meet you at Monticello, in  
September 1806. On our return we  
shall probably pass down Yellow Stone  
river, which from Indianinformation,  
waters one of the fairct portions of  
our continent. I can fore{ee no ma­  
terial or probable obftruion to our  
progress, and entertain the molt san­  
guine hopes of complete success. As  
to myfelf, individually, I never enjoy­  
ed better health, than I have since we  
commencend our voyage. My inefi­  
mable friend and companion, Capt.  
Clark, has also enjoyed good health  
generally 5 at this moment every in­  
dividval of the partyisin good health  
and excellent spirits, zealously attach­  
ed to the enterprise, and anxious to  
proceed ; not a whisper of discontent,  
or murmir is to be heard among them  
but all in unison a&amp; with the most per­  
fet harmony. Withfuch men I have  
every thing to hope and but little to  
fear. &#x27; WU RR eB

offible to multiply the chances of faving  
omething, we have encouraged our men  
to keep journals, and feven of them do fo ;  
to whom in this refpeét we give every af-  
fiftance in our power.  
  
L have tranfmitted to the Secretary at  
War every information relative to the Ge.  
agraphy of the Country we poffefs, to-  
gether with a view of the Indian nations,  
containing information relative to them,  
on thofe points with which I conceived it  
important the government fhould be in-  
tormed.  
  
By reference to the mo fter-rolls forwar-  
ded the War Department, you will fee  
the flate of the party: in addition to  
which we have two interpreters, one negro  
man-fervant to Capt Clark, and one #n-  
dian women, wife to one of the interpre-  
ters, anda Mandan man, whom we take  
with a view to reftore peace between the  
Snake Indians and thole in this neighbour-  
hood, amounting in total with ourielves to  
33 perfons: by means of the interpreters  
and Indians we fhal! be enabled probably  
to converfe with all the Indians we {hall  
meet on the Miffouri. I have forwarded  
to the Secretary at War, my public ac-  
counts rendered up to the prefent day ;  
they have been much longer delayed than  
I had any idea that they would have been  
when we departed from Illinois ; but this  
delay under the circumftances which I was  
compelled to aét, has been unavoidable. The  
provifion peroguve and ber crew could not  
have been difmified in time to have returned  
to St. Louis, lait tall, without evidently in  
my opinion hazarding the fate of the en-  
terprize in which I am engaged, and I  
theretore did not hefitate to preter the cen-  
fure that I may have incurred, by the de-  
tention of thefe papers, tw that of rifquing  
in any degree the fuccefs of the expedition.  
The detention ot thefe papers has been a  
fource of feriou’s difquiet and anxiety to  
me, and the recollettion of your partic-  
ular charge upon that fubjeét, has made it  
fiill more poignant. I am tully aware of  
the inconveniencies which mult have arif-  
en to the War Department trom the want  
of thefe vouchers, previous to the laft feflion  
of Congrefs ; but how to avert it was out of  
my power to devile.From this place we fhall  
fend the Barge and crew early to-morrow.  
morning with orders to proceed as ex pedi-  
tioully as poflible to St. Louis, by her we  
fend our difpatches, which I truft will get  
fate to hand; her crew confifts of ten a-  
ble. bodied men, well armed, and provided  
with a fufhicient flock of provifions to laft  
them to St. Louis; I have but liule doubt  
they will be fired on by the Siouxs, but  
they have pledged themfelves to us that  
they will not yield, while there is a man  
of them living. Our baggage is all em-  
barked on board fix {mall canoes, and two  
perogues ; we fhall fet out at the fame mo-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
‘ment that we difpat  
  
je€iure,  
  
  
  
  
  
ch the Barge, one or  
perhaps both of thefe perogues we fhall  
leave at the falls of the Miflouri; from  
whence we intend continuing our voyage  
in the canoes and a gerogue of fkins, the  
frame of which was prepared at swe ror  
Ferry. This perogue isnow ina fitua-  
tion that will enable us to prepare it in the  
courfe of afew hours ; asour veifels are  
now {mall, and and the current of the riv-  
er more moderate, we calculate on travel-  
ing 20 or 23 miles per day, as far as the  
talls ot the M:ffouri : beyond this point, or  
the firft range of rocky mountains, fitva-  
ted about one hundred miles farther, any  
calculation with refpett to our daily  
progrefs, can be little more than bare con-  
The circumftance of the Snake  
Indians poffefling large flocks of horles, 1s  
much in our favor, as by means of horfes  
the tranfportation of our baggage will be  
rendered eafy and expeditious over land  
from theMiffouri to the Columbia river.  
Should this river not prove navigable  
when we firft meet with it, our prefent in-  
tention is to continue our march down the  
river, until it becomes fo, or to the Pacit-  
ic Ocean. The map which has been for-  
warded to the Secretary at War, will give  
you the idea we entertain of the conneétion  
between thefle rivers, which has been for-  
med from the correfpoading teftimony ofa  
number of the Indians, who have vifited  
that country, and who have been feparately  
and carefully examined on that fubjeét we  
therefore think it entitled to fome degree ol  
confidence,—Since our arrival atthis place  
we have fubfiited principally on meat ; with  
which our guns have fupplied us amply,  
and have thus been enabled to referve the  
parched meal, portable foup and a confid-  
erable proportion of pork and flour, which  
we have intended for the more difficult  
parts of our voyage. It Indian intorme-  
tion can be credited, the vafi quantities of  
game with which the country abounds,  
through which we are to pafs, leaves us  
little ty apprehend trom the want of food.  
We do not calcuiate on completing our  
voyaye within the prefent year, but expeét  
te reach the Pacific Ocean and return as  
tar as the head of the Miflouri, cr perhaps  
to this place betore winter. You may  
therefore expe&amp;t me to meet you at Mon.  
ticello, 1m September, 1806. On our re-  
turn we thall probably pais down Yellow  
Stone river, which trom Indian intorma-  
tion, waters one of the faireft portions of  
our continent. I can forfee no material  
or probable obfiruction to our rrogrefs,  
and entertain, theretore, the moft fanguiue  
hopes of complete fuccefs. As to myfelt  
individually, I never enjoyed better health,  
than I have fince we commenced our voy-  
age. My ineftimable friend and compan.  
ion Captain Clark, has alfo enjoyed good  
health generally ;. atthis moment every  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
individual of the party is in health  
and excellent fpirius, zealoufly attached  
  
| tothe enterprize, and anxious to proceed ;  
not a rT ot difcontent, or murmur is  
| to be heard among them, but all in unifon  
  
at with the moft perfe€tharmory. With  
fuch men I have every thing to hope, and  
but little to fear.

of the Missouri, from whence we intend continuing our  
vovage in the canoes, and a peroque of skins, the frame of  
which was prepared at Harper’s ferry. This peroque is now  
in a situation which will enable us to prepare it in the course  
of a few hours. As our vessels are now small, and the  
current of the river much more moderate, we calculate upon  
travelling at the rate of 20 or 25 miles per day, as far as the  
falls of the Missouri. Beyond this point, or the first range

ber of Indians who have visited that country, and who have  
been separately and carefully examined on that subject, and  
we therefore think it entitled to some degree of confidence.  
Since our arrival at this place we have subsisted principally  
on meat, with which our guns have supplied us amply, and  
have thus been enabled to reserve the parched meal, portable  
soup, and a considerable proportion of pork and flour, which  
we had intended for the more difficult parts of our voyage.  
If Indian information can be credited, the vast quantity of  
game with which the country abounds through which we are  
to pass, leaves us but little to apprehend from the want of  
food.  
  
“ We donot calculate on completing our voyage within the  
present year, but expect to reach the Pacific ocean, and re~  
turn as far as the head of the Missouri, or perhaps to this  
place, before winter. You may therefore expect me to meet  
you at Montecello in September, 1806. On our return we  
shall probably pass down the Yellow Stone river, which, from  
Indian information, waters one of the fairest portions of this

Message from the President, &amp;ec. 169  
  
“ T can see no material or probable obstruction to our pro-  
gress, and entertain, therefore, the most sanguine hopes of  
complete success. As to mvself, individually, I never en-  
joved a more perfect state of good health than I have since  
we commenced our voyage. My inestimable friend and  
companion, Captain Clarke, has also enjoyed good health  
generally. At this moment every individual of the party is  
in good health and excellent spirits, zealously attached to the  
enterprise, and anxious to proceed; not a whisper of dis-  
content or murmur is to be heard among them; but all in  
unison act with the most perfect harmony. With such men

between the Snake Indians, and those ia this neighborhood, amounting in to-  
tal with ourselves to 33 persons. By means of the interpreters and Indians,  
we shall be enabled to converse with all the Indians that we shall probably  
meet with on the Missouri.  
  
I have forwarded to the secretary at war my public accounts, rendered up  
to the present day. They have been much jouger delayed than I had any  
idea they would have been, when we departed from the Illinois; but this de-  
lay, under the circumstances which 1 was compelled to act, has been unavoid-  
able. The provision peroque and her crew, could not have been dismissed in  
time to have returned to St. Louis last fall, without evidently, in my opinion,  
hazarding the fate of the enterprize in which I am engaged ; and I therefore  
did not hesitate to prefer the censure that I may have incurred by the deten-  
tion of these papers, to that of risking in any degree the success of the expe-  
dition. To me the detention of these papers has formed a serious source of  
disquiet and anxiety ; and the recollection of your particular charge to me on  
this subject, has made it still more poignant. Iam fully aware of the incon-  
venience whieh must have arisen to the war department, from the want of  
these vouchers, previous to the last session of congress, but how to avert it  
was out of my power to devise.  
  
From this place we shall send the barge and crew early to-morrow morning,  
with orders to proceed as expeditiously as possible to St. Louis ; by her we  
send our dispatches, which I trust will get safe to hand, Her crew consists  
of ten able bodied men, well armed and provided with a sufficient stock of  
provision to last them to St. Louis. I have but little doubt but they will be  
fired on by the Siouxs ; but they have pledged themselves to us that they will  
not vield while there is a man ot them living. Our baggage is all embarked on  
board six small canoes, and two peroques ; we shall set out at the same mo-  
ment that we dispatch the barge. One, or perhaps both of these peroques, we  
shall leave at the falls of the Missouri, from whence we intend continuing our  
voyage in the canoes, and a peroque of skins, the frame of which was prepar-  
ed at Harper’s ferry. This peroque is now in a situation which will enable us  
to prepare it in the course of a few hours. As our vessels are now smail, and  
the current of the river much more moderate, we calculate upon travelling at  
the rate of 20-or 25 miles per day, as far as the falls of the Missouri. Beyond  
this point, or the first ramge of rocky mountains, situated about 100 miles  
further, any calculation with respect to our daily progress, can be little more  
than bare conjecture. The circumstance of the Snake Indians possessing  
large quantities of horses, is much in our favour, as by means of horses the  
transportation of our baggage will be rendered easy and expeditious over land,  
from the Missouri to the Columbia river. Should this river not prove naviga-  
ble where we first meet with it, our present intention is, to continue our march  
by land down the fiver, until it becomes so, or to the Pacific ocean. The  
map, which has been forwarded to the secretary of war, will give you the idea  
we entertain of the connection of these rivers, which has been formed from  
the corresponding testimony of a number of Indians, who have visited that  
country, and who have been separately and carefully examined on that subject,  
and we therefore think it entitled to some degree of confidence. Since our  
arrival at this place, we have subsisted principally on meat, with which our  
guns have supplied us amply, and have thus been enabled to reserve the  
parched meal, portable soup, and a considerable proportion of pork and flour,  
which we hae intended for the more difficult parts of our voyage. If Indian  
information can be credited, the vast quantity of game with which the country  
abounds through which we are to pass, leaves us but little to apprehend from  
the want of food.  
  
We do not calculate on completing our voyage within the present year,  
but expect to reach the Pacific ocean, and return as far as the head of the  
Missouri, or perhaps to this place, before winter. You may therefore expect  
me to meet you at Monticello in September, 1806. On our return we shail  
probably pass down the Yellow Stone river, which, from Indian information,  
Waters one of the fairest portions of this continent.

serjeants to Captain Stoddard, my agent at St. Louis, in order, as  
much as possible, to multiply the chances of saving something. We

woman, wife to one of the interpreters, and a Mandan man, whom  
we take with a view to restore peace between the Snake Indians, and  
those in this neighbourhood ; amounting, in total with ourselves, to  
thirty-three persons. By means of the interpreters and Indians, we
