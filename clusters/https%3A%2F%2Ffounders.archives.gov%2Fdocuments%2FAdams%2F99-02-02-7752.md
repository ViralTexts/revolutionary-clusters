Dear Sir  
Quincy January 24th. 1823  
  
I thank you for your kind letter of December 13th. And above all for the gift of a precious volume. It is a chain of diamonds set in links of Gold I have never read, nor heard read, a volume of Sermons better calculated and adapted to the age and country in which it was written. How different from the Sermons I heard, and read, in the Town and County of Worcester; from the years, one thousand seven hundred fifty five, to one thousand seven hundred fifty eight  
As my destiny in Life has been somewhat uncommon I must beg your pardon for indulging, in a little egotism, I may say I was born and bred in the center of Theological and Ecclesiastical Controversys a Sermon of Mr Bryant Minister of this Parish who lived on a spot, now a part of the farm, on which I live occasioned the controversy between him and Mr. Niles, Mr. Porter, Mr. Bass, and many others, which broke out like the Eruption of a volcano and blazed with portentous aspect for many years. The death of Dr. Miller the Episcopalian Minister of this town produced a Controversy between Dr. Mayhew and Mr. Apthorp who were both so connected with this town, that they might almost be considered as inhabitants of it. I may almost say that my eyes opened upon Books of Controversy—when I removed to Worcester in f one thousand seven hundred fifty five, I found that County hot with Controversy between the parties of Mr. Buckminster &amp; Mr. Miller—I became acquainted with Dyer, and Doolittle, and Baldwin three notable disputants. Mr Maccarty though a Calvinist was not a bigot but the Town was a scene of disputes all the time I lived there. when I left there I entered into a scene of another disputations at the Bar and not long afterward disputations of another kind in politicks. In later times, I have lived with Atheists Deists, and scepticks, with Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops Monks Priests and Fryars, of the Roman Catholic persuasion, with Arch Bishops, bishops, deans and priests of the Church of England, with Farmer, Price Priestly, Kippis, Rees, Lindsey, Disney and Jebb with the English and Scotch cleargy in Holland and especially with Dr. Macklane at the Hague. I have conversed freely with most of the sects in America and have not been wholly inattentive to the writings and reasonings of all these denominations of Philosophers and Christians. You may well suppose then, that I have had Controversies enough but after all I declare to you, that your twenty nine sermons have expressed the result of all my reading experience and reflections, in a Manner more satisfactory to me than I could have done in the best days of my strength—  
I am Sir with great Respect and / Esteem your obliged friend / and Humble Servant  
John Adams  
P.S. The most afflictive circumstance that I have witnessed in the lot of humanity, are the narrow views the unsocial humour, the fastidious scorn and repulsive tempers of all denominations, excepting one. I cannot conclude this letter without adding an anecdote; One of the zealous mendicants for contributions to the funds of the Missionary societies called upon a Gentleman in Haverhill and requested his charity. The Gentleman declined subcribing, but added there are, in and about the town of Newbury port nine cleargymen Ministers of nine Congregations not one of whom lives, upon terms of civility with any other, Will admit non other into his Pulpit nor be permitted to go into the pulpit of any other—Now if you will raise a fund to send Missionaries to Newbury port to Convert these Nine Clergymen to Christianity, I will contribute as much as any Man—

“ Quincy, Jan. 21, 1023.  
*&#x27; Dear Sir—l thahk you for your kind let­  
ter of the 30th of December, and above all,  
for the gift of a precious volume. It is a chaiu  
of diamonds set in links of gold. I have nev­  
er read nor heard read a volume of sermons  
better calculated or adapted to the age and  
country iu which it was written. How ditFer­  
ent from the sermons I heard and read in the  
town of Worcester, from the years 1755 to  
1758. As my destiny in life has been some­  
what uncommon, I mu‘t beg your pardon for  
indulging in a little egotism, j may say I was  
born and bred in the centre of Theological  
and Ecclesiastical controversy. A sermon of  
Mr. Bryant, Minister of the pari-h, who lived  
on the spot now a part of the farm on which  
I live, occasioned the controversy between  
him and Mr. Niles, Mr. Porter, Mr. Bass, and  
many others; it broke out like the eruption of  
a volcano, and blazed with portentous aspect  
for many years. The death of Dr. Miller, the  
Episcopal Minister of this town, produced the  
controversy between Dr. Mayhew and Mr.  
Apthorp, who wen- both so connected with  
this town, that they might almost be consid­  
ered inhabitants of it. I may say that my  
eyes opened upon books of controversy.  
When I removed to Worcester in 1755, I  
found that County hot with controversy be­  
tween the parties of Mr. Buckminster and  
Mr. Millen. 1 became acquainted with Dyer,  
Doolittle and Baldwin, three notable dispu­  
tants.* Mr. Maccarty, though a Calvinist, was  
not a bigot, but the town was a scene of dis­  
putes all the time 1 lived there. When I left  
them, I entered into a scene of other disputa­  
tions at the bar, and not long afterwards, dis­  
putations of another kind in politicks. In  
later times I have lived with Atheists, Deists,  
and Scepticks; with Cardinals, Archbishops,  
Bishqps, Deans and Priests, of the Church of  
England—with Tanner, Price, Priestly, Kip­  
pis, Rees, Lindsey, Disney and Jebb; with  
the English and Scottish Clergy in Holland,  
and especially with Dr. Maclean at the Hague.  
I have conversed freely with most of the sects  
in America, and have not been wholly inat­  
tentive to the writings and reasonings of all  
these denominations of Christians and Philos­  
ophers. You may well suppose, then, that I  
have had controversy enough ; but after all, I  
declare to you that your twenty-nme sermons  
have expressed the result of all my reading,  
experience, and reflection, in a manner more  
satisfactory to me than I could have done in  
the best days of my strength.  
“ The most afflictive circumstances that I

* Quincy, JANUARY 21, 1823,  
  
“ Dear Sir,—! thank you for your kind letter of the  
30th December, and above all for the gift of a precions  
volume.—lIt is a chain of diamonds set in links of gold,  
I have never read or heard a volume of sermons better  
calculated or adapted to the age and country in which  
it was wriften, How different from the sermons I heard  
and read in the town of Worcester from the year 1755  
to 1758. As my destiny in life has been somewhat un-  
common, I must beg pardon for indulging in a little ego-  
tism.—I may say I was born and bred in the centre of  
Theological and Ecclesiastical controversy. A sermon  
of Mr. Bryant, Minister of the parish who lived on the  
spot now a part of the farm on which I Jive, occasioned  
the controversy between him and Mr. Miles, Mr. Por-  
ter, Mr. Bass, and many others; it broke out like the  
eruption of a voleano, and blazed with portentous as-  
pect for many years. The death of Dr. Miller the Epis-  
copal Minister of this town, produced the controversy  
between Dr. Mahew and Mr. Apthrop, who were both  
so connected with this town, that they might almost be  
considered inhabitants of it. 1 may say that my eyes  
opened upon books of controversy between the parties  
of Mr. Buckminster, and Mr. Miller:—J] became ac-  
quainted with Dyer, Doolittie, and Baldwin, three no-  
table disputants, Mr. M’Carty, though a Calvinist was  
not a bigot, but the town of Worcester was a sceve of  
disputes all the time | was there; when I left] enter-  
ed into a scene of other disputations at the bar and not  
long afterwards disputations of another kind in politics.  
in latter times | have lived with Atheists, Deists, Scep-  
tics; with Cardinals, Archbishops, Monks, Friars of the  
Roman Catholic persuasion ; with Archbishops, Bishops,  
Deans, and Priests of the Church of England; with  
Farmer, Price, Priestly, Kippis, Rees, Derring, and  
Jebb; with the English and Scotish Clergy in Holland,  
and especially with Dr. Maclean atthe Hague. J have  
conversed freely with most of the sects in America, and  
have not been wholly inattentive to the writings and  
reasonings of all these denominations of Christians and  
Philosophers ;—you may well suppose then, that] have  
had controversy enough, but after all | declare to you  
that your twenty-nine sermons have expressed the re-  
sult of all my reading, experience, and reflection in a  
manner more tatisfactory to me than I conld have done  
in the best days of my strength.

Quincy, Jan. 24, 1823.  
  
_ Dear Sir—I thank you for your kind letter of December  
30th, and above all for the gift of a precious volume. It is a  
‘chain of diamonds, set in links of gold. I have never read,  
or heard read, a volume of sermons better calculated and  
adapted to the age and country in which it was written. How  
different from the sermons I heard, and read in the town of  
Worcester, from the years 1755 to 1758.  
  
As my destiny in life has been somewhat uncommon, I must  
_beg your pardon for indulging in a little egotism. I may say  
I was born and bred in the centre of Tieological, and Ecclesias-  
tical controversy. A sermon of Mr. Bryant, minister of this  
Parish, who lived on a spot, now a part of the farm on which  
I live, occasioned the controversy be¢ween him and Mr. Niles,  
Mr. Porter, Mr. Bass, and many others, which broke out like  
the eruption of a volcano, and blazed with portentous aspect  
for many years. ‘The death of Dr. Miller, the Episcopalian  
Minister of this town, produced a controversy between Dr.  
Mayhew and Mr. Apthorpe, who were both so connected with  
this town, that they might almost be considered as inhabitants  
of it. I may almost say, that my eyes opened upon books of  
controversy. WhenI removed to Worcester, in 1755, I found  
that county hot with controversy between the parties ef Mr.  
Buckminster and Mr. Mellen. I. became acquainted with  
Dyer, Doolittle and Baldwin, three notable disputants.* Mr.  
Macarty, though a Calvinist, was not a bigot, but the town  
‘was a scene of disputes all the time I lived there. When I  
left them, I entered into a scene of other disputations at the  
bar, and not long afterwards disputations of another kind in  
_ politics. In later times, I have lived with Atheists, Deists,  
and,.sceptics, with Cardinals, Archbishops, Monks, Priests  
and Friars of the Roman Catholic persuasion; with Arch-  
bishops, Bishops, Deans and Priests of the Church of Eng-  
land. With Farmer, Price, Priestly, Kippis, Rees, Lindsey,  
Disney, and Jebb. With the English and Scottish Clergy in  
Holland, and especially with Dr. Maclain, at the Hague—I

Quincy, Jan, 21, 1825.  
Dear Sir,—*I thank you for your kind letter  
  
‘of the 30th Dec, and above all for the gift of a  
  
precious volume. I; is a chain of diamonds set  
in links of gold, I have never read, or heard a  
volume of sermons better calculated or adapted  
to the age and country in which it was writen.  
How different from the sermons I heard and  
read in the town of Worcester, from the year  
1755 to 1758. As my destiny in life has been  
somewhat uncommon, I must beg pardon for in-  
dulging in a little egotism. IT may say T[ was  
born and bred in the centre of theological and  
ecclesiastical controversy. A sermon of Mr.  
Bryant, minister of the parish, who lived on the  
spot now a part of the farm in which I live,  
occasioned the controversy between him and  
Mr, Bass and many  
others. It broke out like the eruption of a  
volcano, and blazed with portentous aspect for  
The death of Dr. Miller, the  
Episcopal Minister of this town, (Quincy) pro-  
duced the controversy between Dr, Mayhew  
and Mr. Apthorp, who were both so connected  
with this town, that they might almost be  
considered inhabitants of it. I may say that my  
eyes opened upon dooks of controversy between  
the parties of Mr. Buckminster and Mr, Mellen,  
1 became acquainted with Dyer, Doolittle  
and Baldwin, three notable disputants. Mr.  
M’Carty, though a calvinist, was not a bigot;  
but the town of Worcester was a scene of dis-  
putes all the tine 1 was there, When I left,  
l entered into a scene of other disputations at  
the bar; and hot long afterwards disputations  
of another kind in politics. In later times, 1  
have lived with Atheist, Deists, Sceptics ; with  
Cardinals, Archbishops, Monks, Friars of the  
Roman Catholic persuasion ; with Archbishops,  
Bishops, Deans and Priests of the church of  
England ; with Farmer, Price, Priestley, Kippis,  
Rees, Lindsey and Disney and Jebb; with the  
English and Scottish clergy in Holland, and  
especially with Dr. Maclean -at the Hague.  
I have conversed freely with most of the sects  
in America, and have not been wholly inatten-  
tive to the writings and reasonings of all these  
denominations of Christians and Philosophers.
