The Examination. (concluded)    
Number XVIII.  
[New York, April 8, 1802]  
In order to cajole the people, the Message abounds with all the common-place of popular harrangue, and prefers claims of merit, for circumstances of equivocal or of trivial value. With pompous absurdity are we told of the “multiplication of men, susceptible of happiness,” (as if this susceptibility were a privilege peculiar to our climate) “habituated to self-government, and valuing its blessings above all price.” Fortunate will it be, if the present favorites of the people, do not, before their reign is at an end, transform those blessings into curses, so serious and heavy, as to make even Despotism a desirable refuge from the Elysium of Democracy.  
In a country, the propensities of which are opposed even to necessary burdens, an alarm is attempted to be excited about the general tendency of Government, “to leave to labor the smallest portion of its earnings, on which it can subsist, and to consume the residue of what it was instituted to guard.” It might have been well, to have explained whether it is the whole of the earnings of labor, which government is instituted to guard, or only the residue after deducting what is necessary to enable it to fulfil the duty of protection. Representatives who share with their constituents in an excessive jealousy of Executive abuses, are cantingly admonished to “circumscribe discretionary powers over money,” though they are known to be already so limited, as that the Executive, even on the prospect of a rupture with a foreign power, would not possess the means of obtain[in]g intelligence the most necessary for the proper direction of its measures. That the new administration has not boldly invaded the laws and withheld the funds applicable to the payment of principal and interest of the public debt, is fastidiously proclaimed as evidence that “the public faith has been exactly maintained.” The praise of a spirit of economy is attempted to be gained, by the suppression of a trifling number of officers, (a majority of whom had become unnecessary by the mere change of circumstances) and by declaiming, with affectation, against “the multiplication of officers and the increase of expense.” The proposition to reduce our insignificant military establishment (the actual number of troops probably not exceeding that which is intended to be retained) cannot be suggested, without tickling our ears with the trite but favorite maxim, that “a standing army ought not to be kept up in time of peace.” To make a display of concern for their prosperity—agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation are introduced among the pageants of the piece; but, except as “to protection from casual embarrassments,” we are sagaciously informed that these “Great Pillars of our prosperity, ought to be left to take care of themselves.” The carrying trade, however, seems to engage more solicitude; no doubt that we may be terrified by the expectation of future evils, from a much traduced instrument,  
The Treaty with Great Britain  
which in time past, has done nothing but good, in spite of the gloomy predictions of patriotic seers.  
Such are the minor features of this curious performance. Had these been its only blemishes, a regard to national reputation would have forbidden a comment; but connected as they are with schemes of innovation replete with great present mischief, and still greater future danger; designed as they are to varnish over projects which threaten to precipitate our nation from an enviable height of prosperity to that low and abject state, from which it was raised by the establishment and wise administration of our present government—they become intitled to notice as additional indications of character and disposition.  
The merits of the Message have now been pretty fully discussed; but before it is dismissed, it may be useful to take a view of it in another and a different light as one link in a chain of testimony, which the force of circumstances, at every step of the new administration, extorts from them, in favor of their predecessors.  
The President, on the threshhold of office, at the first opportunity of speaking to his constituents, in his very inaugural speech; full of a truth, which the most rancorous prejudice cannot obscure, and not sufficiently reflecting on the inferences which would be drawn, proclaims aloud to the world, that a government, which he had disapproved in its institution and virulently opposed in its progress, was in The Full Tide of Successfull Experiment. In the last address he again unconsciously becomes the panygerist of those whom he seeks to depreciate. The situation in which (humanly speaking) we have been preserved by the prudent and firm councils of the preceding administrations, amidst the revolutionary and convulsive throes, amidst the desolating conflicts of Europe, is there a theme of emphatic gratulation. It shall not be forgotten, as the solitary merit of the address, that we are reminded of the gratitude due to heaven for the blessings of this situation. Amidst the spurious symptoms of a spirit of reform, it is consoling to observe one, which, in charity, ought to be supposed genuine. But it would not have diminished our conviction of its sincerity, if the instruments of Providence in the accomplishment of the happy work, had not been entirely overlooked; since this would have been evidence of a willingness to acknowledge and retract error—to make reparation for injury. But tho’ they have been overlooked by the Message, the American people ought never for a moment to forget them. Their efforts and their struggles, their moderation and their energy, their care and their foresight; the mad and malignant opposition of their political adversaries; the charges of pusillanimity and perfidy lavished on the Declaration of neutrality; the resistance to measures for avoiding a rupture with Great Britain; the attempt to rush at once into reprisals; the cry for war with the enemies of France, as the enemies of Republican liberty; all these things should be forever imprinted on the memory of a just and vigilant nation. And in recollecting them, they should equally recollect that the opposers of the salutary plans to which they are so much indebted, were and are the zealous partizans of the present Head of our Government; who have at all times submitted to his influence and implicitly obeyed his nod; who never would have pursued with so much vehemence the course they did, had they known it to be contrary to the views of their Chief: nor should it be forgotten that this Chief in the negociation with the British Minister, conducted by him as Secretary of State, acted precisely as if it had been his design to widen, not to heal the breach between the two countries; that he at first objected to the Declaration of neutrality; was afterwards reluctantly dragged into the measures connected with it; was believed by his friends not to approve the system of conduct, of which he was the official organ; was publicly and openly accused by the then agent of the French Republic with duplicity and deception, with having been the first to inflame his mind with ill impressions of the principles and views of leading characters in our Government, not excepting the revered Washington; that this Chief, at a very critical period of our affairs in reference to the war of Europe, withdrew from the direction of that department peculiarly charged with the management of our foreign relations, evidently to avoid being more deeply implicated in the consequences of the position, which had been assumed by the Administration; but on the hollow pretence of a dislike to public life and a love of philosophic retirement. Citizens of America—mark the sequel and learn from it instruction! You have been since agitated to the center, to raise to the first station in your Government, the very man who, at a conjuncture when your safety and your welfare demanded his stay, early relinquished a subordinate, but exalted and very influential post, on a pretence as frivolous as it has proved to be insincere! Was he, like the virtous Washington, forced from a beloved retreat, by the unanimous and urgent call of his country? No: he stalked forth the Champion of Faction, having never ceased in the shade of his retreat, by all the arts of intrigue, to prepare the way to that elevation, for which a restless ambition impatiently panted.  
The undesigned eulogy of the men, who have been slandered out of the confidence of their fellow-citizens, has not been confined to the situation of the country, as connected with the war of Europe. In the view given of the very flourishing state of our finances, the worst of the calumnies against those men is refuted, and it is admitted, that in this article of vital importance to the public welfare, their measures have been provident and effectual beyond example. To the charge of a design to saddle the nation with a perpetual debt, a plain contradiction is given by the concession, that the provisions which have been made for it are so ample, as even to justify the relinquishment of a part no less considerable than the whole of the internal revenue. The same proposal testifies the brilliant success of our fiscal system generally; and that it is more than equal to all that has been undertaken, to all that has been promised to the nation.  
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury, as published, confirms this high commendation of the conduct of the former administrations. After relieving each state from the burden of its particular debt, by assuming the payment of it on account of the United States, in addition to the general debt of the nation; after settling the accounts between the states relatively to their exertions for the common defence in our revolutionary war, and providing for the balances found due to such of them as were creditors; after maintaining with complete success, an obstinate and expensive war with the Indian tribes; after making large disbursements for the suppression of two insurrections against the Government; after liberal contributions to the Barbary powers to induce them to open to our merchants the trade of the Mediterranean; after incurring a responsibility for indemnities to a large amount, due to British merchants, in consequence of infractions of the Treaty of peace by some of the states; after heavy expenditures for creating and supporting a navy and for other preparations, to guard our independence and territory against the hostilities of a foreign nation; after  the accomplishment of all these very important objects, it is now declared to the United States by the present head of the Treasury, by the confidential minister of the present Chief Magistrate, the most subtil and implacable of the enemies of the former administrations, “That the actual revenues of the Union are sufficient, to defray all the expences civil and military of Government, to the extent authorised by existing laws, to meet All the Engagements of the United States; and to discharge in fifteen years and a half, The Whole of Our Public Debt”—foreign as well as domestic, new as well as old. Let it be understood, that the revenues spoken of were all provided under the two first administrations; and that the “existing laws” alluded to, were all passed under the same administrations; consequently, that the revenues had not been increased, nor the expences diminished by the men who now hold the reins: and then let it be asked, whether so splendid a result does not reflect the highest credit on those, who in times past, have managed the affairs of the Nation? Does not the picture furnish matter not only for consolation, but even for exultation to every true friend of his country? And amidst the joy which he must feel in the contemplation, can he be so unjust as to refuse the tribute of commendation to those, by whose labors his country has been placed on so fair an eminence? Will he endure to see any part of the fruits of those labors blasted or hazarded, by a voluntary surrender of any portion of the means which are to insure the advantages of so bright a prospect?  
In vain will envy or malevolence reply, “The happy situation in which we are placed is to be attributed not to the labors of those who have heretofore conducted our affairs, but to an unforeseen and unexpected progress of our country.” Candor and truth will answer—Praise is always due to public men who take their measures in such a manner as to derive to the nation the benefit of favorable circumstances which are possible, as well as of those which are foreseen. If proportionate provision had not been made, concurrently with the progress of our national resources, the effect of them would not have been felt as to the past, and would not have been matured as to the future.  
  
But why should it be pretended that this progress was not anticipated? In past experience there were many data for calculation. The ratio of the increase of our population had been observed and stated; the extent and riches of our soil were known; the materials for commercial enterprize were no secret; the probable effect of the measures of the government to foster and encourage navigation, trade and industry, was well understood; and especially, the influence of the means, which were adapted to augment our active capital, and to supply a fit and adequate medium of circulation, towards the increase of national wealth, was declared and insisted upon, in official reports. Though adventitious circumstances may have aided the result, it is certain, that a penetrating and comprehensive mind could be at no loss to foresee a progress of our affairs, similar to what has been experienced. Upon this anticipation the assumption of the state debts, and other apparently bold measures of the government were avowedly predicated, in opposition to the feeble &amp; contracted views of the Little Politicians, who now triumph in the success of their arts, and enjoy the benefits of a policy, which they had neither the wi[s]dom to plan nor the spirit to adopt—idly imagining that the cunning of a demagogue and the talents of a statesman are synonymous. Consummate in the paltry science of courting and winning popular favor, they falsely infer that they have the capacity to govern, and they will be the last to discover their error. But let them be assured that the people will not long continue the dupes of their pernicious sorceries. Already, the cause of truth has derived this advantage from the crude essays of their Chief, that the film has been removed from many an eye. The credit of great abilities was allowed him by a considerable portion of those who disapproved his principles; but the short space of nine months has been amply sufficient to dispel that illusion; and even some of his most partial votaries begin to suspect, that they have been mistaken in the Object of Their Idolatry.

IN order to cajole the people, themes.&#x27;

susceptibility were : privilege peculiar to

meat, and making it: blzsingr above all I

sent favorites of the pe0ple, do not, before  
their reign is at an end, transfortn those  
blelsings into curses, so serious and heavy  
as to make even despotism a desirable te.

In a country, the propenfities of which i  
are Opposed even to necessary bo-rdens, an ]  
alarm- is-attempted to be excited about the ?  
eneral tendency of government, &quot; to leave ]  
to labor the finally? portion of its earnings,  
on which it can subsistj &#x27;and to caigsume tbt&#x27;  
rg/Za&#x27;ue ofwhich it was instituted to guard.&quot;  
It might have been well, to have exPlain.  
sied whether it is the whole of the earnings  
of labor, which government is initituted  
- to guard-, or only the rctsidue after the de. ;  
duding what is ueceﬀhry to enable it to}

are cantingly admomshed to &#x27; cirCumzcnbe  
discretionary powers over money ;&quot; tho&#x27;  
they areknown tobe already so limited,  
as that the executive, even on the prospecss  
.ofa rupture with a soreign. power, would  
not possess the means of obtaining intel­  
ligence the most necessary&#x27;ssfor the proper  
direction of its measures. That the new

laws and withheld .the funds applicablc ;  
to the payrncnt of principal and interest \
of the public debt, it fastidiously proclaiin- ss

been exactly maintained.&quot; The praise of  
asispiritssof&#x27; cconomysi is attempted to be  
gained, by the suppresiion of a triliing  
number of officers, (a majori&#x27;ty of sswhom

gacioutly informed that these &quot; casu­  
!ILLARS of our Prosperity, ought to be  
left to take care qf&#x27;themjelmt.&#x27; The carry­  
ing trade, however, eesins to engage more  
solicitude ; no doubt that we may be ter­  
rified by the eXpectation of future evils,  
from a much traduced in strumentfi which  
in time past, has done nothing but good  
.in spite of the—gloomy predictions ofpa.  
triotic seers.  
  
Such are the minor features of this on.  
tious performance. ct—Had these been its  
only blemishes, a regard to national re.  
putation would have forbidden a comment;  
but connected as they are with schemes of  
innovation replete with great present simis.

ty to that low and assbject (late, from which  
it was raised by the establishment and wise  
administration of our present government;  
they became entitled to notice as additi.  
onal indications of character &amp; disposition.  
The merits of the message have now  
been pretty fully discussed ; but before it  
is &#x27;dismisied, it may be usefu—l to take a  
view of it in another and different light ;  
  
as one link in a chain of testimony, which  
  
the force of circumﬀances, at every step  
ofthe new administration, extorts from  
them, in favor of their predecessors.  
.The-President, on the threshold of of.  
fice, at the first Opportunity of speaking  
to his constituents, in his very inaugural  
speech ; full of a truth, which the most  
rancorous prejudice cannot ohscure, and  
oot_suﬄcien—tly reﬂecting on the inferences  
which would be drawn, proctaims aloud.  
to the world, that : government, which  
  
, The Tutty with Great-Brt&#x27;sain.  
  
  
hehad disapprovesid in its indication andss  
virulently opposed in its progress, was in&quot;  
the full tide of successful experiment. In  
the last address he again unconsciouﬂy  
becomes the panygesirist of those whom he  
seek&#x27;s to deprecate. The situation in which  
(humanly speaking) we have been pre­  
served by the prudent and firm councils  
  
ss-of-the preceding administrations, amidst  
  
the revolutionary and convulctfive throes,  
amidst the desolating conﬂicts of Europe,  
is there a theme of emphatic gratulation.  
  
ss It shall not be forgotten, as the solitary  
si merit of the address, that we are remind­  
ss ed of the gratitudedue to Heart)&quot;: for the  
f blesiings us this iituatien. Amidst the

l  
  
  
spurioas symptoms of a spirit of resorm, it  
is consoling to observe one, which, in  
charity, ought to be supposed genuine.  
But it&#x27;would not have diminished our con.  
viction of its sincerity, if the instruments  
of Providence in the accomplishment of  
the happy work, had not been entirely  
over-looked ; since this would have been ;  
evidence of a willingness to acknowledge  
and retract error; to make reparation ror  
injury. But though they have been over­  
looke&#x27;d by the message, the Amerioan peo­  
ple ought never for a moment to forget  
them. Their eﬀorts and their struggles,  
their moderation and their energy, their  
care and their foresight ; the mad and ma!  
  
  
lignant opposition of their politit-al adver­  
saries ; the charges of pustllanimity and  
perfid) lavished on the declaration of neu­  
trality ; the reslslance to measures for a­  
voided a rupture with GreatsissBritain; the  
attempt to rush at once into reprisals; the  
cry for war with the enemies of Fiance,  
as the enemies of republican liberty ; all  
these things should be sore ver imprinted on  
the memory of a just and vigilant nation.  
And in recollecring them, they should ss  
equally recollect that the opposero of the ss  
salumry plans, to which they are so much  
indebted, were and-are the zealous partiil  
zans of the present head osout govern. i  
ment; who have at all times submitted ss  
to his inﬂuence and implicitly obeyed his !  
nod; who never would have pursued with  
.so much vehemence the course they did,  
had they known it to be contrary to the.  
—views of their chief; nor should it be for.  
otten that this chief, in the negociation  
with the British minister, conducted thy  
him as Secretary of State, after-i.: preCise.  
ly as ifssit had been his design to widen,  
not to heal—the breach between the two  
countries; that-heiat first objectesi! to the  
declaration-sisios neutrality ; was asterwards  
[reiuctsntly rdragged into the measures  
connected with it; was believed by his ss  
friendsnot to approve the system ot con­  
duct, of which he was the official organ ;  
was publicly and Openly accused by the  
then agent of theFrench republic with  
dnplicity and deception, withhaving been  
the first to inﬂame his mind with ill im.  
resstons of -the principles and views of  
leading characters in our government, not  
exeepting the reverend W&#x27;ashington; that  
this chief, at a very critical period of&quot; our  
affairs in reference to the war os Eurossx,  
withdrew from the direction of that de­  
partment, peculiarly charged with the  
management of our forcign relations, evi­  
dently to avoid being deeply implicated .  
in the consequences of the position, which  
had been assumed by the administration ;  
1 but on the hollow pretence osassdifiike to  
ss public life and a love of philosophical re­  
ss tirement. Citizens os Ameriea—mark  
the sequel and learn srom instruction !—  
You have since been agitated to the cen.  
ter, to raise to -_the first statiun in your.  
government, they very man who, at a  
conjuncture when your safety andyeui  
welfare demanded his stay, early relin.  
quished a subordinate, but exalted and ve­  
ry insiuential post, on a pretence as stivi.  
lous as it has proved insincere! Was he  
like the virtuous Washington, ssisirced from  
a beloved retreat, by the unanimuus and  
urgent call ofhis country ? No : he stalk.  
ed forth the champion ot&#x27;sacttun-ss-having  
never ceased in the shade of his retreat,  
by all the arts of intrigue, to prepare the  
way to&#x27; that elevation, for which a resist.  
less ambition impatiently panted. L  
  
  
  
  
The undesigned eulogy of the men,  
who have beenstana&#x27;ered out as the consi.  
deare of their-fellow. citichsizs, has not been  
confined to the situation oftbe country,  
as connected with the was of Europe. In  
the view given of the very ﬂourishing  
state of our finances, the worst ofsicalum­  
nie: against those men is resuted, and it is  
admitted, that in this article of vital im- &quot;  
penance to the public welfare, their mea­  
sures have been provident and eﬀectpal be­  
yond example. To the charge osa de­  
sign to saddle the nation with a perpetual  
debt, a Plain concradiction is given by the  
  
  
been made-for it are so ample, as even to  
justiiy the rclinquishment of a part no less  
considerable than the our/20]: of the internal  
reft-mue. The same proposal testitssies the  
brilliant success osour fiscal system gene­  
rallv ; and that it is more&#x27;than equal to  
all that has been undertaken, to all that  
has been promised to the nation.  
The report of the secretary of the trea­  
  
sicctozzeeﬂensict&#x27; that the provifions which have &#x27;

not only for consolation, but even for ex.  
ultation to every true friend to his counss

feel in the eontemplation, can he be so un.  
just as to refuse the tribute of commenda.  
tion to these, by whose labors his cauntry  
has been placed on so fair an eminence ?  
Will he endure to see any part of the fruits  
of those labors blasted or hazarded, by a

means which are to insure the advantages  
of so b&#x27;rfght a &quot;&#x27;t-respect?  
&#x27; In vam will envy or malevolence re.

and would nor have been matured as to

But why should it be pretended that  
this progress was not anticipated ? In past  
cxPerlence there were many data for cal.  
culation. The ratio of the increase ok&#x27;our  
population had been observed and stated ;  
the extcnt and riches of our soil were  
known ; the materials sor commercial en­  
terprize were no secret; the probable es...  
sect of the measures of the government to

specially, the inﬂuence of the means,  
which were adapted to augment our ac.

IN order to cajole the people, the MefTage  
abounds with all the commonplace of popular  
hairangne, and prefers claims ot merit, for cir

form thole bleffings into curfes, fo ferious and  
heavy, as to make even defpotifm a defirable  
xeluge from th: Elytium of Democracy.  
In a country, the propenfuies of which are  
oppoied even to neceilary burdens, an alarm is  
attempted to be excited about the general ten­  
dency of Government, t; to leave to labour the  
fnallef of its earnings, on which it can i&#x27;ubfift,  
and to eonjumt the ref due of what it was infiitut­

have expl lined whether it is the othole of the eai n.

what is nectfliry to enable it to fulfil the duty of

they are with fehemes of innovation replete  
with great prefect mifehief, and ft ill greet&quot; r  
future danger ; defigned as they are to varnifh  
orer projects which th’eaten to precir&gt;itafe oar

to notice as additional indications of charter  
and difpofttion.  
The merits of the Mdfige nave now been  
pretty fully difeufled ; but before it is difmiir  
ed, it may be ufeful to take,a view of it in afcp  
ther and a d-ftcreni light ; as one link in a  
chain of teftimony, which the force ol circum­  
fiances, at every ftep ot the new admrnifirdt&#x27;on,  
exiorts from them, in favor of their predecef

The Piefidfnt. ’on the threfhold of offi.e, at  
the fit ft opportunity of fpeakiog to his ccollit­  
uenU, in his very inaugural fpeech ; full of a  
truth, which the moft rancorous prejudice can.  
not obfeure, and not fufficiently rtfiefling on  
the inferences which would be drawn, pro.  
claims aloud to the world, that a government,  
which he had difapproved in its irftitution and  
virulently oppofed in its progrefs, was in the  
FULL TIDE OF SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT. In  
the laft addrefs he again unconfcioufly becomes  
the panegvrift of tliofc whom he feeks to depre.  
ciate. The fituation in which (huuuniy fpeak­  
ing) we have been preferred by ibe prudent  
and rm councils of the preceding admimltia­  
tions, amidrt the revolutionary and convultive  
throes, armdtl the deiolaring confl &lt;fts of Eu  
rope, is there a theme of emphatic gratulation.  
It ftiali not be forgotten, as the folicary merit  
of the addreG, that we are reminded of the  
gratitude due to heaven i t the bJe(lings of this  
fituation.—Amidit-the fpuii us fym; t ms of a  
fpirit of ref orm, it is confiding to obferve one,  
which, in charity, ought to be (uppofed genuine.  
But it would not have dior.nifhcd our convitft­  
ion of its Sincerity, if the iujlrnments ot Provi­  
dence m the accomplilhment of ihe happy work,  
had not been entirely ovei looked ; fince this  
would hive been evidence of a willmgnef* to  
acknowledge and retract error, to make repar­  
ation for injury. But though they have been  
overlooked by »he meffige, the American peo­  
ple ought never for a moment to forget them.  
Their efforts and their ftruggles, their modera­  
tion and their energy, their cart and meir  
forefight; the mad And malignant oppofuion  
cf their political adverfaries $ the charges ot  
pufiilanimity and perfidy Uvifiied on the det*  
laration of neutrality ; the refiftance to mea­  
fures for avoiding a rupture with Great Brit  
ain j the attempt to riifh at once into reprifals j  
the cry for war with the enemies of France, as  
the enemies of republican liberty ; all thefe  
things fhould be forever imprinted on the mem­  
ory of a juft and vigilant nation. And in re­  
collcdling them, they liquid equally recollcfit  
that the oppefers of the falutary plans to which  
they are fo much indebted, were and are the  
zealous partizans of the prefent Head of our  
Government *, who have at all times fubm it ted  
to his influence, and impliciily obeyed his nod ;  
who never would have purfaed with lb much  
vehemence the cotirfe they did, had they known  
it to be comrary to the views of their Chief :  
nor Ihould it be forgotten that this chief, in the  
negociation wiih the Britifh miniller, conduced  
by him as Secretary of State, afted precifely as  
it it had been his defign to widen, not to heal  
the breach between the iwo countries ; that he

his mind with i 1 imprc Hons of the princip es  
and views of le.«d ng characters in our Gov-j  
ernment, not excepting the revered Wafhing­  
ton-;—that this Chief, at a very critical period  
ofouratLirs in reference to the w!r of Eu  
rope, withdrew frem the ditetfion of that de*  
partment peculiarly charged with the manage­  
ment of our foreign relations, evidently to a  
void being mere deeply implicated in the edn  
feq-iences of the pofit&#x27;on, which had been »f  
fumed by the admlnilhation hut on the hoi  
low pretence of a difl ke to public bfe and a  
love to philofrphic retirement. Citizens of  
America-mark the fequel, and learn from  
i. inftru&amp;icn ! Yon have been fince agitated  
to the centre, to raife to the firft ftation in your  
government, the very man whb, at a conjunc­

all the arts of intrigue, to prepare the way to

The iindefigried eti’ogy rf the men who have  
leen flanaerea out oj the confidence of their ft How citi­  
zens, has mot been confined to the fi.nation of  
the country, as coonefteci with the war of Eu  
rope. In the view given of he very 8 urifh r.g  
Rate of our finances, rhe worft ot the calum  
ri~s againft thofe men ic refuted ; and it rs .’d  
niitted. that i.&#x27; th&#x27;s article of vital impor an~e  
to the public welt are, their rreafu&#x27;re&gt; have been  
provident and elR&lt;ftc tl beyond example.— To  
the charge of a dr fign in fiddle the na&#x27;ion with  
a perpetual debt, a plain contradiction is given  
by the conceffion. that the provisoes which  
have been made for it are fo ample, as even  
to juflify the relinquilhment of a part no lcf&gt;  
conhderable than the whole of the infernal reven  
ue.—&#x27;Ihefaine propofa 1 teftifies the brilliant luc­  
cefs of our fifeal fyftem generally ; and ihffc it is  
more than equil to all that has been undertaken,  
to all that has been pomiftd to the ration.  
The report of the Secretary of the Treafury,  
as publilhed, confirms this high commendation  
ol the conduct of the former adminifiratiom* After  
relieving each ftate from the burden csf its par  
  
ticular debt, by attaining tne payment or it on  
account of the United States, in arid tion to the  
general debt of the nation; after fettling the  
accounts between the dates relatively to their  
exertions for the con.mon defence in our  
revolutionary war, and providing for the bal  
ances found due to fuch of them as were credi­  
tors ; alter maintaining, with complete fuccefs,  
an ohftinate and expensive war with ihe Indian  
tribes; after making large difburfements for  
the fuppiefllon of two infuiregions ag-rinfl the  
government ; aftet liberal contributions to the  
liarbary powers to induce them to open to our  
merchants t he trade of the Mediterranean ; af.  
ter incurring a refponfibilicy for indemnities  
to a large amounr, due to Biitifti merchants in  
confequence of in&#x27;Vadlions of the treaty of peace  
by fome t f the dates ; after heavy expenditures  
for creating and fuppo.ting a navy,and for ether  
prepxi rttions to gaurd our independence Sc terito­  
ry agatnft the holtiliies of a foreign nation ; af  
ter the accompl Ihment of all thefe very impor­  
tant obje£b, it b now declared to the United  
States by the prefent head of the Treriury, by  
the confidential n inifter of the prefent Chief  
Magiftrate, the mnft fubt l and imp&#x27; icable of  
the enemies of the former adnajniftratinns,  
«• That the actual revenues of the Union are fuffi­  
cient to defray all expences civil and military of  
government,/® the exf t authorijed by exijting laws ;  
to meet all the engagements oftheUnit*d  
States, and to difeharge, in fifteen yean and an  
half THE WHOLE OF OUR fUBUC DIET, foreign  
as well as donieftic, new as well as oiL’* Let  
it be underftood that the revenues f oolcen of  
were all provid&#x27;d under the two frji amrunijir aliens ;  
and that the “ exifting laws” allirded to* were I  
all paiTcd under the fame administration ; con  
fequently, that the revenues had not been tncreafed.  
nor the expends dimir.ijbtd, by the men who now  
hold the rt ins : and then let it be a Iked, whether  
fo fplendid a refult dee* not reflect rhe higheft  
credit on thofe who, in times pail, have man a  
ged the affairs of the Nation ? Does not the  
picture furnifh matter not only for confolation  
but even for exultation to every true friend of  
his country f And amidft the joy which he j  
muft feel in the contemp aticn, can he be fo  
unjuft as to refute the tribute of commendation  
to thofe, by whofe labours his country has been  
placed on fo fair an emmence ? Will he endure  
to fee any part of the fruits of thofe labours  
blafted or hazarded, by a voluntary furrender  
of any portion ot the means which are to iefure  
the advantages of fo br ght a profped ?  
In vain wi’l envy or malevolence reply,  
“ Th« happy fituation in which we are placed,  
is to be attributed not to the labours of thofe  
wh» have heretofore conduced our affairs, but ,  
  
to an nnforefecn and unexpe&amp;cd progrefs of  
our c°untry.** Candour and truth will anfwrr  
—Pr*ife isalw&lt;y doe to public men who lake

been mtdconcur ently whli the progref&quot; of  
our natio al V:*fju ccs,the ciFrifl of them would  
not have been felt as to the paft, and would not  
have been manured as to the future.  
Btit why fnould it be pretended that this pro­  
grefs was rot anticipated ? In pad experience  
there were many d»ta for calculation. Toe ra.  
tio of the increafeof our p°pu^don had been  
obferVed and dated ; the exrent and riches of  
our foil were known ; the materials for com.  
rrercial enterprize were no fecret 5 the probable  
etfe-d of tire meafares of the government to  
fodeV and encourage navigation, trade, a sd in­  
duftry, was well tmderdood : and especially,  
the influence of the means, which a cre adapted  
to augment our a&amp;lve capital, and to fjpply a  
fit and adequate medium of circulation toward*  
the mcieaie of national wealth, was declared  
and infilled uf c in official reports. Though  
adventitious circumd?.nces may have aided thfr  
refult, it is certain, that a pene&#x27;rafng and com*  
prehendve mind could be at no lofs to forefcfc  
a progrefs of our affairs, fimilar to what has  
been experienced. Upon this anticipati n the  
afTumprion of the date debts, and other appar­  
ently bold me-ifures cf the government, U-ere a­  
vowedly predicated, in opposition to the feeble  
5c contrafted views of the little politicians,  
who now triumph in the fuceefs of their arcs,  
and er.joy the benefits of a policy, whi h they  
had neither the wifdcm fo pi in cr the fpirit to  
adopt, idly imagining that the cunning of a  
demagogue and the talents of a d-itefman are  
fynonyrnous Confummatb in the paltry lciencC  
if conning and winning popular favour, they  
falfely infer that they have the capacity togov.  
cm, and they will be the lad to difeover their  
error. But let them be affured that the peo­  
ple will not long continue the dupes of their per­  
nicious forceries. Alreadv the caufe of truth  
has derived this advantage f om the crude ef­  
fays of their Chief, that the film has been  
removed from many an eve —The credit of  
great abilities was allowed him by a confiJera.  
bic port’on i f thofe \*h&#x27;&gt; disapproved his princi­  
plcv ; but the fh -rt fpace of-’ine months has  
been amply fufticient to d fpu that ibufion *  
and even feme Sf hi&#x27;&#x27; mofl partial votaries be­  
gin to fufpttf, that they have been mdl.ikenia
