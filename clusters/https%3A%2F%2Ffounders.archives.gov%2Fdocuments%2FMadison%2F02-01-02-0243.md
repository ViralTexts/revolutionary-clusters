France ceded to  
Spain the island of New Orleans and all  
her possessions west of the Mississippi river,  
and the name of Louisiana was thus lim-  
ited to that part of the valley. After the  
close of the revolutionary war, in settling  
the boundaries of the United States, some  
contentions arose between our own and the  
Spanish government, especially as regarded  
the free navigation of the Mississippi.—  
These differences were not adjusted until  
1795, when, during the administration of  
Washington, his Catholic Majesty agreed  
by the treaty of San Lorenzo, that “ the  
citizens of the United States shall be  
permitted, for the space of three years  
from this time, the navigation of the Mis-  
sissippi, with a right to deposit their mer-  
chandise and effects in the port of New  
Orleans.” From several causes, however,  
this treaty was not fulfilled vntil 1798,  
and, most probably, but for a change of  
administration here, a war between Spain  
and the United States would have been the  
consequence. In 1796 Spain and the  
French Republic formed an alliance, of-  
fensive and defensive; and at that time  
France began a series of negotiations with  
a view to the recovery of her ancient pro-  
vince of Louisiana. This was not effected  
till 1800, under the consulate of Napoleon,  
when, by the treaty of St. Ildefonso,  
Spain retroceded to France the colony o
