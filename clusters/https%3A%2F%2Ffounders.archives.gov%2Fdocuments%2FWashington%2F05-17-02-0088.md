comprehend all the letters I have received from you since your arrival in England, to the present date.  
That of the 5th of August, dawns more favorably upon the success of your mission than any that had preceeded it; and for the honor, dignity and interest of this Country; for your own reputation and glory; and for the peculiar pleasure and satisfaction I should derive from it, as well on private, as on public considerations, no man more ardently wishes you complete success than I do. But as you have observed in some of your letters, that it is hardly possible in the early stages of a negociation to foresee all the results, so much depending upon fortuitous circumstances, and incidents wch are not within our controul; so, to deserve success, by employing the means with which we are possessed, to the best advantage, and trusting the rest to the All wise Disposer; is all that an enlightened public, and the virtuous &amp; well disposed part of the community can reasonably expect—nor in this, will they, I am sure, be disappointed. Against the malignancy of the discontented—the turbulent—and the vicious, no abilities; no exertions; nor the most unshaken integrity are any safeguard.  
As far as depends upon the Executive, measures prepartatory for the worst, while it hopes for the best, will be pursued; and I shall endeavor to keep things in statu quo until your negociation assumes a more decisive form; which I hope will soon be the case, as there are many hot-heads, &amp; impetuous spirits among us, who with difficulty, can be kept within bounds. This, however, ought not to precipitate your conduct; for as it has been observed, there is a “tide in human affairs” which ought to be watched; and because I believe all who are acquainted with you, will readily concede, that considerations both public &amp; private combine, to urge you to bring your mission to a close with as much celerity as the nature of it will admit.  
As you have been, and will continue to be, fully informed by the Secretary of state of all transactions of a public nature, which relates to, or may have an influence on, the points of your mission; it would be unnecessary for me to touch upon any of them, in this letter, was it not for the presumption, that, the insurrection in the western counties of this State has excited much speculation, and a variety of opinions abroad; and will be represented differently according to the wishes of some, and the  
  
prejudices of others; who may exhibit it as an evidence of what has been predicted “that we are unable to govern ourselves.” Under this view of the subject, I am happy in giving it to you as the general opinion, that this event having happened at the time it did, was fortunate, although it will be attended with considerable expence.  
That the self-created Societies, which have spread themselves over this country, have been labouring incessently to sow the seeds of distrust, jealousy, and, of course discontent; thereby hoping to effect some revolution in the government, is not unknown to you. That they have been the fomenters of the western disturbances, admits of no doubt in the mind of any one, who will examine their conduct; but fortunately, they precipitated a crisis for wch they were not prepared; and thereby have unfolded views which will, I trust, effectuate their annihilation sooner than it might otherwise have happened; at the sametime that it has afforded an occasion, for the people of this country, to shew their abhorrence of the result; and their attachment to the Constitution and the laws: for I believe that five times the number of Militia that was required, would have come forward, if it had been necessary, in support of them.  
The spirit which blazed out on this occasion, as soon as the object was fully understood, and the lenient measures of the government were made known to the people, deserve to be communicated: for there are instances of General Officers, going at the head of a single troop, &amp; light companies; of field Officers, when they came to the places of rendezvous &amp; found no command for them in that grade, turning into the ranks, &amp; proceeding as private soldiers, under their own Captains. and of numbers, possessing the first fortunes in the country, standing in the ranks as private men, and marching day by day with their knapsacks &amp; haversacks at their backs; sleeping on straw, with a single blanket in a soldiers tent, during the frosty nights we have had, by way of example to others. nay more of many young Quakers (not discouraged by the Elders) of the first families, characters &amp; properties, having turned into the ranks, and are marching with the Troops.  
These things have terrified the Insurgents, who had no conception that such a spirit prevailed; but while the thunder only rumbled at a distance, were boasting of their strength, and  
  
wishing for, &amp; threatning the militia, by turns; intimating, that the arms they should take from them, would soon become a magazine in their hands. Their language is much changed indeed, but their principles want correction.  
I shall be more prolix in my Speech to Congress on the commencement, &amp; progress of this insurrection than is usual in such an instrument; or than I should have been on any other occasion: but, as numbers (at home and abroad) will hear of the insurrection, and will read the Speech that may know nothing of the documents to which it might refer, I conceived it would be better to encounter the charge of prolixity, by giving a cursory detail of facts (that would shew the prominent features of the thing) than to let it go naked into the world, to be dressed up according to the fancy, or inclination of the readers, or the policy of our enemies.

correspondence, and we shall therefore present to them the greater  
part of a letter from general Washington to Mr. Jay, of the first of  
November, 1794:  
  
“That of the 5th of August dawns more favourably upon the success of your  
mission than any that had preceded it, and for the honour, dignity, and in-  
terest of this country; for your own reputation and glory; and for the pecu-

But, as you have observed in some of your letters, that it is hardly possible  
in the early stages of a negotiation to foresee all the results, so much depend-  
ing upon fortuitous circumstances, and incidents which are not within our  
control,—so to deserve success, by employing the means with which we are  
possessed to the best advantage, and trusting the event to the all-wise Dis-  
poser, is all that an enlightened public, and the virtuous and well-disposed  
part of the community can reasonably expect; nor in this, will they, I am  
sure, be disappointed. Against the malignancy of the discontented, the  
turbulent, and the vicious, no abilities, no exertions, nor the most unshaken  
integrity are any safeguard.  
  
‘“‘ As far as depends upon the executive, measures preparatory for the worst,  
while it hopes for the best, will be pursued; and I shall endeavour to keep  
things in statu quo, until your negotiation assumes a more decisive form, which  
I hope will soon be the case, as there are many hot heads and impetuous spirits  
among us, who with difficulty can be kept within bounds. This, however,  
ought not to precipitate your conduct; for, as it has been observed, ‘ there is  
a tide in human affairs,’ which ought to be watched; and because I believe  
all who are acquainted with you will readily concede, that considerations both  
public and private combine to urge you to bring your mission to a close, with  
as much celerity as the nature of it will admit.

‘¢ As you have been, and will continue to be, fully informed by the secretary  
of state of all transactions of a public nature, which relate to or may have an  
influence on the points of your mission, it would be unnecessary for me to  
touch upon any of them in this letter, was it not for the presumption that the  
insurrection in the western counties of this state has excited much te

offensive part against the administration. They  
assumed that a the people&quot; had the right to he

socicties were attacked in various ways, from the

proach, and sometimes by satire. They gradu-

spread themselves over this country have been lae­  
boring incessantly to sow the seeds of distrust.  
jealousy, and of course discontent, hoping thereby  
to effeet some revolution in the Government, is  
not unknown to you. That they have been the  
promoters of the Western disturbances admits of  
no doubt in the mind of any one who will ex  
amine their conduct. But fortunately they have  
precipitated a crisis for which they were not pre  
pared; and thereby have unfolded views which  
will. I trust, effect their annihilation sooner than  
it might have happened. An occasion has also  
been afforded for the people of this country to  
show their abhorrence of the result, and their  
attachment to the Constitution and the laws; for  
I believe, that five times the number of militia  
that were required, would have come forward in  
support of them, had it been necessary.  
&quot;These things have terrified the insurgents.  
who had no conception that such a spirit pre-­  
vailed, but while the thunder only rumbled at a  
distance, were boasting of their strength, and  
wishing for, and threatening the militia by turns  
intimating that the arms they should take from  
their invaders would soon become a magazine in  
ther hands. Their language is indeed much  
changed, but their prractples still want core­  
rection.&quot;

officers, when they came to a place of rendez­

grade, turning into the ranks and proceeding

and of numbers, possessing the first fortunes

sacks and haversacks at their backs, sleeping  
on straw, with a single blanket, in a soldier&#x27;s
