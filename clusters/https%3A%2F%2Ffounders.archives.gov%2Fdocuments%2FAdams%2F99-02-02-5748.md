d upon my return that nothing had been done and nothing would be done but signing over again in the form of a definitive treaty, the preliminary articles.The character of Dr. Franklin has been an object of the attention and admiration of mankind for so many years, that every thing from his pen will be long considered as a curiosity, and well received: for which reason I shall insert some papers and letters of his, which he prepared, I presume, without any hope of success at present; and which it is to be feared, will be long considered by mankind as too platonic and eutopian to be practicable. One of them follows:It is for the interest of humanity in general, that the occasions of war and the inducements to it, should be diminished. If rapine be abolished, one of the encouragements to war is taken away, and peace, therefore, more likely to continue and be lasting.The practice of robbing merchants on the high seas, a remnant of the ancient piracy, though it may be accidentally beneficial to particular persons, is far from being profitable to all engaged in it, or to the nation that authorises it. In the beginning of a war some rich ships not upon their guard are surprised and taken. This encourages the first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels, and many others to do the same. But the enemy at the same time become more careful, arm their merchant ships better, and render them not so easy to be taken. They go also more under the protection of convoys. Thus while the privateers to take them are multiplied, the vessels subjected to be taken, and the chances of profit, are diminished; so that many cruises are made, wherein the expenses overgo the gains; and as is the case in other lotteries, though particulars have got prizes, the mass of adventurers are losers; the whole expense of fitting out all the privateers during a war being much greater than the whole amount of goods taken.  
  
Then there is the national loss of all the labor of so many men, during the time they have been employed in robbing; who besides spend what they get in riot, drunkenness, and debauchery, lose their habits of industry, are rarely fit for any sober business after a peace, and serve only to increase the number of highwaymen and house breakers; even the undertakers who have been fortunate, are by sudden wealth led into expensive living, the habit of which continues, when the means of supporting it cease, and finally ruin them; a just punishment for their having wantonly and unfeelingly ruined many honest innocent traders, and their families, whose subsistance was employed in serving the common interest of mankind.

answer, but which unfertunately have no  
prac-tical power against the temporary  
advantage found in privateers, by which  
nations are enabled to raise a force  
without taxation, and to divert, it they  
cannot effectually meet, the war ships  
of the enemy. The following are the  
words of FRANKLIN addressed to Mr.  
OSWALD, the British Minister, in the  
negotiations for the peace of 1783 : &quot;  
It is for the interest of humanity in  
general that the occasions of war and  
the inducements to it should be  
diminished. If rapine is abo-lished, one  
of the encouragements of war is taken  
away, and peace, therefore, more likely  
to continue and be lasting. The practice  
of robbing merchants on the high seas-a  
remnant of the ancient piracy-though it  
may be acci-dentally beneficial to  
particular persons, is far from being  
profitable to all engaged in it, or to  
tho nation that authorises it. In the  
beginning of a war, some rich skips, not  
upon their guard, are surprised and  
taken. This encourages the first  
adventurers to fit out more armed  
vessels, and many others to do the same.  
But the enemy, at the samo time, becomes  
more careful -arm their merchant ships  
better, and render them not so easy to  
be taken ; they go also more under the  
protection of convoys. Thus, while the  
privateers to take them are multiplied,  
the vessels subject to be taken and the  
chances of profit are diminished, so  
that many cruizes are made, wherein the  
expenses overg&gt; the gains, and, as is  
the case in other lotteries, though some  
have good prizes, the mass of  
adventurers are losers; the whole  
expense of fitting out all
