	We hear from Amboy, that all the Persons concern’d with Eanon (the same that dy’d at Sea in his Passage from Dublin to this Place) in counterfeiting the 18d. Bills of New Jersey, are apprehended and secur’d in their Prison. It is not found that any other of the New Bills are counterfeited but those of 18d. And it is remarkable that all Attempts of this Kind upon the Paper Money of this and the neighbouring Provinces, have been detected and met with ill Success.

	  We are inform’d that the following Accident lately happen’d at Merion, viz. A Man had order’d his Servant to take some Fowls in from Roost every Night for fear of the Fox: But one Evening hearing them cry, he look’d out and saw, as he thought, a Fox among them; accordingly he took his Gun, charg’d with Swan Shot, and fir’d at him; when to his Surprize it prov’d to be the Servant’s Arm, which taking down the Fowls he had mistaken for a Fox. The Man receiv’d several Shot, some thro’ his Arm, but none of them are thought to be dangerous. [November 6]  
  
  
  
[Advertisement] Whereas William Bradford, of New-York, Printer, has basely and villanously forged an Almanack in my Name, which is not only a considerable Damage to me and my Printer, but also an Imposition upon the Publick: I hereby declare the said Almanack is a base and scandalous Counterfeit, printed without my Consent or Knowledge; and earnestly request all that use to buy Almanacks for the Sake of mine or my Father’s Calculations to discourage such a detestable Piece of Villany: And they may be assur’d I will take the most proper Methods to prosecute the said Bradford, in Order to hinder such Male-Practices for the future. As Witness my Hand,

[Advertisement] Whereas Titan Leeds has been pleased to send forth a scandalous Advertisement against William Bradford, saying, He has forged an Almanack in my (Titan Leeds) Name, which is a Damage to me, and an Imposition upon the Publick,
