refore that it is happy for us to have throughout the Union the same Ideas of a Mile and an Inch a Hogshead and a Quart, a Pound an Ounce. So far our commercial Dealings are simplified and brought down to the level of every Capacity. With respect to our Money the Case is very widely different. The Ideas annexed to a Pound a Shilling and a Penny are almost as various as the States themselves. Calculations are therefore as necessary for our inland Commerce as upon foreign Exchanges and the commonest Things become intricate where Money has any thing to do with them. A Farmer in New hampshire for Instance can readily form an Idea of a Bushell of Wheat in South Carolina weighing sixty Pounds and placed at one hundred Miles from Charlestown but if he were told that in such Situation it is worth twenty one Shillings and eight Pence, he would be obliged to make many Enquiries and form some Calculations before he could know that this Sum meant in general what he would call four Shillings. And even then he would have to enquire what Kind of Coin that four Shillings was paid in before he could estimate it in his own Mind according to the Ideas of Money which he had imbibed. Difficulties of this Sort do not occur to Farmers alone, they are perplexing to most Men and troublesome to all. It is however a fortunate Circumstance that Money is so much in the Power of the Sovereign as t

 off the Inconveniencies of a depreciating Medium the present Moment seems to be that in which a general Currency can best be established so as that in a few Months the same Names of Money will mean the same Things in the several Parts of the United States.  
Another Inconvenience which admits of the same easy Remedy and which would indeed be cured by the very same Act is the Want of a legal Tender. This is as necessary for the Purposes of Jurisprudence as a general Currency is for those of Commerce.

It must however be remembered that they are all foreign Coins and of Course we are not only exposed to the Tricks of Individuals but should it suit the Interest or Convenience of any Sovereign to make base Money for us there is Nothing to prevent it. If for Instance the King of England or any of his Birmingham Artists should coin Guineas worth but sixteen shillings Sterling our Citizens would readily and freely receive them at twenty one Shillings Sterling. It is my Duty to mention to Congress Information I have received that Guineas of base Metal are coined  at Birmingham so well as to escape any common Attention. Now there can be no Doubt but that every such Guinea received here would be a national Loss to us of an English Crown

Arguments are unnecessary to shew that the Scale by which every thing is to be measured ought to be as fixed as the Nature of Things will permit of. Since therefore a Money Standard affixed to both the precious Metals will not give this certain Scale it is better to make use of one only. Gold is more valuable than Silver and so far must have the Preference but it is from that very Circumstance the more exposed to fraudulent Practices.

ded.  
In Order that a Coin may be perfectly intelligible to the whole People it must have some Affinity to the former Currency. This therefore will be requisite in the present Case. The Purposes of Commerce require that the lowest divisible Point of Money or what is more properly called the Money Unit should be very small because by that Means Price can be brought in the smallest Things to bear a Proportion to the Value. And altho it is not absolutely necessary yet it is very desirable that Money should be increased in a decimal Ratio because by that Means all Calculations of Interest Exchange Insurance and the like are rendered much more simple and accurate and of Course more within the Power of the great Mass of People. Wherever such Things require much Labor Time and Reflection the greater Number who do not know are made the  Dupes of the lesser Number who do.  
The various Coins which have circulated in America have undergone different Changes in their Value so that there is hardly any  which can be considered as a general Standard unless it be spanish Dollars. These pass in Georgia at five Shillings in North Carolina and New York at eight Shillings in Virginia and the four Eastern states at six Shillings in all the other States except South Carolina at seven Shillings and six Pence and in South Carolina at thirty two Shillings and six Pence: The Money Unit of a new Coin to agree without a Fraction with all these different Values of a Dollar except the last will be the fourteen hundred and fortieth Part of a Dollar equal to the sixteen hundreth Part of a Crown. Of these Units twenty four will be a Penny of Georgia, fifteen will be a  Penny of North Carolina, or New York, twenty will be a Penny of Virginia and the four Eastern States sixteen will be a Penny of all the other States except South Carolina and forty eight will be thirteen Pence of South Carolina.  
It has been already observed that to have the Money Unit very small is advantageous to Commerce but there is no Necessity that this Money Unit be exactly represented in Coin it is sufficient that its Value be precisely known. On the present Occasion two Copper Coins will be proper the one of eight Units and the other of five. These may be called an eight and a five two of the former will make a Penny Proclamation or Pennsylvania Money and three a Penny Georgia Money, of the latter three will make a Penny York Money and four a Penny lawful or Virginia Money. The Money Unit will be equal to a quarter of a Grain of fine Silver in coined Money. Proceeding thence in a decimal Ratio one hundred would be the lowest Silver Coin and might be called a Cent. It would contain twenty five Grains of fine Silver to which may be added two Grains of Copper and the whole would weigh one Penny Weight three Grains. Five of these would make a Quint or five hundred Units weighing five Penny Weight fifteen Grains and ten would make a Mark or one thousand Units weighing Seven Penny weight six Grains.

 should be left entirely to the Operations of Commerce as Bullion. In the present Moment it is by no Means of such Consequence to establish the relative Value of different Coins as to provide a Standard of our own by which in future to estimate them.

cabinets. But as soon as the Americans had won their freedom, the  
want of a uniform and national currency began to be felt, and Congress  
called upon the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Morris, to prepare a  
report of the foreign coins circulating in the country. The report was  
drawn up by the assistant financier Gouverneur Morris, who at the same  
time presented a system of American coinage. Mr. Morris remarks :  
  
The various coins which have circulated in America, have undergone different  
ehanges in value, so that there is hardly any which can be considered as a general  
standard, unless it be Spanish dollars. These pass in Georgia, at 5s.; in North Caro-  
lina and New York, at 8s.; in Virginia and the four Eastern States, 6s.; in South  
Carolina, at 32s. 5d.; in all the other states, at 7s. 6d. The money unit of a new  
coin, to agree without a fraction, with all these different values of a dollar, excepting  
the last, will be the fourteen hundred and fortieth part of a dollar. Of these units,  
twenty-four will be a penny of Georgia, fifteen a penny of North Carolina or New

al kinds of money then current, were almost as various as the  
states themselves. Calculations were as necessary for inland, as  
for foreign commerce. The commonest transactions grew intricate  
when money entered into them. “A farmer in New Hampshire,

Carolina, weighing sixty pounds, and placed at one hundred miles

from Charleston; but, if he were told that in such situation it is  
worth twenty-one shillings and eight pence, he would be obliged  
to make many inquiries, and form some calculations before he  
could know that this sum meant in general what he would call four  
shillings; and even then he would have to inquire what kind of  
coin that four shillings was paid in, before he could estimate it in  
his own mind, according to the ideas of money, which he had im-  
bibed.”” Surely, there was need for establishing a uniform cur-  
rency, when such money was in use. The need was not less press-  
ing for providing money which could be employed as a just legal  
tender.  
  
The reasons for using both gold and silver were next considered.

people. In order to coin money which should be perfectly intel-  
ligible to the whole people, it was necessary to preserve an affinity  
to their former currency. “The purposes of commerce require  
that the lowest divisible point of money, or what is more properly  
called the money unit, should be very small, because by that means  
prices can be brought in the smallest things to bear a proportion to  
their value. And although it is not absolutely, yet it is very desir-  
able that money should be increased in decimal ratio, because by  
that means all calculations of interest, exchange, insurance, and  
the like, are rendered much more simple and accurate, and, of  
course, more within the power of the great mass of the people ;”  
to which he added the very truthful observation, « Whenever such  
things require much labor, time, and reflection, the greater number  
who do not know are made the dupes of the smaller number who  
do.”  
  
The values of all coins circulating in America, from time to  
time, had changed, and now, when Morris was considering the  
subject of coinage, there was no general standard, unless it was the  
Spanish dollar. It passed in Georgia at five shillings, in North  
Carolina and New York at eight shillings, in Virginia and the four  
Eastern states at six shillings, and in all the other states except  
South Carolina, at seven shillings and six pence, and in South  
Carolina at thirty-two shillings and six pence. The money unit  
of a new coin which should agree, without a fraction, with all these  
different values of a dollar, except the last, would be the fourteen

hundred and fortieth part of a dollar. Of these units, twenty-four  
would be equal to a penny of Georgia, fifteen a penny of North  
Carolina and New York, twenty a penny of Virginia and the four  
Eastern states, sixteen a penny of all the other states except South  
Carolina, where thirteen pence would be equal to forty-eight of the  
proposed coinage.  
  
Morris observed that it was not necessary to represent the  
money unit by a coin; it would be sufficient to ascertain its pre-  
cise value. “On the present occasion, two copper coins will be  
proper, the one of eight units and the other of five. These may  
be called an Eight anda Five. Two of the former will make a  
penny Proclamation, or Pennsylvania money, and three a penny  
Georgia money. Of the latter, three will makea penny New York  
money, and four a penny lawful, or Virginia money. The money  
unit will be equal to a quarter of a grain of fine silver in coined  
money. Proceeding thence, in a decimal ratio, one hundred would  
be the lowest silver coin, and might be called a Cent. It would  
contain twenty-five grains of fine silver, to which may be added  
two grains of copper, and the whole would weigh one pennyweight  
and three grains. Five of these would make a Quint, or five hun-
