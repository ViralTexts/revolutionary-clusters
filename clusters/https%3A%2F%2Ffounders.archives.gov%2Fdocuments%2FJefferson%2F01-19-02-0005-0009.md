Dear Sir  
Philadelphia Feb. 19. 1791.  
  
I feel both the wish and the duty to communicate, in compliance with your request, whatever, within my knowledge, might render justice to the memory of our great countryman Dr. Franklin, in whom Philosophy has to deplore one of it’s principal luminaries extinguished. But my opportunities of knowing the interesting facts of his life have not been equal to my desire of making them known. I could indeed relate a number of those bons mots, with which he was used to charm every society, as having heard many of them. But these are not your object. Particulars of greater dignity happened not to occur during his stay of nine months after my arrival in France.  
A little before that, Argand had invented his celebrated lamp, in which the flame is spread into a hollow cylinder, and thus brought into contact with the air within as well as without. Doctr. Franklin had been on the point of the same discovery. The idea had occurred to him; but he had tried a bull-rush as a wick, which did not succeed. His occupations did not permit him to repeat and extend his trials to the introduction of a larger column of air than could pass through the stem of a bull-rush.  
The Animal magnetism too of the Maniac, Mesmer, had just recieved it’s death’s wound from his hand in conjunction with his brethren of the learned committee appointed to unveil that compound of fraud and folly. But after this, nothing very interesting was before the public, either in philosophy or politicks, during his stay: and he was principally occupied in winding up his affairs there.  
I can only therefore testify in general that there appeared to me more respect and veneration attached to the character of Doctor Franklin in France than to that of any other person in the same country, foreign or native. I had opportunities of knowing particularly how far these sentiments were felt by the foreign Ambassadors and ministers at the court of Versailles. The fable of his capture by the Algerines, propagated by the English news-papers,  excited no uneasiness; as it was seen at once to be a dish cooked up to the palate of their readers. But nothing could exceed the anxiety of his diplomatic brethren, on a subsequent report of his death, which, tho’ premature, bore some marks of authenticity.  
I found the ministers of France equally impressed with the talents and integrity of Doctr. Franklin. The Ct. de Vergennes particularly gave me repeated and unequivocal demonstrations of his entire confidence in him.  
When he left Passy, it seemed as if the village had lost it’s Patriarch. On taking leave of the court, which he did by letter, the king ordered him to be handsomely complimented, and furnished him with a litter and mules of his own, the only kind of conveyance the state of his health could bear.  
No greater proof of his estimation in France can be given than the late letters of condoleance on his death from the National assembly of that country, and the community of Paris, to the President of the U.S. and to Congress, and their public mourning on that event. It is I believe the first instance of that homage having been paid by a public body of one nation to a private citizen of another.  
His death was an affliction which was to happen to us at some time or other. We had reason to be thankful he was so long spared: that the most useful life should be the longest also: that it was protracted so far beyond the ordinary span allotted to man, as to avail us of his wisdom in the establishment of our own freedom, and to bless him with a view of it’s dawn in the east, where they seemed till now to have learned every thing, but how to be free.  
The succession to Dr. Franklin at the court of France, was an excellent school of humility. On being presented to any one as the Minister of America, the common-place question, used in such cases, was ‘c’est vous, Monsieur, qui remplace le Docteur Franklin?’ ‘It is you, Sir, who replace Doctor Franklin?’ I generally answered ‘no one can replace him, Sir; I am only his successor.’  
These small offerings to the memory of our great and dear friend, whom time will be making greater while it is spunging us from it’s records, must be accepted by you, Sir, in that spirit of love and veneration for him in which they are made: and not according to their insignificance in the eyes of a world, who did not want this mite to fill up the measure of his worth.—I pray you to accept in addition assurances of the sincere

merican Philosophical Society, at Philadelphia :  
“ 1 feel,” (ays this gentleman, “ both the will)  
and the duty to communicate, in compliance  
with your requeft, whatever, within my know­  
ledge, might render juftice to the memory of  
our great countryman, Dr. Franklin, in whom  
Philofophy has to deplore one of irs principal lu- j  
minaries extinguilhed. Rut my opportunities  
of knowing ihe iuterefline fa«S8 of his life have  
not been equal to uiy delire of making them  
known.  
“ I can only, therefore, t.fiifv in general, that  
there appeared to me more rripret an,| venera­  
tion attached to the ebaratfter of I)r. Franklin,  
in Frn nee, than to that of any other perfon in the  
fame country, foreign or native. I |,;,d upper-1  
tunitics of knowing particularly Ik,w f.,r rti«-(k&gt;1  
fentimento were felt, by the foreign Ambolfadors  
and Mini/?ers, at the Court of Verfdlles^ &#x27;Flic  
fahle of his capture by the Algerines, propagat­  
ed by the Englifh news-papers, excited no mu  
(.afinefs,as it was A*en «rt once to Ire a tlilli cook­  
ed up to pleafe certain readers, hut nothing  
could exceed the anxiety of his diplomatic bre­  
thr-n, on a fubfequent report of his death, which  
a though premature bore foine marks of authen­  
ticity.  
1 found the mini Hers of France equally im­  
prelied with bis talents and integrity. The  
Count de Vcrgcnr.cs, particularly, gave me re­  
peated unequivocal den . : .’V&lt;;ioi.s of his entire  
confide nee in him.  
, ** •*c u fi ■ n-;, ii teemed as if the vil­  
had loft its Pat, i, On taki;.g leave of  
me Count, which he did by letter, the king or­  
t.ered him to be Jiandfomely complimented, and  
rurmftied him with a litter and mules of his own,  
the only kind of conveyance the ftate cf his  
health could bear. ,  
“The fucccflion of Dr. Franklin, at the court 1  
of France, was an excellent felipnl of humility i  
to me. On being prefented to any one, as the  
Mwifler of America, the common place queftion I  
was “c’c ftvous, monficur, qni rempleo»z |c  
DoSeur Franklin ?” Is it you, Sir, who replace  
Dotftor Franklin &gt; I generally anfwered—“ No  
one can replace him, Sir, I am only his/hr.[for.&quot;  
I could there relate a nnmhcr of thofc bans  
“ mote, with which lie wasufed to charm every fo­  
ciety, as having heard many of them ; but thefc  
are not your obje.fl. Particulars of greater dig­  
nity happened not to occur, during his ftay of  
nine months after my arrival in France.  
“ A little before that time, Argo,id had inven­  
ted his celebrated lamp, in which the flame is  
fpread into a hollow cylinder, and thus brought  
into contact with the air, within as well as with­  
out. Dr. Franklin had been on the point of the  
fame difeovery. The idea had occurred to him;  
but he had tried a bull rufii as a wick, which did  
not fuccced. His occupations did not permit  
him to repeat and extend his trials to the intro­  
duction of a larger column of air, than could  
pafs through the ftem of a bull riifh.  
About that time, alio, the King of France  
gave him a fignal teftimony of rcfpe.fl, by join­  
ing him with fume of the mod illuftrious men !  
of the nation, to examine that ignis fat,,us of!  
philofophy, the animal mavnetifm of the maniac,!  
Mcfmer ; the pretended efiluts of which had af- !  
tomfhed all Paris. By Dr. Franklin’s hand, in i  
conjunction with his brethren of the learned  
committee, that compound of fraud and folly !  
was unveiled, and received its death-wound._  
After this, nothing very intuelting was before  
the public, either in philofophy or politics, dur­  
ing his ftay ; and he was principally occupied  
in winding up his affairs, and preparing for his  
return to America.  
“ Thefe fmall offerings to the memory of our  
great and dear friend,(whom time will be mak­  
ing ftiil greater, while it is fpunging ns from its I  
records) mult be accepted by you, Sir, in that

they arc made ; and not according to their jn­  
fignificanry in the eyes of a world, which did

“ His death was an affliction, which was to  
happen to us at fome time or other. We have  
re fra to be thankful he was fo long fpared ; j  
that themoft ufeful life fhould he the longcft al­
