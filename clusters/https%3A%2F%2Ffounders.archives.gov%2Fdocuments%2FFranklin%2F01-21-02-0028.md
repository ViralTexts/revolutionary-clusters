ithstanding the intimations I had received, I could not believe that the solicitor-general would be permitted to wander from the question before their lordships, into a new case, the accusation of another person for another matter, not cognizable before them, who could not expect to be there so accused, and therefore could not be prepared for his defence. And yet all this happened, and in all probability was preconcerted; for all the courtiers were invited as to an entertainment, and there never was such an appearance of privy counsellors on any occasion, not less than thirty-five, besides an immense crowd of other auditors.  
The hearing began by reading my letter to Lord Dartmouth, enclosing the petition, then the petition itself, the resolves, and lastly the letters, the solicitor-general making no objections, nor asking any of the questions he had talked of at the preceding board. Our counsel then opened the matter, upon their general plan, and acquitted themselves very handsomely; only Mr. Dunning, having a disorder on his lungs that weakened his voice exceedingly, was not so perfectly heard as one could have wished. The solicitor-general then went into what he called a history of the province for the last ten years, and bestowed plenty of abuse upon it, mingled with encomium on the governours: But the favourite part of his discourse was levelled at your agent, who stood there the butt of his invective and ribaldry for near an hour, not a single lord adverting to the impropriety and indecency of treating a publick messenger in so ignominious a manner, who was present only as the person delivering your petition, with the consideration of which no part of his conduct had any concern. If he had done a wrong, in obtaining and transmitting the letters, that was not the tribunal where he was to be accused and tried: The cause was already before the chancellor. Not one of their lordships checked and recalled the orator to the business before them, but on the contrary (a very few excepted) they seemed to enjoy highly the entertainment, and frequently burst out in loud applauses. This part of his speech was thought so good, that they have since printed it in order to defame me every where, and particularly to destroy my reputation on your side the water, but the grosser parts of the abuse are omitted, appearing, I suppose in their own eyes, too foul to be seen on paper; so that the speech, compared to what it was, is now perfectly decent.

.  
Their lordships’ report, which I send you, is dated the same day. It contains a severe censure, as you will see, on the petition and the petitioners; and, as I think, a very unfair conclusion from my silence, that the charge of surreptitiously obtaining the letters was a true one; though the solicitor, as appears in the printed speech, had acquainted them that that matter was before the chancellor; and my counsel had stated the impropriety of my answering there, to charges then trying in another court. In truth I came by them honourably, and my intention in sending them was virtuous, if an endeavour to lessen the breach between two states of the same empire be such, by showing that the injuries complained of by one of them did not proceed from the other, but from traitors among themselves.  
It may be supposed that I am very angry on this occasion, and therefore I did purpose to add no reflections of mine on the treatment the assembly and their agent have received, lest they should be thought the effects of resentment and a desire of exasperating. But indeed what I feel on my own account is half lost in what I feel for the publick. When I see that all petitions and complaints of grievances are so odious to government, that even the mere pipe which conveys them becomes obnoxious, I am at a loss to know how peace and union is to be maintained or restored between the different parts of the empire. Grievances cannot be redressed unless they are known; and they cannot be known but through complaints and petitions: If these are deemed affronts, and the messengers punished as offenders, who will henceforth send petitions? and who will deliver them? It has been thought a dangerous thing in any state to stop up the vent of griefs. Wise governments have therefore generally received petitions with some indulgence, even when but slightly founded. Those who think themselves injured by their rulers, are sometimes, by a mild and prudent answer, convinced of their errour. But where complaining is a crime, hope becomes despair.  
The day following I received a written notice from the secretary of the general post-office, that his majesty’s post-master general found it necessary to dismiss me from my office of deputy postmaster general in North America. The expression was well chosen, for in truth they were under a necessity of doing it; it was not their own inclination; they had no fault to find with my conduct in the office; they knew my merit in it, and that if it was now an office of value, it had become such chiefly through my care and good management; that it was worth nothing, when given to me; it would not then pay the salary allowed me, and unless it did, I was not to expect it; and that it now produces near £3000 a year clear to the treasury here: They had beside a personal regard for me. But as the post-offices in all the principal towns are growing daily more and more valuable by the increase of correspondence (the officers being paid commissions instead of salaries) the ministers seem to intend by directing me to be displaced on this occasion, to hold out to them all an example, that if they are not corrupted by their office to promote the measures of administration, though against the interest and rights of the colonies, they must not expect to be continued. This is the first act for extending the influence of government in this branch: But as orders have been some time since given to the American post-master general, who used to have the disposition of all places under them, not to fill vacancies of value, till notice of such vacancies had been sent hither, and instructions thereupon received from hence, it is plain that such influence is to be a part of the system, and probable that those vacancies will for the future be filled by officers from this country. How safe the correspondence of your Assembly-committees along the continent will be through the hands of such officers, may now be worth consideration, especially as the postoffice act of parliament, allows a post-master to open letters, if warranted so to do by the order of a secretary of state, and every provincial secretary may be deemed a secretary of state in his own province.  
It is not yet known what steps will be taken by government with regard to the colonies, or to our province in particular. But as inquiries are making of all who come from thence, concerning the late riot, and the meetings that preceded it, and who were speakers and movers at those meetings, &amp;c. I suspect there is some intention of seizing persons, and perhaps of sending them hither.

Solicitor-General would be permitted to  
wander from the question before their  
lordships into a new case, the accusation  
of another person for another matter, not

governors. But the favorite part of his  
discourse was levelled at your agent, who  
stood there the butt of his invective ri-  
baldry for near an hour, not a single  
lord adverting to the impropriety and in-  
decency of treating a public messenger in  
so ignominious a manner, who was pre-  
sent only as the person delivering your  
petition, with the consideration of which  
no part of Ais conduct had any concern.  
If he had done a wrong in obtaining and

Wise governments have therefore gener-

“The day following I received a writ-  
ten notice from the secretary of the gen-  
eral post-office, that His Majesty’s Post-  
master-General found it necessary to dis-  
miss me from my office of deputy Postmas-  
ter-General in North America. The ex-  
pression was well chosen, for in truth they  
were under the necessity of doing it; it  
was not their own inclination; they had  
no fault to find with my conduct in the  
office ; they knew my merit in it, and that  
if it was now an office of value, it has be-  
come such chiefly through my care and  
good management; that it was worth  
nothing when given to me; it would not  
then pay the salary allowed me, and un-  
less it did I was not to expect it; and that  
it now produces near £3,000 clear to the  
treasury here. ‘They had, besides, a per-  
sonal regard for me. But as the post-

ing daily more and more valuable by the  
increase of correspondence, the officers be-

sion, to hold out to them all an example,  
that if they are not corrupted by their of-  
fice to promote the measures of Adminis-  
tration, though against the interests and  
rights of the colunies, they must not ex-  
pect to be continued. This is the first act  
for extending the influence of Government  
in this branch. But as orders have been  
some time since given to the American  
Postmaster-General, who used to have the  
disposition of all places under him, not to  
fill vacancies under him till notice of such  
vacancies had been sent thither, and in-  
structions thereupon received from hence,  
it is plain that such influence is to bea  
part of the system, and probable that  
those vacancies will for the future be fill-  
ed by officers from this country. How  
safe the correspondence of your Assembly  
committees along the continent will be  
through the hands of such officers, may  
now be worth consideration, especially as  
the post-office act of Parliament allows a  
postmaster to open letters if warranted so  
to do by order of the Secretary of State ;  
and every provincial secretary may be  
deemed a Secretary of State in his own  
province.”

I received a written notice from the secretary  
of the general post-office, that his Majesty’s post-  
master-general found it necessary to dismiss me  
from my office of deputy postmaster-general in  
North America. The expression was well chosen,  
for in truth they were under a necessity of doing

fault to find with my conduct in the office; they  
knew my merit in it, and that if it was now an  
office of value it had become such chiefly through  
my care and good management; that it was worth  
nothing when given to me; it would not then pay  
the salary allowed me, and unless it did I was not

occasion, to hold out to them all an example, that

the interests and rights of the colonies, they must  
not expect to be continued.
