ld not have produced any alteration in the sentiments of the gentlemen, it will at least soften that hard decision which seems to threaten the friends of the Potowmack. He hoped that all would concur in the great principle on which they ought to conduct, and decide this business: an equal attention to the rights of the community. No government, he said, not even the most despotic, could, beyond a certain point, violate that idea of justice, and equal right, which prevailed in the mind of the community. In republican governments, justice and equality form the basis of the system; and perhaps the structure can rest on no other that the wisdom of man can devise. In a federal republic, give me leave to say, it is even more nec

st upon equitable demands. In a confederacy of states, in which the people operate, in one respect as citizens, and in another as forming political communities, the local governments will ever possess a keener sense and capacity, to take advantages of those powers, on which the protection of local rights depend. If these great rights be the basis of republics, and if there be a double necessity of attending to them in a federal republic, it is further to be considered, that there is no one right, of which the people can judge with more ease and certainty, and of which they will judge with more jealousy, than of the establishment of the permanent seat of government; and I am persuaded, that however often this subject may be discussed in the representative body, or however the attention of the committee may be drawn to it, the observations I have made will be more and more verified. We see the operation of this sentiment fully exemplified in what has taken place in the several states. In every instance where, the seat of g

e been made, and in all probability, when some temporary considerations cease, we shall find the same principle taking effect there also. It is not surprising, when we consider the nature of mankind, that this should be the case.  
With respect, however, to the federal government, there is one consideration that shews, in a peculiar manner, the necessity and policy of paying a strict attention to this principle. One of the greatest objections, which have been made by the opponents of the system; which has been allowed most weight by its friends, is the extent of the United States. It has been asserted by some, and almost feared by others, that within so great a space, no free government can exist. I hope and trust, that the opinion is erroneous; but at the same time, I acknowledge it to have such a certain degree of force, that it is incumbent on those who wish well to the union, to diminish this inconvenience as much as possible. The way to diminish it, is to place the government in that spot which will be least removed from every part of the empire. Carry it to an eccentric position, and it will be equivalent to an extension of our limits. And if our limits are already extended so far as warrants, in any degree, the apprehension before mentioned, we ought to take care not to extend them farther.  
The truth is, in every point of view in which we can contemplate this subject, we shall perceive its high importance. It is important, that every part of the community should have the power of sending, with equal facility, to the seat of government such representatives to take care of their interests, as they are disposed to confide in. If you place the government in an eccentric situation, the attendance of the members, and of all others who are to transact the public business, cannot be equally convenient. The members of the union, must be on an unequal footing. Thus you violate the principle of equality, where it ought most carefully to be ascertained, and wound the feelings of the component parts of the community, which can be least injured with impunity. If we consider the expence, that is an inconvenience not without its weight. In the compensations that have been lately voted, the eccentricity of our position has had a manifest influence. The more remote the government is, the greater will be the necessity of making liberal compensations, and holding out powerful inducements, in order to obtain the services of fit characters, from every part of the union; and as you can make no distinction, you must give to those who make the fewest sacrifices, the same as to those who make the most.  
The seat of government is of great importance; if you consider the diffusion of wealth, that proceeds from this source. I presume that the expenditures which will take place, where the government will be established, by them who are immediately concerned in its administration, and by others who may resort to it, will not be less than a half a million of dollars a year. It is to be regretted, that those who may be most convenient to the centre, should enjoy this advantage in a higher degree than others; but the inequality is an evil imposed by necessity; we diminish it as we place the source from which those emanations of wealth are to proceed, as near the centre as possible.  
If we consider, sir, the effects of legislative power on the aggregate community, we must feel equal inducements to look for the centre, in order to find the proper seat of government. Those who are most adjacent to the seat of legislation, will always possess advantages over others. An earlier knowledge of the laws; a greater influence in enacting them; better opportunities for anticipating them, and a thousand other circumstances, will give a superiority to those who are thus situated. If it were possible to promulge our laws, by some instantaneous operation, it would be of less consequence in that point of view where the government might be placed; but if, on the contrary, time is necessary for this purpose, we ought, as far as possible, to put every part of the community on a level.  
If we consider the influence of the government in its executive department, there is no less reason to conclude, that it ought to be placed in the centre of the union. It ought to be in a situation to command information relative to every part of the union, to watch every conjuncture, to seize every circumstance that can be improved. The executive eye ought to be placed where it can best see the dangers which may threaten, and the executive arm, whence it may be extended most effectually to the protection of every part. Perhaps it is peculiarly necessary, that in looking for this position, we should keep our eye as much as possible towards our western borders; for a long time dangers will be most apt to assail that quarter of the union.  
In the judiciary department, if it is not equally necessary, it is highly important that the government should be equally accessible to all.  
Why should the citizens of one quarter of the union be subject to greater difficulties than others? Why should they be obliged to travel farther, to carry their witnesses at a greater expence, and be more subject to all the inconveniencies attending the administration of justice at a remote distance? In short, whether we consider the subject with regard to the executive, the legislative, or the judicial departments, we see the soundest reasons for fixing the government in that place, which may be the most permanent centre of territory and population.  
With respect to the Western Territory, we are not to expect it, for it would be an affront to the understanding of our fellow citizens on the western waters, that they will be united with their Atlantic brethren, on any other principle than that of equality and justice. He would venture to say, that it was essentially necessary, therefore, that we should deal out the blessings of government with an impartial hand; and that, in placing the government from which these blessings are to flow, we should retire from the Atlantic as far as is consistent, and approach towards that point which will best accommodate the western country; in doing this, we shall still stop short of that geographical centre, whose circle would

s only west, it will still be 500 miles from the Mississippi.  
He was sure, that if justice required us to take any one position in preference to another, we had every inducement, both of interest and of prudence, to fix on the Potowmack, as most satisfactory to our western brethren. It is impossible to reflect a moment on the possible severance of that branch of the union, without seeing the mischiefs which such an event must create. The area of the United States, divided into two equal parts, will leave, perhaps, one half on the west side of the Allegany mountains: From the fertility of soil, the fineness of climate, and every thing that can favor a growing population, we may suppose the settlement will go on with every degree of rapidity which our imagination can conceive. If the calculation be just, that we double in twenty-five years, we shall speedily behold an astonishing mass of people on the western waters. Whether this great mass shall form a permanent part of the confederacy, or whether it shall be separated into an alien, a jealous and a hostile people, may depend on the system of measures that is shortly to be taken. The difference, he observed, between considering them in the light of fellow-citizens, bound to us by a common affection, obeying common laws, pursuing a common good, and considering them in the other light, presents one of the most interesting questions that can occupy an American mind: Instead of peace and friendship, we shall have rivalship and enmity; instead of being a great people, invulnerable on all sides, and without the necessity of those military establishments which other nations require, we shall be driven into the same expensive and dangerous means of defence: We shall be obliged to lay burthens on the people, to support establishments which, sooner or later, may prove fatal to their liberties. It is incumbent on us, he said, if we wished to act the part of magnanimous legislators, or patriotic citizens, to consider well, when we are about to take a step of such vast importance, that it be directed by the views he had described; we must consider what is just, what is equal, and what is satisfactory.  
It may be asked, why it was necessary to urge these principles, since they would not be denied? He apprehended, that in general, there would be a disagreement as to the principles which ought to govern: But, at the same time, principles were so connected with facts, in the present case, that it was not more necessary to collect all the light, than to fortify all the impressions that might be favorable to a just decision.  
On a candid view of the two rivers, he flattered himself, that the seat, which would most correspond with the public interest, would be found on the banks of the Potowmack. It was proper that we should have some regard to the centre of territory; if that was to have weight, he begged leave to say, that there was no comparison between the two rivers. He defied any gentleman to cast his eye, in the most cursory manner, over a map, and say, that the Potowmack is not much nearer this centre than any part of the Susquehanna. If we measure from the banks of the Potowmack to the most eastern parts of the United States, it is less distant than to the most southern. If we measure this great area diagonally, the Potowmack will still have the advantage: If you draw a line perpendicular, to the direction of the Atlantic coast, we shall find that it will run more equally through the Potowmack than through any other part of the union; or, if there be any difference between one side and the other, there will be a greater space on the southwest than on the north-east: All the maps of the United States shew the truth of this. From the Atlantic coast to that line which separates the British possessions from the United States, the average distance is not more than 150 miles: If you take the average breadth of the other great division of the United States, it will be found to be six, seven, and eight hundred miles.  
From this view of the subject, which is not easy to describe by words, but which will strike every eye that looks on a map, I am sure, that if the Potowmack is not the geographical centre, it is because the Susquehanna is less so.  
He acknowledged that regard was also to be paid to the centre of population. But where shall we find this centre? He knew of no rule by which to be governed, except the proportion among the representatives of the different states; and he believed, if that criterion was taken, the present centre of population would be found somewhere in Pennsylvania, and not far from the Susquehanna. He granted that the present centre of population is nearer the Susquehanna than the Potowmack. But are we chusing a seat of government for the present moment only? He presumed not, we must look forward to those probable changes that may soon take place. He appealed to the judgment of every gentleman, if they had not reason to suppose, that these future changes, in the population of this country, would be particularly favorable to that part which lies south of the Potowmack. On what do the measures and extent of population depend? They depend on the climate, on the soil, and the vacancy to be filled. We find that population, like money, seeks those places where it least abounds, and has always the same tendency to equalize itself. We see the people moving from the more crouded to the less crouded parts. The swarms do not come from the southern, but from the northern and eastern hives. This will continue to be the case, until every part of America receives its due share of population. If there be any event, on which we may calculate with certainty, I take it that the centre of population will continually advance in a south-western direction. It must then travel from the Susquehanna; if it is now found there, it may even extend beyond the Potowmack. But the time would be long first, and as the Potowmack is the great highway of communication between the Atlantic and the western country, attempts to remove the seat farther south must be improbable. I have said that the communication with the Western Territory is more commodious through the Potowmack than through the Susquehanna; I wish all the facts connected with this subject could have been more fully ascertained, and more fully stated; but if we consider the facts that have been offered, by gentlemen who have spoken on the subject, we must conclude, that the communication through the Potowmack would be more facile and effectual than through any other channel. If we consider what was related by the gentleman fro

 whereas, through the Potowmack, the distance from the proposed spot on its banks to Fort-Pitt, was not calculated at more than 250 miles, and he believed the distance, by land, would be found not to exceed 160 or 170 miles.  
Whether we measure the distance by land or water, then, the result is in favor of the Potowmack. If we consider the progress already made in opening this great channel, its title becomes still stronger. Let me add, that it has been found, on accurate research, that the waters communicating with the Ohio are not more than two or three miles distant from the sources of the Potowmack. This is a fact of peculiar importance.  
It has been said, that if congress should make choice of the Potowmack, greater discontents would arise than if they should prefer the Susquehanna: I know not the data from which this opinion is drawn. Who will have the greatest right to complain? Will it be those who might be gratified if the government should be fixed on the Susquehannah? I believe not. The truth is, that if the place which is now short of the geographical centre, be short also of the centre of population, as it will be in a reasonable time, we have reason to conclude, that the southern inhabitants will feel themselves most aggrieved. I do not hesitate to declare, that if the seat of government should be fixed on the Susquehanna, every part south of that river, and every part of the United States south of the Ohio, will conceive that the great principles of equal justice have been disregarded. If we are to consider the subject, in that point of view, I am certain it is most expedient that we should give the preference to the Potowmack. This is not all; if you establish the government on the Potowmack, those who think themselves not equally dealt by, will find the cause of their discontent continually subsiding, because the centre of population will be continually approaching to the geographical centre. If, on the other hand, you fix the seat in a place which is perpetually eccentric with respect to territory, the centre of population will continually recede, and cause of discontent continually increase.  
The gentleman from Massachusetts, yesterday, raised great objections against the Potowmack, because it was, as he supposed, subject to periodical maladies, from which the other river was free. I am not authorised, from personal experience, or very particular information, to draw a comparison between them; but there are some general facts that may serve to shew, that if there is any difference, it is more likely to be in favor of the Potowmack than of the Susquehanna. The position contemplated on the banks of the former, is considerably farther from tide-water than the place pr

oposed on the latter. On this account, therefore, we have little reason to suppose that the Potowmack is more unhealthy. If we regard their comparative situation, westwardly, the spot on the Potowmack is almost as much farther to the west, as it is distant from the proposed spot on the Susquehanna; and he well knew that, generally speaking, as we retire towards the western and upper country, we are generally removed from the causes of those diseases to which southern situations are exposed. As the two places are moreover in the same latitude, the objection advanced, with respect to that point, cannot apply to one more than the other. It is only their western or eastern position, their remoteness from, or their proximity to the lower country, and to fresh or stagnated waters, that can possibly affect the question. It is not because we advance so much to the south that we advance to the centre, it is because we go more to the west. I do not know that there is a difference of more than a degree and five or six minutes between the latitude of New-York and the place proposed on the Potowmack.  
I will not at present go farther into this argument. I flatter myself, that the considerations already stated, will have their proper weight; and if they should be controverted, that we shall be able further to support and inculcate

been made, and in all probability, when some temporary consi­  
derations cease, we iViail find&#x27;the feme prirtciplka6ttng there also.  
Sir, it is not surprising,, when wc conlider the nature of!mankind,  
that this mould be the cafe.  
With refpeft, however, to the federal government, there is one  
consideration, wttich flVews in a peculiar manner the neeeflity and  
policy ofpaying a ftri£t attention to this principle. One of the  
greatest objections which has baen made by the opponents of the  
system, which has been admited by its friends, is the extent of  
our limits. It has been aflerted by some, and almost feared by  
others, that within so great a space no free government can exist.  
I hope and trad, that the opinion is fallacious. But at the fame  
time, Sir, acknowleging it to have a certain degree of force, it is  
equally incumbent on those, who wilh well to the Union, that this  
inconvenience (hould be diminiflied as much as poflible. The  
way to diminiftr it, is to place the government in that spot which  
will be lead removed from every part of the empire. Carry it to  
an eccentric position, and it will be equivalent to an extention of  
our limits. And if our limits arc altead-y extended so far as war­  
rants in any degree the apprehension above mentioned, we ought  
to take care not to extend them farther.  
But the truth is, that in every point of view in which we can  
regard this fubjeft, we (hall find it a fubje£fc of importance. It is  
important that every part of the community ftiould have the pow­  
er of fending, with equal facility, to the leat of government such  
reprefenfativesto take charge of their interest as they are moll dit­  
pofed to confide in. If you place the government in an eccentric  
fuuation, the attendance of the members, aid all who are to tTan­  
fa£t the public bufinefc, will not be equally convenient. The  
members of the Union will not have an equal chance of being re­  
presented by men of the bed abilities. You do therefore violate  
the principle of eqnaVtty, in a part which is peculiarly vulnerable.  
If we c/ynTide* the ex pence} that is an inconvenience not without  
its weight.  
in the lad com penfat ions that have been voted, the eccentricity  
of our pofilion has had a difa&amp;reeable influence. The more re­  
mote the government is, the greater will be the neeeflity of making  
liberal coxrtpenfations, and holding out powerful inducements in  
order to obtain Cervice&amp;bk men to reprefenf you ; and you can  
make no diftinftion ; you mufi give to those who have the least  
inconvenience, the fame as those who have the mod. The feat of  
government isof great importance, if you ccmfider the diffuflon oi  
wealth ♦hich proceeds from this source. T presume that the ex­  
penditures that will take place where the government will be  
established, kv those who are immediately concerned in its admi­  
niftr&amp;tion, and by others who may resort to it, will not be less than  
half a million of dollars a yeaT. It is rb be regretted that those  
who may be most convenient to the centre, (hould enjoy those  
blcflings in a higher degree than otheis. But it is an evil which is  
imposed on us by nee- (Iky ; we diminish it as we place the source  
From which those emanations are to proceed, as near the center,  
as poftibte.  
It we confidtr, Sir, the eflVfti of legislative powerS on tlie agv  
enegate community, we mud feel equal inducements to look for  
the centre, in order to find the proper feat of government. Those  
who are most convenient to the feat ©f legislation, will always  
possess advantages over others. An early knowlege of the law,  
an influence incna&amp;ing them, and a thousand other eirtumftanceSj  
will give a tupexiority to those who are thus fltuated. If it were  
pofliMe to proraulge our laws by some indantaneous operation, it  
would be of little consequence iq that point of view where the go­  
vernment wat. But if on the contrary, tittle is neteflTary for this  
purpose, we ought as far as possible, to give every part of the com­  
munity an opportunity of obtaining a traowlcge of the fubje£&gt;.  
If we conliaer the influence of the government in its executive  
department, thfcre is no less reaTon to conclude that it ought to be  
plated in the center of the Union. It ought to be in a situation to  
command information, relative part of the Union, in everv  
conjuncture, to seize every circumdance which can be improvea,  
-id which ought to be attended to. Ode of the most important  
confederations which is pretented by this part of the fuhjett, is the  
niteflky of having the executive eye placed in a situation where it  
can fee the dangers which may threaten, and the executive arm  
placcd also from whence it may be extended, most effe£taally, to  
the protection of every part. Perhaps it is peculiarly neeeflary,  
that in looking for the centre, we (hould keep our eye as much as  
poflib&gt;e to our western borders. For a long time, dangers will  
be molt apt to spring from that quartet.  
In to the Judiciary, if it is not equally tiefceffary, it is yet  
highly important, that the government (hould be equally aceeifible  
to every part of those who are to be governed. Why should the  
citiaeto* of one quarter of the Union be fubjett to greater difficul­  
ties tlan others ? Why ftiotrld they be obliged to travel a greater  
distance thain others-»-to carry their witnefles, and be fubjeft to all  
the im onveniencies attending the administration of justice at a re­  
rrrote distance 7 tn (hort, whether we consider the fubjeft with re­  
gard to the executive, the legiflativef and judicial departments, we  
ferthe founded reasons tor fixing on that place, whtch may be the  
most permanent center of territory and population in refpeft to

fraftding of our feltow-ciligens on tlje Western Waters, to efcpefi  
th&amp;t they will be united with their Atlantic brethren, on any  
other principle than that of equality and justice.  
I venture to fay that it is necessary in order prrferve the  
tlniou, that we (hould «Ual out the bloffings of government with  
an impartial hand, and that in placing the government from which  
these Meflmgs are to flow,, we Ihoula retire from the Atlantic, as  
far as is convenient, and approach that point *rhich will most ac­

one position in preference to another, we have every inducement  
of interest as well as generosity to fix 011 the Patowmac. It is im­  
portable to reflett a moment on the separation of that branch of the  
Unkm, wkhont feerng the mifchiefs which that event must create.  
The area of the United States, when divided into equal parts, will

From the fertility of foil, and the finenefs of clirnate, and every

laws, and pursuing common good, and considering them in the  
  
\_PitbliJhed en Wednesday and Saturday .]  
  
light I have mentioned, presents one of the greatest ideas that can  
fill an American mind. Instead of peace and friendfhip, we shall  
have rivallhip and enmity: Instead of being a great peopie, invul­  
nerable on all (ides, and without the necemty of those eftablilh­  
ments which other nations require, we ftiall have to support e*-  
pensive and dangerous eftablilhments neceflary for defence. We  
lhall be obliged to lay burthens on thte people to support them,  
and which, sooner or later will be fatal to the liberties of Ameri­  
ca. It is incumbeilt on if we wish to ast the part of enlighten­  
ed legislator A. oc magnanimous citizens, t6 confidei* well when We  
are about to Cake a step, that the step be directed by the motives I  
have deferibed. We must confided What.il just, what is equal*  
what is fa,tisfa&amp;ory.  
It may be a{ked why it was neceflary to bring into view these  
principles, since they would not be denied. Sir, I apprehend  
that in general we shall not disagree as to the principle. But at  
the fame time principles are so connetted with fa&amp;s, that it is ne­  
cefTary we (hould collect all the light, and examine all the circum­  
stances which may lead us to a juftdecifion. On a candid view of  
the two rivers, I flatter myfelf that the feat which will most cor­  
respond with the public uttered, will be found on the banks of  
the Patowmac.  
It is proper that we have Tome regard to extent of territory.  
If that is to have weight, give me leave to fay that there isno com­  
parison between the two rivers. I defy any gentlemen to cast  
his eye in the most cursory manner over the most perfect map,  
and fay the Patowmac is not much nearer this center than any  
part of the Sufquehanna. Sir, if we measure from the bank? of  
the Patowmac to the most eastern part of the United States&#x27;, it is  
less distant than from the most southern. If we meafurethis great  
area diagonally, the Patowmac will still be nearer. If you draw  
a line perpendicular to the line of the Atlantic c&#x27;oaft, you will ftnd  
that it will run more equally through the Patowmac, than any other  
part of the Union ; or if there be arty difference between orte fide  
and the others there will be a greater space on the south-west  
than on the north-east. All the maps of the United States shew  
the truth of this. From the Ahmtic coast to that line which sepa­  
rates the BritisH poffefFions from the United States, the average  
distance is not more than 150 miles. If you take the average  
breadth of the other branch of the United States, it will   
to be fxx, seven, and eight hundred miles. From thiiview of the  
fubieft, which it is not ealy to describe by words, I am sure that  
if the Patowmac is not the geographical center, it is because the  
Sufquehanna is le£s so.  
1 acknowlege that sortie regard is 60 be paid to the center of  
population. But where(hall we find this center ? 1 know of n6  
rule by which we may be governed, except by confldering the  
proportion among the Representatives of the different States. 1  
believe, if we take that criterioa, the prcfent center of population  
will be found somewhere in Penafylvania, and not far from the  
Sufquehanua. I acknowlege that the prefeitt center of population  
is nearer the Sufquehanna than the Patowmac. But are we cheof­  
ing a feat of government for the present moment ? Are we to  
confine our attention to the present state of population ? I prcfume  
not* we must look forward to those probable changes that are fooh  
to take place. I appeal to the judgement of ev«ry gentleman, if wo  
have not reafonto fuppofethat those future changesin the population  
of this country will bepirticularty favorable tofhat part which lies  
south of the Patowmac. On what do the measure and extent of  
population depend ? They depend on climate, on the foil and  
the vacancy. We find that population like money seeks those  
places where it can ast with most freedom, and has alwavs a ten­  
dency to equalize itfelf; We fee the people moving from the  
more ciouded to the iefs crouded parts. We fee emigration   
place from the parts that are filled. &quot;The swarms do not conje  
from the southern, but from the northern and eastern hive. This  
will continue to operate till every part of America receives its due  
share of population. If there beany event oh which we may cal­  
culate with tolerable certainty, I take it thac the center of popu­  
lation will continually advance in a south-western dire&amp;ion. It  
must then travel from the Sufquehanna, if it is now found there.  
It may go beyond the Patowmac. But the time will be long firft;  
and if it (hould, the Patowmac is the great highway of commun­  
ication between the Atlantic and the Wefterti Country,   
which wiU justly prevent any attempts to remove the feat further  
south. I have laid, Sir, that the communication to the Western  
Territory is more commodious through the Patowmac than the  
Sufquehanna: I wish all the fa£lt conne6ted with this fubje£fc  
could have been more fully afceitained, and more fully stated. But  
if we coafider the faSs which have been offered by gentlemen who  
spoke, we must conclude that the communication through tlje  
Patowmac would be much more facile and effectual than any  
other,  
Mr. Madison thenftated the different stages ofdiftanceonthe  
two rivers, from which he concluded that the probable distance from  
the place of fixing the government on the Patowmacto Fort Pitt, Ijy  
land, was 170 or l sco miles* and from that part of the Sufquehanna  
which was contemplated, 250, if the courle of the PatoWmac was  
followed, not more than 250, but oa the course of the Sufque­  
hanna, about goo.  
Whether, therefore, said he* we measure the distance by land  
or water, it is in favor of the Patowmac; and if We confidtr the  
progress in optning this great channel, I am confident the cort­  
fideration would be equally favoTable* It has been determined  
by accurate refcarch, that the waters running into the Ohio, may­  
be found not more than two or three miles diflant from those jof  
the Patowmac. This is a fad of peculiar important  
It has been said that if Congress (hould make choice of the Pa­  
towmac, greater discontents would arise, than if they prefered  
the Sufquehanna, I know not the data froni which this opinion  
is drawn. Who will have the best right to complain ? Will it  
be those who may be gratified if the government (hould be fixed  
on the Sufquehanna ? I believe not. &quot;the truth k, that if the  
place (hort of the present geographical center is (hortofthe center  
of population, as it may exist in a reasonable time, we have rea  
son to believe that the southern inhabitants will conceivethem­  
felves most aggrieved. 1 think I may with truth declare, if the­  
feat of government (hould be fixed on the Sufquehanna, every part  
south of that river, and every part of the United States south of  
the Ohio, will conceive that the great principles of equal justice,  
have been disregarded. If we are to consider the fubjeft in that  
point of View, I am sure it is most expedient that we should give  
the preference to Patowmac. This is not all—lf you eftablilh it  
on the Patowmac, those who think themselves not equally dealt  
by, will find the cause of their discontent continually subsiding;  
because the center of population will be continually approaching to  
the geographical center. If on the other hand, you fix the feat in a  
place which is perpetually eccentric with refpettto territory, the  
centerof population will forever recede.  
The gentleman from Massachusetts, yesterday raised great ob»  
je&amp;ions against the Patowmac, because it was, he fuppoied, fuffck  
je£t to periodical maladies from which the other river is free. I  
am not authorised from personal experience, or very particular  
information to draw a comparison between them : there are  
some general fatts that may serve to shew that if there is any dif­  
ference, it is more likely to be in favor of the Patowmac than the  
Sufquehanna. The position contemplated on the banks of the  
former is considerably farther from tide water than the place pro

The entire argument of those urging the Potomac for  
the site of the Capital was that it was the highway to the  
West, and that the West should be consulted, while the  
Northern men pressed the Susquehanna as being the true  
route westward.  
MADISON ON A NeW CAPITAL SITe.  
Perhaps the greatest authority, however, was the fllus-­  
trious James Madison, who spoke as follows on Septem  
ber s, 1189: &quot;An equal attention to the rights of the com  
munity is the basts of republics. If we consider, Sir, the  
effeets of legislative power on the aggregate community,  
we must feel equal inducements to look for the center in  
order to find the present seat of Government. Those who  
are most adjacent to the seat of legislation will always  
possess advantages over others. An earlier knowledge  
of the laws, a greater infinence in enacting them, and a  
thousand other circumstances, will give a superiority to  
those who are thus situated. If we consider the influence  
of the Government in its Executive Department, there is  
no less reason to conclude that it ought to be placed in the  
center of the Union. It ought to be in a situation  
to command information from every part of the Unian:  
to watch every conjecture; to seize every clroumstance­  
that can be improved. The Executive eye ought to be  
placed where it can best see the dangers which threaten;  
and the Executive arm whence it may be extended most  
effectually to the protection of every part. In the Judl-  
clary bepartment, if it is not equally necessary, it is  
highly important that the Government should be equally  
accessible to all. With respect to the Western territory,  
we are not now to expect it, for it would be an affront to  
the understanding of our fellow-citizens of the Western  
waters, that they will be united with their Atlantic  
brethren on any principle than that of equality and juse  
tice. We had every inducement, both of interest and  
prudence, to fix on the Potomac as most satisfactory to  
our Western brethren. He defied any gontleman to cast  
his eye, in the most cursory manner, over a map and say  
that the Potomae is not much nearer this center than  
any part of the Susquehanna. He granted that the pres-  
ent center of population is nearer the Susquehanna than  
the Potomac. But are we choosing a seat of Government  
for the present moment only? He presumed not!

discussion has a particular interest for  
us who live under a network of tele-  
graphic wires. “If,” said he, “it were  
possible to promulgate our laws by  
some instantaneous operation, it would  
be of less consequence, in that point  
of view, where the government might  
be placed.” But even in that case,  
centrality, he thought, would be but  
just, since the government would prob-  
ably expend every year as much as  
half a million of dollars, and every  
citizen should partake of this advan-  
tage as equally as nature had rendered  
it possible.  
  
And so the debate went on day after  
day. The Susquehanna men triumphed  
in the House ; but the Senate sent back  
the bill with “Susquehanna” stricken  
out, and “ Germantown” inserted. The  
House would not accept the amend-
