Henry. Government is dissolved. Fleets and Armies and the present State of Things shew that Government is dissolved.—Where are your Land Marks? your Boundaries of Colonies.  
We are in a State of Nature, Sir. I did propose that a Scale should be laid down. That Part of N. America which was once Mass. Bay, and that Part which was once Virginia, ought to be considered as having a Weight. Will not People complain, 10,000 People Virginians have not outweighed 1000 others.  
I will submit however. I am determined to submit if I am overruled.  
A worthy Gentleman (Ego) near me, seemed to admit the Necessity of obtaining a more Adequate Representation.  
I hope future Ages will quote our Proceedings with Applause. It is one of the great Duties of the democratical Part of the Constitution to keep itself pure. It is known in my Province, that some other Colonies are not so numerous or rich as they are. I am for giving all the Satisfaction in my Power.  
The Distinctions between Virginians, Pensylvanians, New Yorkers and New Englanders, are no more.  
I am not a Virginian, but an American.  
Slaves are to be thrown out of the Question, and if the freemen can be represented according to their Numbers I am satisfyed.  
Mr. Lynch. I differ in one Point from the Gentleman from Virginia, that is in thinking that Numbers only ought to determine the Weight of Colonies. I think that Property ought to be considered, and that it ought to be a compound of Numbers

I think it cannot be now settled.  
Mr. Rutledge. We have no legal Authority and Obedience to our Determinations will only follow the reasonableness, the apparent Utility, and Necessity of the Measures We adopt. We have no coercive or legislative Authority. Our Constitutents are bound only in Honour, to observe our Determinations.  
Govr. Ward. There are a great Number of Counties in Virginia, very unequal in Point of Wealth and Numbers, yet each has a Right to send 2 Members.  
Mr. Lee. But one Reason, which prevails with me, and that is that we are not at this Time provided with proper Materials. I am afraid We are not.  
Mr. Gadsden. I cant see any Way of voting but by Colonies.  
Coll. Bland. I agree with the Gentleman (Ego) who spoke near me, that We are not at present provided with Materials to ascertain the Importance of each Colony. The Question is whether the Rights and Liberties of America shall be contended for, or given up to arbitrary Power.

In 1774, on the fifth of September, the first  
Continental Congress, so called, convened at  
Philadelphia. Patrick Henry was there, and  
spoke for Virginia. After recounting in a  
glowing speech the wrongs inflicted upon the  
c lonics by acts of Parliament, he insisted  
upon necessity of union. “British op­  
pression,” he exclaimed, “has effaced the  
boundaries of the several colonies; the dis­  
tinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvani­  
ans, New Yorkers and&#x27; New Englanders, are  
no more, I am not a Virginian but an Amer­

One hundred years ago to-day, says  
the New York Herald of the 5th instant,  
the first Continental Congress assembled  
in Carpenters&#x27; Hall, Philadelphia, to  
demand of Great Britain redress of the  
grievances the colonies endured. It  
was then that Patrick Henry made the  
noble declaration- the key note of unien

between Virginians, Pennsylvanians,  
New Yorkers and New Englanders are

The &quot;Conservatives&quot; of Louisiana  
have published an appeal to the people  
of the country against the introduction  
of Federal troops into that State. The  
object of the document is to make capi­
