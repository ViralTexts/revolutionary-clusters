 the People of the State of New-York.  
THE tendency of the principle of legislation for States, or communities, in their political capacities, as it has been exemplified by the experiment we have made of it, is equally attested by the events which have befallen all other governments of the confederate kind, of which we have any account, in exact proportion to its prevalence in those systems. The confirmations of this fact will be worthy of a distinct and particular examination. I shall content myself with barely observing here, that of all the confederacies of antiquity, which history has handed down to us, the Lycian and Achæan leagues, as far as there remain vestiges of them, appear to have been most free from the fetters of that mistaken principle, and were accordingly those which have best deserved, and have most liberally received the applauding suffrages of political writers.  
This exceptionable principle may as truly as emphatically be stiled the parent of anarchy: It has been seen that delinquencies in the members of the Union are its natural and necessary offspring; and that whenever they happen, the only constitutional remedy is force, and the immediate effect of the use of it, civil war.  
It remains to enquire how far so odious an engine of government, in its application to us, would even be capable of answering its end. If there should not be a large army, constantly at the disposal of the national government, it would either not be able to employ force at all, or when this could be done, it would amount to a war between different parts of the confederacy, concerning the infractions of a league; in which the strongest combination would be most likely to prevail, whether it consisted of those who supported, or of those who resisted the general authority. It would rarely happen that the delinquency to be redressed would be confined to a single member, and if there were more than one, who had neglected their duty, similarity of situation would induce them to unite for common defence. Independent of this motive of sympathy, if a large and influential State should happen to be the aggressing member, it would commonly have weight enough with its neighbours, to win over some of them as associates to its cause.

es. If associates could not be found at home, recourse would be had to the aid of foreign powers, who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the dissentions of a confederacy, from the firm Union of which they had so much to fear. When the sword is once drawn, the passions of men observe no bounds of moderation. The suggestions of wounded pride, the instigations of irritated resentment, would be apt to carry the States, against which the arms of the Union were exerted to any extremes necessary to revenge the affront, or to avoid the disgrace of submission. The first war of this kind would probably terminate in a dissolution of the Union.  
This may be considered as the violent death of the confederacy. Its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of experiencing, if the fœderal system be not speedily renovated in a more substantial form. It is not probable, considering the genius of this country, that the complying States would often be inclined to support the authority of the Union by engaging in a war against the non-complying States. They would always be more ready to pursue the milder course of putting themselves upon an equal footing with the delinquent members, by an imitation of their example. And the guilt of all would thus become the security of all. Our past experience has exhibited the operation of this spirit in its full light. There would in fact be an insuperable difficulty in ascertaining when force could with propriety be employed. In the article of pecuniary contribution, which would be the most usual source of delinquency, it would often be impossible to decide whether it has proceeded from disinclination, or inability. The pretence of the latter would always be at hand.

, in the majority that happened to prevail in the national council.  
  
It seems to require no pains to prove that the States ought not to prefer a national constitution, which could only be kept in motion by the instrumentality of a large army, continually on foot to execute the ordinary requisitions or decrees of the government. And yet this is the plain alternative involved by those who wish to deny it the power of extending its operations to individuals. Such a scheme, if practicable at all, would instantly degenerate into a military despotism; but it will be found in every light impracticable. The resources of the Union would not be equal to the maintenance of an army considerable enough to confine the larger States within the limits of their duty; nor would the means ever be furnished of forming such an army in the first instance. Whoever considers the populousness and strength of several of these States singly at the present juncture, and looks forward to what they will become, even at the distance of half a century, will at once dismiss as idle and visionary any scheme, which aims at regulating their movements by laws, to operate upon them in their collective capacities, and to be executed by a coertion applicable to them in the same capacities. A project of this kind is little less romantic than that monster-taming spirit, which is attributed to the fabulous heroes and demi-gods of antiquity.  
Even in those confederacies, which have been composed of members smaller than many of our counties, the principle of legislation for sovereign States, supported by military coertion, has never been found effectual. It has rarely been attempted to be employed, but against the weaker members. And in most instances attempts to coerce the refractory and disobedient, have been the signals of bloody wars; in which one half of the confederacy has displayed its banners against the other half.  
The result of these observations to an intelligent mind must be clearly this, that if it be possible at any rate to construct a Fœderal Government capable of regulating the common concerns and preserving the general tranquility, it must be founded, as to the objects committed to its care, upon the reverse of the principle contended for by the opponents of the proposed constitution. It must carry its agency to the persons of the citizens. It must stand in need of no intermediate legislations; but must itself be empowered to employ the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute its own resolutions. The majesty of the national authority must be manifested through the medium of the Courts of Justice. The government of the Union, like that of each State, must be able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals; and to attract to its support, those passions, which have the strongest influence upon the human heart. It must in short, possess all the means and have a right to resort to all the methods of executing the powers, with which it is entrusted, that are possessed and exercised by the governments of the particular States.  
To this reasoning it may perhaps be objected, that if any State should be disaffected to the authority of the Union, it could at any time obstruct the execution of its laws, and bring the matter to the same issue of force, with the necessity of which the opposite scheme is reproached.  
The plausibility of this objection will vanish the moment we advert to the essential difference between a mere NON COMPLIANCE and a DIRECT and ACTIVE RESISTANCE. If the interposition of the State-Legislatures be necessary to give effect to a measure of the Union, they have only NOT TO ACT or TO ACT EVASIVELY, and the measure is defeated. This neglect of duty may be disguised under affected but unsubstantial provisions, so as not to appear, and of course not to excite any alarm in the people for the safety of the constitution. The State leaders may even make a merit of their surreptitious invasions of it, on the ground of some temporary convenience, exemption, or advantage.  
But if the execution of the laws of the national government, should not require the intervention of the State Legislatures; if they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens themselves, the particular governments could not interrupt their progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional power. No omissions, nor evasions would answer the end. They would be obliged to act, and in such a manner, as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights. An experiment of this nature would always be hazardous—in the face of a constitution in any degree competent to its own defence, and of a people enlightened enough to distinguish between a legal exercise and an illegal usurpation of authority. The success of it would require not merely a factious majority in the Legislature, but the concurrence of the courts of justice, and of the body of the people. If the Judges were not embarked in a conspiracy with the Legislature they would pronounce the resolutions of such a majority to be contrary to the supreme law of the land, unconstitutional and void. If the people were not tainted with the spirit of their State representatives, they, as the natural guardians of the constitution, would throw their weight into the national scale, and give it a decided preponderancy in the contest. Attempts of this kind would not often be made with levity or rashness; because they could seldom be made without danger to the authors; unless in cases of a tyrannical exercise of the Fœderal authority.  
If opposition to the national government should arise from the disorderly conduct of refractory, or seditious individuals, it could be overcome by the same means which are daily employed against the same evil, under the State governments. The Magistracy, being equally the Ministers of the law of the land, from whatever source it might emanate, would doubtless be as ready to guard the national as the local regulations from the inroads of private licentiousness. As to those partial commotions and insurrections which sometimes disquiet society, from the intrigues of an inconsiderable faction, or from sudden or occasional ill humours that do not infect the great body of the community, the general government could command more extensive resources for the suppression of disturbances of that kind, than would be in the power of any single member. And as to those mortal feuds, which in certain conjunctures spread a conflagration through a whole nation, or through a very large proportion of it, proceeding either from weighty causes of discontent given by the government, or from the contagion of some violent popular paroxism, they do not fall within any ordinary rules of calculation. When they happen, they commonly amount to revolutions and dismemberments of empire. No form of government can always either avoid or controul them. It is in vain to hope to guard against events too mighty for human foresight or precaution, and it would be idle to object to a government because it could not perform impossibilities.

“The result,” says General Hamilton, “of the observations we have  
made, must be clearly this to an intelligent mind, that if it be possible at  
any rate to construct a federal government, capable of regulating the com-  
mon concerns, and preserving the general tranquillity, it must be founded,  
as to the objects committed to its care, upon the reverse of the principle  
contended for, by the opponents of the proposed constitution,—the restric-  
tion of its authority to the states in their corporate capacity. It must carry  
its agency to the persons of the citizens. It must stand in need of no in-  
termediate legislations, but must itself be impowered, to employ the arm  
of the ordinary magistrate, to execute its own resolutions. The majesty of  
the national authority must be manifested through the medium of the courts  
of justice. The government of the union, like that of each state, must be  
able to address itself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals;  
  
and to attract to its support those passions, which have the strongest influ-  
ence upon the human heart. It must in short have all the means, and have a  
  
right to resort to all the methods, of executing the power with which it is  
  
intrusted, that are possessed and exercised by the governments of the par-  
ticular states.”  
  
It was essential for the proper execution of the task the  
Convention had undertaken, that they should form, in the  
outset of their deliberations, a very clear and determinate  
conception, of the general character and extent of the juris-  
diction, which the federal and state governments were re

&quot;The first war of this kind would probably ter  
  
minate in a dissolution of the Union.  
  
&quot;This way he considered, as the violent death of  
  
the Confederacy. Its more natural death, is what  
  
we now seem to be on the point of experiencing, if  
the Federal system be not speedily renovated in a  
more substantial form.  
  
&quot;It is not probable, considering the genius of the  
  
country, that the complying States would often be  
inclined to support the authority of the Union, by  
engaging in a war with the non-complying States.  
  
They would always be more ready to pursue the  
  
milder course of putting themselves on an equal  
  
footing with the delinquent members, by an imita-  
tion of their example. And the guilt of all would  
thus become the security of all. Our past experi­  
ence has exhibited the operation of this spirit in its  
  
full light. There would, in fact, be an insuperable  
difficulty in ascertaining when force could with  
propriety be employed. In the article of pecuniary  
contribution, which would be the most usual source  
  
of delinquency, it would often be impossible to de  
  
cide whether it had proceeded from disinclination  
  
or inability. The pretence of the latter would al­  
ways be at hand.

cable at all, would instantly degenerate into a mili-  
  
tarp despotism; but it will be found in every light  
  
impracticable. The resources of the Union would  
  
not be able to maintain an army considerable  
  
enough to confine the larger States within the limits  
of their duty; nor would the means ever be furnish  
  
ed of forming such an army in the first instance.  
&quot;A project of this kind is a little less romantic  
  
than the monster having spirit attributed to the fab  
  
ulous heroes and demi-gods of antiquity.  
  
Even in those confederacies which have been  
  
composed of members smaller than many of our  
counties, the principle of legislation for sovereign  
  
States supported by military coercion, has never  
  
been found effectual. It has rarely been attempted  
to be employed, but against the weaker members;  
  
and in most instances attempts to coerce the refrac  
  
tory and disobedient, have been the signals of bloody  
wars, in which one half of the Confederacy has dis  
  
played its banners against the other.  
  
The result of these observations, to an enlighten  
  
ed mind, imust be clearly this: that if it be possible  
at any rate to construct a Federal Government, ca­  
pable of regulating the common concerns the pre  
  
serving the general tranquility, it must be founded  
  
as to the object committed to its care, upon the re  
  
verse of the principle contended for by the oppo  
  
nents of the proposed constitution.  
  
It must carry its agency to the persons of the oit-  
  
izens. It must stand in need of no intermediate leg  
  
islations; but must itself he empawed to employ  
the arm of the ordinary magistrate to execute its  
own resolutions. The majesty of the national au  
  
thority must he manifested through the meotum of

States,) may as truly as emphatically be  
styled the parent of anarchy. It has. been  
seen that delinquencies in the members of  
Union are its natural and necessary offspring;  
and that whenever they happen, the only  
constitutional remedy is force, and the im-  
mediate effect of the use of it, civil war. It  
remains to inquire how far so odious an en-  
gine of government, in its application to us, ~  
would even be capable of answering its end.  
If there should not bea large army constant-  
ly at the disposal of the National Govern-  
ment, it wou&#x27;d either not be able to employ  
force at all, or, when this could be dune, it  
would amount to a war between parts of the  
confederacy, concerning the infractions of a  
league, in which the strongest combination  
would be most likely to prevail, whether it  
consisted of those .who supported or those  
who resisted the general authority. It would  
rarely happen that the delinquencies to be  
redressed would be confined to a single mem-  
ber, and if there were more than one who  
had neglected their duty, similarity of situa-  
tion would induce them, to unite for common

defense. Independent of this motive of sym-  
pathy, if a large and influential State should  
happen to be the aggressive member, it  
would commonly have weight enough with  
its neighbors to win over some of them as  
associates to its cause. % * — If asso-  
ciates could not be found at home, recourse  
would be had to the aid of foreign powers,  
who would seldom be disinclined to encou-  
raging the dissensions of a confederacy, from  
the firm union of which they had so much  
to fear. Whenthe sword is once drawn, the  
passions of men observe no bounds of mode-  
ration. The suggestions of wounded pride,  
the instigations of irritated resentments,  
would be apt to carry the States against  
which arms of the Union were exerted, to  
any extremes necessary to avenge the affront,  
or to avoid the disgrace of submission. The  
first war of this kind would probably termi-  
nate in a dissolution of the Union. This  
may be considered as the violent death of  
the confederacy. - + It seems to  
require no pains to prove that the States  
ought not to prefer a national constitution,  
which could only be kept in motion by the  
instrumentality of a large standing army,  
continually on foot to execute the ordinary  
requirements or decrees of the government.  
Such a scheme, if practicable, would instant-  
Jy degenerate into a military despotism ; but  
it would be found in every light impractica-  
ble. *  * Even in those confedera-  
cis which have been composed of members  
smalier than many of our counties, the  
principle of legislation for sovereign States,  
supported by military coercion, has never  
been found effective. It has rarely been at-  
tempted to be employed but against the  
weaker members ; and in most instances at-  
tempts to coerce the refractory and disohe-  
dient have been the signals of bloody wars,  
in which one half of the confederacy has dis-  
played its banners against the other half.”—

mighty for human foresight or precaution, and it would be idle  
to object to a government because it could not perform impossi-  
bilities.’
