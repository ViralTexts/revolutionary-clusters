minorities whom they will enable to triumph over their more numerous antagonists. so long as republican minorities barely  
accept their votes, no great harm will be done; because it will only place in power one shade of republicanism, instead of  
another. but when they purchase the votes of the federalists by giving them a participation of office, trust &amp; power, it  
is a proof that anti-monarchism is not their strongest passion. I do not think that the republican minority in Pensylvania  
has fallen into this heresy, nor that there are in your state materials of which a minority can be made who will fall into  
it.  
With respect to the tour my friends to the North have proposed that I should make in that quarter, I have not  
made up a final opinion. the course of life which Genl. Washington had run, civil &amp; military, the services he had  
rendered, and the space he therefore occupied in the affections of his fellow citizens, take from his examples the weight  
of precedents for others, because no others can arrogate to themselves the claims which he had on the public homage. to  
myself therefore it comes as a new question, to be viewed under all the phases it may present. I confess that I am not  
reconciled to the idea of a chief magistrate parading himself through the several states as an object of public gaze, &amp;  
in quest of an applause which, to be valuable, should be purely voluntary. I had rather acquire silent good will by a  
faithful discharge of my duties, than owe expressions of it to my putting myself in the way of recieving them. were I to  
make such a tour to Portsmouth or Portland, I must do it to Savanna, perhaps to Orleans &amp; Frankfort. as I have never yet  
seen the time when the public business would have permitted me to be so long in a situation in which I could not carry it  
on, so I have no reason to expect that such a time will come while I remain in office. a journey to Boston or Portsmouth,  
after I shall be a private citizen, would much better harmonize with my feelings, as well as duties: and, founded in  
curiosity, would give no claims to an extension of it. I should see my friends too more at our mutual ease, and be left  
more exclusively to their society. however, I end as I begun, by declaring I have made up no opinion on the subject, &amp;  
that I reserve it as a question for future consideration &amp; advice. in the mean time, and at all times I salute you with  
great respect and esteem.

NErEK RE.ID.  
On June 19, 1807, in a private letter dated  
at Washington to Gov. Sullivan of Massa.­  
chusetts, President Thomas Jefferson expressed  
his views upon the propriety of pleasure jaunts  
by the Lxecutive as follows:  
With respect to the tour my friends to the  
North have proposed I should make in that  
quarter, I have not made up, a final opinion,  
The course of life which Genr Washington had  
run, civil and military, the services he had ren­  
dered, and the space he therefore occupied in  
the affections of his fellow citizens, take from  
his example the weight of precedents for others,  
because no others can arrogate to themselves  
the claims which he had on the public homage.  
To myself, therefore, iscomes as a new ques­  
tion, to be yiewed under in the phases it may  
present. I confess that I am not reconciled to  
the idea of a Chief Magistrate parading himself  
through the several States as an object of public  
gaze, and in quest of an applause, which, to be  
valuable, should be purely voluntary. I had  
rather acquire silent good will by a faithful dis-  
charge of my duties, than owe expressions of it to  
my putting myself in the way of receiving them.  
Were I to make such a tour to Portsmouth or  
Portland I must do it to Savannah, perhaps to  
Orleans and Frankfort. As I have never yet  
seen the time when the public business would  
have permitted me to be so long in a situation  
in which I could not carry it on, so I have no  
reason to expect that such a time will come  
while I remain in office. A journey to Boston  
or Portsmouth, after I shall be a private citizen,  
would much better harmonize with my feelings,  
as well as duties; and, founded in curiosity,  
would give no claims to an extension of it. I  
should see my friends, too, more at our mutual  
ease, and be left more exclusively to their so­  
iety. However, I end, as I began, by declaring  
I have made up no opinion on the subject, and  
that I reserve it as a question for future con­  
sideration and advice.  
In the mean time, and at all times, I salute  
you with great respect and esteem.  
TH. JEFFERSON
