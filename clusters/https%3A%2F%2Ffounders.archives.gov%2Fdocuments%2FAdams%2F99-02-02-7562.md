I have given ample proof that such were the views of the leaders. For this I might rest satisfied with a bare reference to the work itself, of which whole chapters contain the evidence. But to save you the trouble of examination, I answer a brief sketch of a part of the proof on which the accusation restsTreason was publically preached in the temples of the Living God, when his  creatures went to celebrate his worship—&amp; to evince their approbation of the execrable doctrines, many of those sermons to which the authors deserved to be consigned to penitentiaries, they were ordered to be printed.The rev Mr. Gardiner, in a sermon preached in Boston July 23, 1812, boldly informed his Congregation—“If you do not wish to become the slaves of those who own slaves &amp; who are themselves the slaves of French slaves, you must either, in the language of the day, cut the Connexion, or  so far alter the national Constitution as to insure yourselves a due share in the govt.It was a farce to suppose that during a time of war the Constitution could be altered to put the views of their mouthpieces  of treason, &amp; therefore the only alternative was “cutting the connexion” that is, a separation of the states, with all its bloody consequences.The rev Mr Osgood, in a sermon delivered the same day, at Medford—says.“If at the present no symptoms of civil war appear, they certainly will soon, unless the courage of the war party fail them”—Treachery—“Once hope only remains, that this last stroke of perfidy,” [i.e. the declaration of war against a nation which had unceasingly goaded us,  by almost every possible outrage for fifteen years] “may open the eyes of a besotted &amp; most wretchedly deluded people, that they may awake like a giant from his slumbers, &amp; wreak their vengeance on their betrayers, by driving them from their stations, &amp; placing at helm more skilful &amp; faithful hands.” Now, sir can you for a moment persuade yourself, that this means any thing else but civil wa
