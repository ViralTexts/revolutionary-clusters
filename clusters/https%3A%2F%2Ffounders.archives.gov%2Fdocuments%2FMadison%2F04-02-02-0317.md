If the extract be a fair sample, the work about to be published will not have the value claimed for it. Who can believe that so palpable a mistatement was made on the floor of the Convention, as that the several States were political Societies, varying from the lowest Corporation to the highest Sovereign; or that the States had vested all the essential rights of sovereignty in the Old Congress? This intrinsic evidence alone ought to satisfy every candid reader of the extreme incorrectness of the passage in question. As to the remark that the States ought to be under the controul of the Genl. Govt. at least as much as they formerly were under the King &amp; B. Parliament, it amounts as it stands when taken in its presumable meaning, to nothing more than what actually makes a part of the Constitution; the powers of Congs. being much greater, especially on the great points of taxation &amp; trade than the B. Legislature were ever permitted to exercise.  
Whatever may have been the personal worth of the 2 delegates from whom the materials in this case were derived, it cannot be unknown that they represented the strong prejudices in N.Y. agst. the object of the Convention which was among other things to take from that State the important power over its commerce to which it was peculiarly attached, and that they manifested, untill they withdrew from the Convention, the strongest feelings of dissatisfaction agst. the contemplated change in the federal system and as may be supposed, agst. those most active in promoting it. Besides misapprehensions of the ear therefore, the attention of the notetaker wd. naturally be warped, as far at least as an upright mind could be warped, to an unfavorable understanding of what was said in opposition to the prejudices felt.

the incorrectness of the Report in these particular  
passages ; and we could mention others, the accuracy  
ol which is &lt;|uestionablo. As to the remark nttribut­  
eil to the gentleman liist named above, licit the states  
ought to be under Hie control of the genciul govern­  
mental least ns much as they formerly ,woro under  
the King and ltriiisji Parliament, it amounts ns it

ly ou the great points of taxation and trade Mini) the

It is known that the two Delegates from whom the  
materials for this volume are derived, represented in  
the Coutcutioii the strong prejudices of New York a­  
gaiust the object uf the convention, which was, among  
other things, to take from that stale the power over  
its trade, to xyhich it xvas peculiarly attached, and  
that they manifested, unti 11&#x27;Ti withdrexv from the  
Convention, the strongest feelings of dissatisfaction  
against the contemplated change in the federal sys­  
tem ; and, as may be supposed, against those most ac­  
livo iiii promoting it. We are authorised, therefore,  
to believe, that, xvlmlcver tuav have been the person­  
al xvortli of those Delegates, the attention of the note­  
taker, to say nothing of misapprehensions of the ear,  
might naturally be warped, as far at least ns an u|&gt;­
