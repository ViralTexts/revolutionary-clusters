licit the continuance of them to those who yet call for your friendly assistance— you learnt by Captain Barnard that I was going a journey. I have given your mamma and sister some account of my late excursion to Devonshire. we returnd Home through Bristol and took oxford in our way, from Whence we went to Woodstock and visited Blenheim, the Seat of the Duke of Marlborough, which was built at the publick expence, and Granted by the crown to the Duke for the services he had renderd his Country. this Castle is upon the Grandest scale of any thing I have ever yet seen. We enter the park through a spacious and elegant portal of the Corinthian order, from whence a Noble prospect is opend to the palace, the Bridge the Lake, with its valley, and other beautifull Scenes. the Front of this Noble Ediface which is of Stone, is 348 feet from wing to wing. on the pediment of the South Front, towards the Garden is a Noble Busto of Louis the 14th, taken by the Duke from the Gates of Tournay. this the Gardner told us, he never faild pointing out to all the French Gentlemen who visited the place and that, they shrugd their shoulders, &amp; mon dieu’d.— but before I describe to you the Gardens, I will attempt to give you a short, tho imperfect account of the palace, it would require a week to view it, &amp; a volm to describe it particularly; I will therefore only collect from my little journal, the most remarkable objects.— we enterd the palace through a magnificent Hall supported by Corinthian pillars, over the door going into the Salon, is a Bust of John Duke of Marlborough and two statues in Bronz, viz the venus of medicis &amp; a Faun. the Ceiling is painted Allegorically, Representing victory crowning John Duke of Marlborough, and pointing to a plan of the Battle of Blenhiem. from the Salon we pass through a Suit of Rooms, all of them containing a most costly &amp; Beautifull collection of paintings, many of them originals of the first masters. in the dining Room is a family peice, the present Duke &amp; duchess and six of th

This Library was originally intended as a Gallery for paintings but the Late Duke of Marlborough, chose to have it furnishd with the Noble collection of Books made by Lord Sunderland, his Graces Father which amounts to 24.000 volums; and is said to be the best private collection in England: they are kept under Gilt wire lattices: and make a superb appearence. at one end of the Room is a highly finishd Marble statue of Queen Ann, with this inscription, “To the memory of Queen Anne under whose Auspices John duke of Marlborough conquerd, And to whose Munificence, He, and his posterity, with Gratitude owe the possession of Blenheim in A D. 1746.[”] There are Two marble Busts over the Chimny, one of Charles Earl of Sunderland, who collected the Books, and an other of Charles Spencer Duke of Marlborough and at the further End of the room, is a fine Greek Bust of Alexander the Great, and 14teen full length family portraits. from two Bow windows in this Noble Gallery, the Eye is delighted with a view of the declivity descending to the water, and the gradual assent of the venerable Grove which covers the opposite hill.

Elizabeth, afterwards Queen, was kept a prisoner here,  
under the persecutions of Queen Mary.  
  
This palace retained its original splendor, and was  
inhabited by our kings, till the reign of Charles I. but  
began to be demolished in the succeeding times of con-  
fusion. Its magnificent ruins were remaining within  
the memory of man, near the bridge, to the north, on  
the spot where two sycamores have been Since planted

HE Caſtle of BLENHEIM, the ſeat of His Grace

of Woodſtock, a market and borough town, about ſeven  
miles and a half from Oxford,  
  
From the town we enter the Park through a 3  
portal of the Corinthian order; from whence a noble  
proſpect is opened to the Caſtle, the Bridge, the Lake  
with its Valley, and other beautiful ſcenes of the Park.  
The Houſe in particular. which we ſurvey from this  
point obliquely, is probably no where viewed to greater  
advantage.  
  
The front is 348 feet from wing to wing, and conſiſts  
of a variety of architecture, deſigned by Sir John Van-  
brugh. On the pediment of the ſouth front towards the  
garden is a noble Buſto, larger than the life, of Louis XIV.  
taken from the gates of Tournay.  
  
We enter the Houſe on the eaſt, through a portal  
built in the ſtyle of martial architecture, on the top of  
which is a reſervoir, which ſupplies the houſe with  
water from the river, This leads us into a quadrangle
