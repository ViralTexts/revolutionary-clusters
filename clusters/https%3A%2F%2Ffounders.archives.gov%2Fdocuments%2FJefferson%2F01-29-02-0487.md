Mr. Jay will observe that the subject to which his remark No. 15. applies is one instance among many which might be brought to shew that this article would not be inefficient. 14. To meet the object which was this morning suggested in conversation on this article Ld. G. would propose the adoption of the following additional article to come in immediately after the 8th. Ld. G. has in conformity to what was mentioned by Mr. Jay used the words of Vattel. ‘In order to regulate what is in future to be esteemed contraband’ &amp;c as in 18. of treaty to end of paragraph ‘to an

. My opinion of the treaty is apparent from my having signed it. I have no reason to believe or conjecture that one more favorable to us is attainable. Perhaps it is not very much to be regretted that all our differences are merged in this treaty, without having been decided. Disagreeable imputations are thereby avoided and the door of conciliation is fairly and widely opened by the essential justice done, and the conveniences granted to each other by the parties.

That the returns for those goods cannot be drawn into Canada at an earlier period: that the impression which the surrender of all the posts to Amer. garrisons will make on the minds of the Indns. cannot be foreseen. On a former occasion it was intimated to them (not very delicately) that they had been forsaken and given up to the US. That the protection promised on our part, however sincere, and however in other respects competent, cannot entirely prevent those embarrasments which, without our fault, may be occasioned by the war. That for these reasons the traders ought to have time to conclude their adventures which were calculated on the existing state of things. They will afterwards calculate on the new state of things; but that in the mean time the care of government should not be withdrawn from them
