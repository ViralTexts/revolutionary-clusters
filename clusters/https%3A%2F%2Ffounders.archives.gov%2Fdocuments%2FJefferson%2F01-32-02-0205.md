ddress you. Tho’ our information of the votes of the several states be not official, yet they are stated on such evidence as to satisfy both parties that the Republican vote has been successful. we may therefore venture to hazard propositions on that hypothesis without being justly subjected to raillery or ridicule. the constitution, to which we are all attached, was meant to be republican, and we believe it to be republican according to every candid interpretation. yet we have seen it so interpreted and administered, as to be truly, what the French have called it, a monarchie masquée. so long however has the vessel run on in this way, and been trimmed to it, that to put her on her republican tack will require all the skill, the firmness &amp; the zeal of her ablest &amp; best friends. it is a crisis which calls on them, to sacrifice all other objects, and repair to her aid in this momentous operation. not only their skill is wanting, but their names also. it is essential to assemble in the outset persons to compose our administration, whose talents, integrity and revolutionary name &amp; principles may inspire the nation  at once with unbounded confidence, impose an awful silence on all the maligners of republicanism; and suppress in embryo the purpose avowed by one of their most daring &amp; effective chiefs, of beating down the administration. these names do not abound at this day. so few are they, that your’s, my friend cannot be spared from among them without leaving a blank which cannot be filled. if I can obtain for the public the aid of those I have contemplated, I fear nothing. if this cannot be done, then are we unfortunate indeed! we shall be unable to realize the prospects which have been held out to the people, and we must fall back into monarchism, for want of heads, not hands, to help us out of it. this is a common cause my dear Sir, common to all republicans. tho’ I have been too honorably placed in front of those who are to enter th

Dear Sir : ** &quot; Though our informa­  
tion of the votes of the several States bo not  
official, yet they arc stated on such evidence a*  
to satisfy both parties that the Republican vote  
has been successful. The Constitution, to  
which we are all attached, was meant to be  
Republecan, according to every candid interpreta­  
tion. Yet, we have seen it so interpreted and  
administered as to be truly what the French  
called it, a monarchic masque. Yet so long has  
the vine run on this way, and been trimmed  
to it that, to put her on her Republican track  
will require all the skill, the firmness, and the  
zeal, ol her ablest and tesst friends. It is a  
crisis which calls on them to saeiitice all other  
objects, and tepaie to her aid in this moment­  
ous operation! Nut only tbeir skill is want­  
ing, but their names also. It is essential to  
assemble, in the outset, persons to compose  
our Administration, whose talents, integrity,  
and revolutionary name and principles, may  
inspire the nation at ouee with unbounded  
confidence, and impose an awful silence on the  
maligners of Republicanism; as may suppress  
in embryo the purpose avowed by one ut their  
most daring chiefs, ot beating down the Ad­  
ministration. * * * This is a common cause  
my dear sir, to all Republicans. * * * Come  
forward, then, my dear sir, and give us the aid  
of your talents aud tho weight of your charac­  
ter towards the new establishment of Republic­  
anism; I say for its new establishment; for  
hitherto we have seen only its travestie. *
