ealous in its favour; and as far as I can judge the opinions in Senate are very equally divided—The probability seems to me that the bill will pass—  
This day there is a subscription dinner given at Stelle’s to Captain Lewis, of which and of its toasts I suppose the newspapers will give account—I shall not be present, though I think Captain Lewis deserves much more than a dinner—Indeed I have no opinion of this species of payment for public services—  
Kiss my dear boys for me, and believe me ever affectionately yours

To Mrs: Hellen. on the 19. Septr: 1803. and 19. Decr: 1806.  
Sure, to the mansions of the blest  
When Infant Innocence ascends,  
Some Angel, brighter than the rest  
The spotless Spirit’s flight attends.  
On wings of ecstasy they rise  
Beyond where worlds material roll;  
Till some fair Sister of the Skies  
Receives the unpolluted Soul.  
There, at th’Almighty father’s hand,  
Nearest the throne of living light,  
The choirs of Infant Seraphs stand,  
And dazzling shine, where all are bright.  
Chain’d for a dreary length of years  
Down to these Elements below,  
Some stain, the sky-born Spirit bears,  
Contracted from this world of woe.  
That inextinguishable beam,  
With dust united at our birth,  
Sheds a more dim, discolour’d gleam,  
The more it lingers upon Earth.  
Clos’d in this dark abode of clay  
The stream of glory faintly burns;  
Nor unobscur’d the lucid ray  
To its own native fount returns.  
But when the Lord of mortal breath  
Decrees his bounty to resume,  
And points the silent shaft of Death,  
Which speeds an Infant to the tomb—  
No Passion fierce—no low desire  
Has quench’d the radiance of the flame—  
Back to its God, the living fire  
Reverts, unclouded as it came—  
Oh! Nancy! be that solace thine:  
Let Hope her healing charm impart;  
And soothe, with melodies divine,  
The Anguish of a Mother’s Heart.  
Oh! think, the darlings of thy love,  
Divested of this earthly clod;  
Amid unnumber’d Saints above,  
Bask in the bosom of their God.  
Of their short pilgrimage on Earth,  
Still tender images remain—  
Still, still they bless thee for their birth,  
Still, filial Gratitude retain.  
The days of pain, the Nights of Care  
The bosom’s agonizing strife  
The pangs which thou for them didst bear,  
No!—they forget them not with life.  
Scarce could their germing thoughts conceive  
While in this vale of tears they dwelt—  
Scarce their fond Sympathy relieve  
The suffrance thou for them hast felt.  
But there—the soul’s perennial flower  
Expands in never-fading bloom;  
Spurns at the Grave’s poor transient hour,  
And shoots immortal from the tomb.  
No weak, unform’d idea there,  
Toils—the mere promise of a Mind—  
The tide of Intellect flows clear,  
Strong, full, unchanging and refin’d.  
Each anxious care, each rending sigh  
That wrung for them the Parents Breast,  
Dwells on remembrance in the sky,  
Amid the raptures of the blest.  
O’er thee, with looks of love they bend.  
For thee the Lord of life implore;  
And oft from sainted bliss descend,  
Thy wounded quiet to restore.  
Oft in the stillness of the Night  
They smooth the pillow for thy bed:  
Oft till the Morn’s returning light,  
Still watchful hover o’er thy head.  
Hark! in such strains as Saints employ,  
They whisper to thy bosom, Peace:  
Calm the perturbed heart to joy,  
And bid the streaming Sorrow cease.  
There dry henceforth the bitter tear—  
Their part and thine inverted see!—  
Thou wert their guardian Angel, here,  
They guardian Angels now to thee

POETRY.  
LINES.  
ADDRESSED to a mother, on the death  
OK TWO INFANTS.  
rAttributed to the Hun. J. Q Adams.]  
Sure, to the mansions of the blest,  
When infant innocence ascends,  
Some angel brighter than the test  
The spotless spirit,* flight attends.  
On wings of ectasy they rise,  
Beyond where worlds material roll;

Extracted from the world of wo.  
  
That unexiinguisuiii-Mc wta...,  
With dust united at our birth,  
Sheds a nioie dim discolor’d gleam,  
The more it lingers on this earth.  
Clos’d in this dafk abode of clay,  
The stream of glory faintly burns;  
Nor unouscur’d the lucid ray  
To its own native fount returns.  
But when the Lord of mortal breath  
Decrees his bounty to resume,  
And points the silent shaft of death,  
Which speeds an infa.it to the tomb.  
No passion fierce, no low desire,  
H as quench&#x27;d the radiance ol the flame, j  
Back to its God the living fire  
Reverts, unclouded as it came.  
Oh Mary! be that solace thine:  
Let hope her healing charm impart,  
And sooth with melodies divine  
The anguish of a mother’s heart  
Old think the darlings of thy love,  
* Divested of this earthly clod,  
Amid unnumbered saints above,  
Bask in the bosom of their God.  
Of their short pilgrimage on earth  
, Still tender imagines remain;  
Still, filial gratitude retain.  
The days of pain, the nights of care,  
The bosom’s agonizing strife,  
The pangs which thou lor them didst bear,  
No! they forget them not with life.  
Searce could their germing throught con­  
ceive  
While in this vale of tears they dwelt,  
Scarce their fond sympathy relieve  
The suff’rance thou lor them has felt.  
But there the soul’s perenmel flower  
Expands ui never-fading bloom;  
Spurns at the graves’ poor transient hour,  
And shoots immortal from the tomb.  
No weak unform d idea there  
Toils, the mere promise of a mind;  
The tide of intellect flows clear,  
Strong, full, unchangiug and refin’d.  
Each anxious care, each rending sigh,  
That wrung for them thejparent’s breast  
Dwells on remembrance in the sky,  
Amid the raptures of the blest.  
O’er thee with looks of love they bend,  
For thee the Lord 6f Life implore;  
And oft from sainted bliss descend,  
Thy wounded quiet to restore.  
Oft in the stillness of the night,  
They smooth the pillow for thy bed;  
Of* till the morn’s returning light *  
Still watchful hover o’er thy head,  
Hark! in such strains employ  
They whisper to thy bosom peace;  
Calm the perturbed heart to joy,

Then dry henceforth the bitter hear,

y the person to whom  
they are attributed. The sentiments are both philo-  
sophical and classical. Some of the stanzas are little  
more than an elegant translation of a passage m the  
sixth book of the Zzneid, in which Virgil discourses  
of the Socratic and Platonic system of Philosophy--——  
  
The doctrine however is beautifully blendid and har-  
  
monized with the christian religion. Parts of this ele-  
  
gy manifest a delicacy of feeling, a tenderness and  
pathos, which have generally been supposed not to  
belong to the character of the author :”  
  
LINES  
Addressed to a Mother, on the Death of two w/fanis.  
Sure to the mansions of the blest,  
When infant innocence ascends,  
Some angel brighter than the rest  
The spotless spirits flight attends.  
  
  
  
On wings of ecstacy they rise  
Beyond where worlds material roll ;  
Till some fair sister of the skies  
Receives the unpolluted soul.  
  
There at th’ Almighty Father’s hand,  
Nearest the throne of living light,  
  
The choirs of infant seraphs stand,  
And dazzling shine, where all are bright.  
  
Chain’d for a dreary length of years  
Down to these elements below,  
Some stain the sky-born spirit bears,  
Extracted from this world of wo.  
  
That unhextinguishable beam,  
With dust united at our birth,  
Sheds a more dim discolour’d gleam,  
The more it lingers on this earth.  
  
Clos’d in this dark abode of clay,  
The stream of glory faintly burns ;  
Not unobscur’d the lucid ray  
To its own native fount returns.  
  
But when the Lord of mortal breath  
Decrees his bounty to resume,  
  
And points the silent shaft of death,  
Which speeds an infant to the tomb,  
  
No passions fierce, no low desire,  
  
Has quench’d the radiance of the flame :  
Back to its God the living fire  
  
Reverts unclouded as it came.  
  
Oh Mary! be that solace thine,  
  
Let hope her Healing charm impart,  
And soothe with melodies divine  
  
The anguish of a mother’s heart.  
  
Oh! think the darlings of thy love,  
Divested of this earthly clod,  
  
Amid unnumber’d saints above,  
Bask in the bosom of their God.  
  
Of their short pilgrimage on earth  
Still tender images remain ;  
  
Still, still they bless thee for their birth,  
Still filial gratitude retain.  
  
The days of pain, the nights of care,  
The bosom’s agonizing strife,  
  
The pangs which thou for them didst bear,  
No! they forgot them not with life.  
  
Scarce could their germing thought conceive,  
While in this vale of tears they dwelt,  
Scarce their fond sympathy relieve  
The suff’rance thou for them hast felt.  
  
But there the soul’s perennial flower  
Expands in never-fading bloom ;  
  
Spurns at the grave’s poor transient hour,  
And shoots immortal from the tomb.  
  
No weak unform’d idea there  
Toils, the mere promise of a mind ;  
The tide of intellect flows clear,  
Strong, full, unchanging and refin’d.  
  
Each anxious care, each rending sigh,  
That wrung for them the parent’s breast,  
Dwells on remembrance in the sky,  
Amid the raptures of the blest.  
  
O’er thee with looks of love they bend,  
For thee the Lord of life implore ;  
  
And oft from sainted bliss descend,  
Thy wounded quiet to restore.  
  
Oft in the stillness of the night,  
They smooth the pillow of thy bed ;  
Oft till the morn’s returning light  
Still watchful hover o’er thy head.  
  
Hark! in such strains as saints employ  
They whisper to thy bosom, Peace ;  
Calm the perturbed heart to joy,  
And bid the streaming sorrow cease.  
  
Then dry henceforth the bitter tear,  
Their part and thine inverted see!  
  
Thou wert their guardian angel here,  
They guardian angels now to thee

Still, still she thanks thee for her birth,

The days of pain, the nights of care,  
The spirit’s agonizing strife,  
  
The pangs that thou for her didst bear,  
No! she forgets them not with life.  
  
Searce could her germing thoughts conceive,

Soctiral.  
ON THN DEATH OF CHIL DAEN.  
BY JOHN G. ADAMs.  
Sure, to the mansions of the blest,  
When infant innocence ascends,  
Some angel brighter than the rest  
The spotless spirit&#x27;s flight attends.  
On wings of ecstacy they rise  
Beyond where worlds material roll,  
Till some fair sister of the skies  
Receives the unpolluted soul.  
There, at the Almnighty Father&#x27;s hand,  
Nearest the throne of living light,  
The choirs of infant seraphs stand,  
And daxzling shine, where all are bright.  
The unextinguishable beam,  
 With dust united at our birth,  
 Wheds a more dim, discolored gleam,  
The more it lingers upon earth.  
 Clesed in his dark abode of clay,  
 The stream of glory faintly burns,  
Nor unobscured the lucid ray,  
To its own native fount returns.  
  
But when the Lord of moral breath  
Decrees his bounty to resume,  
And points the silent shaft of death  
Which speeds an infant to the tomb-  
  
No passion fierce, no low desire,  
H as quenched the radiance of the flame;  
Back to its God the living fire  
Returns, unsullied, as it came.

Hark! in such strains as saints employ,   
They whisper to thy bosom peace;   
Calm the perturbed heart to joy,   
And bid the streaming Borrow cease.   
Then dry, henceforth, the bitter tear;

The Death cif an Tnlant  
The following beautiful Hymn, ism the Spring­  
field Collection, compiled .by the Rev. W. B, 0.  
Peabody. It was written by Jcb.n Qumey Adams,  
.and will bear a comparison for harmony of ver­  
sification, and elevated sentiment, with anything  
of the kind in the English Language :  
Sure, to the mansions of the blest,-V,hen  
infant innocence ascendd,  
Some angel brighter than the re&amp;t,  
The spotless spirit&#x27;s flight attends. .  
That inextinguishable beam,  
With dust united at our birth, &quot;  
Sheds a more dim, discolored gleam,  
The more it lingers upon earth.  
But when the Lord of mortal breath,  
Decrees his bounty to resume,  
And points the silent shaft of death  
&quot;Which speeds an infant to the tomb; .  
Xo passion fierce, no low desire,  
lias quenched the radiance of the flame;  
Back to its God the living fire  
Keverts, unclouded as it came.  
Then at the Heavenly Father&#x27;s hand,  
Nearest the throne of living light.  
Behold the infant seraph stand,  
And dazzling shine where all are bright.
