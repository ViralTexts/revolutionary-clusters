In obedience to the order of the House of Representatives, of the ninth day of August last, requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare and report, on this day, such further provision as may, in his opinion, be necessary for establishing the public credit  
The said Secretary  
Respectfully reports  
That the object, which appears to be most immediately essential to the further support of public credit, in pursuance of the plan adopted during the last session of Congress, is, the establishment of proper and sufficient funds, for paying the interest which will begin to accrue, after the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety one, on the amount of the debts of the several States, assumed by the United States; having regard at the same time, to the probable, or estimated deficiency in those already established, as they respect the original debt of the Union.  
In order to this, it is necessary, in the first place, to take a view of the sums requisite for those purposes.  
  
  
  The amount, which has been assumed, of the State Debts is  
Dollars 21,500,000

Making together  
Dollars.  826,624.7⟨3⟩  
  
  
For procuring which sum, the reiterated reflections of the Secretary have suggested nothing so eligible and unexceptionable, in his judgment, as a further duty on foreign distilled spirits, and a duty on spirits distilled within the United States, to be collected in the mode delineated in the plan of a bill, which forms a part of his report to the house of Representatives, of the ninth day of January last.  
Under this impression, he begs leave, with all deference, to propose to the consideration of the House—  
That the following additions be made to the duties, on distilled spirits, imported from foreign countries, which are specified in the act making further provision for the payment of the debts of the United States, namely—  
  
  
On those of the first class of proof therein mentioned  
⅌ Gallon. eight Cents  
  
  
On those of the second class.  
⅌ Gallon eight &amp; a half Cents  
  
  
On those of the third class.  
⅌ Gallon nine Cents  
  
  
On those of the fourth class.  
⅌ Gallon ten Cents  
  
  
On those of the fifth Class.  
⅌ Gallon ten Cents  
  
  
On those of the sixth class.  
⅌ Gallon fifteen Cents  
  
  
And that the following duties be laid on spirits distilled within the United States, namely—If from molasses, sugar or other foreign materials; and of the first class of proof …  
  
  
  
⅌ Gallon Eleven Cents  
  
  
— Of the said second Class of proof  
⅌ Galln. twelve Cents  
  
  
— Of the said third Class of proof  
⅌ Galln. thirteen Cents  
  
  
— Of the said fourth Class of proof  
⅌ Galln. fifteen Cents  
  
  
— Of the said fifth Class of proof  
⅌ Galln. Twenty Cents  
  
  
— Of the said sixth Class of proof  
⅌ Galln. Thirty Cents  
  
  
If from materials of the growth or production of the United States distilled within any city, town or village; and  
  
  
— Of the said first class of proof  
⅌ Gallon nine Cents  
  
  
— Of the said second class of proof  
⅌ Galln. ten Cents  
  
  
— Of the said third class of proof  
⅌ Galln. eleven Cents  
  
  
— Of the said fourth class of proof  
⅌ Galln. thirteen Cents  
  
  
— Of the said fifth class of proof  
⅌ Galln. seventeen Cents  
  
  
— Of the said sixth class of proof  
⅌ Galln. twenty five Cents  
  
  
And upon each still employed in distilling spirits from the like materials in any other place than a city, town or village, in lieu of the rates above mentioned, the yearly sum of sixty Cents, for every gallon english wine measure of the capacity of such still, including its head; exempting nevertheless all such stills, within a certain defined dimension, as are used essentially for domestic purposes of their respective proprietors.  
The product of these several duties (which correspond in their rates with those proposed in the report above referred to, of the ninth of January last) may, upon as good grounds as the nature of the case will admit, prior to an experiment, be computed at Eight hundred and seventy seven thousand and five hundred Dollars; the particulars of which computation are contained in the statement which accompanies this report.  
This computed product exceeds the sum which has been stated as necessary to be provided, by fifty thousand eight hundred and seventy five Dollars, and twenty seven Cents; an excess, which if it should be realised by the actual product, may be beneficially applied, towards increasing the sinking fund.  
The Secretary has been encouraged to renew the proposition of these duties, in the same form, in which they were before submitted, from a belief, founded on circumstances, which appeared in the different discussions of the subject, that collateral considerations, which were afterwards obviated, rather than objections to the measure itself, prevented its adoption, during the last session; from the impracticability, which he conceives to exist of devising any substitute equally conducive to the ease and interest of the community; and from an opinion, that the extension of the plan of collection, which it contemplates, to the duties already imposed on wines and distilled spirits, is necessary to a well grounded reliance on their efficacy and productiveness.  
The expediency of improving the resource of distilled spirits, as an article of revenue, to the greatest practicable extent, has been noticed upon another occasion. Various considerations might be added to those, then adduced, to evince it. But they are too obvious to justify the detail. There is scarcely an attitude, in which the object can present itself, which does not invite, by all the inducements of sound policy and public good, to take a strong and effectual hold of it.  
The manner of doing it, or in other words, the mode of collection, appears to be the only point, about which a difficulty or question can arise. If that suggested be liable to just objections, the united information and wisdom of the legislative body ensure the substitution of a more perfect plan.  
The Secretary, however, begs leave to remark, that there appear to him two leading principles; one, or the other, of which, must necessarily characterise whatever plan may be adopted. One of them makes the security of the revenue to depend chiefly on the vigilance of the public officers; the other rests it, essentially, on the integrity of the individuals, interested to avoid the payment of it.  
The first is the basis of the plan submitted by the Secretary; the last has pervaded most, if not all the systems, which have been hitherto practiced upon, in different parts of the United States. The oaths of the dealers have been almost the only security for their compliance with the laws.  
It cannot be too much lamented, that these have been found an inadequate dependence. But experience has, on every trial, manifested them to be such. Taxes or duties, relying for their collection on that security, wholly, or almost wholly, are uniformly unproductive: And they cannot fail to be unequal, as long as men continue to be discriminated, by unequal portions of rectitude. The most conscientious will pay most; the least conscientious, least.  
The impulse of interest, always sufficiently strong, acts with peculiar force in matters of this kind; in respect to which a loose mode of thinking is too apt to prevail. The want of a habit of appreciating properly the nature of the public rights renders that impulse, in such cases, too frequently an overmatch for the sense of obligation: And the evasions, which are perceived, or suspected to be practiced by some, prompt others to imitation, by the powerful motive of self defence. They infer, that they must follow the example, or be unable to maintain an advantageous competition in the business; an alternative very perplexing to all but men of exact probity, who are thereby rendered in a great measure victims to a principle of legislation, which does not sufficiently accord with the bias of human nature. And thus the laws become sources of discouragement and loss to honest industry, and of profit and advantage to perjury and fraud. It is a truth, that cannot be kept too constantly in view, that all revenue laws, which are so constructed, as to involve a lax and defective execution, are instruments of oppression to the most meritorious part of those, on whom they immediately operate, and of additional burthens, on the community at large.  
The last effect is produced in two ways: The deficiencies in the funds (which, in the main, afford only partial exemptions) must be supplied from other taxes: And the charges of collection, which, in most cases, are nearly the same, whether a tax, or duty yield much or little, occasion an accumulation of the ultimate expence of furnishing a given sum to the Treasury.  
Another, and a very serious evil, chargeable on the system opposite to that proposed, is, that it leads to frequent and familiar violations of oaths; which, by loosening one of the strongest bands of society, and weakening one of the principal securities to life and property, offends not less against the maxims of good government and sound policy, than against those of religion and morality.  
It may not be improper further to remark, that the two great objections to the class of duties, denominated excises, are inapplicable to the plan suggested. These objections are: First The summary jurisdiction confided to the officers of Excise; in derogation from the course of the common law, and the right of trial by jury. And, secondly, the general power vested in the same officers of visiting and searching indiscriminately the houses, stores and other buildings of the dealers in excised articles. But by the plan proposed, the officers to be employed are to be clothed with no such summary jurisdiction, and their discretionary power of visiting and searching is to be restricted to those places, which the Dealers themselves shall designate, by public insignia or marks, as the depositories of the articles, on which the duties are to be laid. Hence, it is one of the recommendations of the plan, that it is not liable to those objections.  
Duties of the kind proposed are not novel in the United States; as has been intimated in another place. They have existed to a considerable extent, under several of the State Governments, particularly in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. In Connecticut, a State exemplary for its attachment to popular principles, not only all ardent spirits, but foreign articles of consumption, generally, have been the subjects of an excise, or inland duty.  
If the supposition, that duties of this kind are attended with greater expence in the collection, than taxes on land, should seem an argument for preferring the latter, it may be observed, that the fact ought not too readily to be taken for granted. The state of things in England is sometimes referred to as an example on this point. But, there, the smallness of the expence, in the collection of the land tax, is to be ascribed to the peculiar modification of it; which proceeding, without new assessments, according to a fixed standard, long since adjusted, totally disregards the comparative value of lands and the variations in their value. The consequence of this is an inequality, so palpable and extreme, as would be likely to be ill relished by the landholders of the United States. If in pursuit of greater equality, accurate periodical valuations, or assessments, are to afford a rule, it may well be doubted, whether the expence of a land tax will not always exceed that of the kind of duties proposed.  
The ingenious, but fallacious hypothesis, that all taxes on consumption fall finally, with accumulated weight, on land, is now too generally and too satisfactorily exploded, to require to be combated here. It has become an acknowleged truth, that in the operation of those taxes, every species of capital and industry contribute their proportion to the revenue; and, consequently, that as far as they can be made substitutes for taxes on lands, they serve to exempt them from an undue share of the public burthen.  
Among other substantial reasons, which recommend, as a provision for the public Debt, duties upon articles of consumption, in preference to taxes on houses and lands, is this: It is very desireable, if practicable, to reserve the latter fund for objects and occasions, which will more immediately interest the sensibility of the whole community, and more directly affect the public safety. It will be a consolatory reflection, that so capital a resource remains untouched, by that provision; which, while it will have a very material influence, in favour of public credit, will be also conducive to the tranquility of the public mind, in respect to external danger, and will really operate as a powerful guarantee of peace. In proportion as the estimation of our resources is exalted in the eyes of foreign nations, the respect for us must increase; and this must beget a proportionable caution neither to insult nor injure us with levity. While on the contrary, the appearance of exhausted resources, (which would perhaps be a consequence of mortgaging the revenue to be derived from land, for the interest of the public debt) might tend to invite both insult and injury, by inspiring an opinion, that our efforts to resent or repel them were little to be dreaded.  
It may not be unworthy of reflection, that while the idea of residuary resources, in so striking a particular, cannot fail to have many beneficial consequences; the suspension of taxes on real estate can as little fail to be pleasing to the mass of the community; and it may reasonably be presumed, that so provident a forbearance on the part of the Government will ensure a more chearful acquiescence on that of the class of the community, immediately to be affected; whenever experience and the exigency of conjunctures shall dictate a resort to that species of revenue.  
But in order to be at liberty to pursue this salutary course, it is indispensable, that an efficacious use should be made of those articles of consumption, which are the most proper and the most productive; to which class distilled spirits very evidently belong: And a prudent energy will be requisite, as well in relation to the mode of collection, as to the quantum of the duty.  
It need scarcely be observed, that the duties on the great mass of imported articles have reached a point, which it would not be expedient to exceed. There is, at least, satisfactory evidence, that they cannot be extended further, without contravening the sense of the body of the Merchants; and though it is not to be admitted, as a general rule, that this circumstance ought to conclude against the expediency of a public measure; yet, when due regard is had to the disposition, which that enlightened class of citizens has manifested towards the National Government, to the alacrity with which they have hitherto seconded its operations, to the accommodating temper, with which they look forward to those additional impositions on the objects of Trade, which are to commence with the ensuing year, and to the greatness of the innovation, which, in this particular, has already taken place, in the former state of things: there will be perceived to exist the most solid reasons against lightly passing the bounds, which coincide with their impressions of what is reasonable and proper. It would be, in every view, inauspicious to give occasion for a supposition, that trade alone is destined to feel the immediate weight of the hand of government, in every new emergency of the Treasury.  
However true, as a general position, that the consumer pays the duty; yet it will not follow, that trade may not be essentially distressed and injured by carrying duties, on importation, to a height, which is disproportioned to the mercantile capital of a country. It may not only be the cause of diverting too large a share of it from the exigencies of business; but as the requisite advances to satisfy the duties will, in many, if not in most cases precede the receipts, from the sale of the articles, on which they are laid, the consequence will often be sacrifices, which the merchant cannot afford to make.  
The inconveniencies of exceeding the proper limit, in this respect, which will be felt every where, will fall with particular severity on those places, which have not the advantage of public banks; and which abound least in pecuniary resources. Appearances do not justify such an estimate of the extent of the mercantile capital of the United States, as to encourage to material accumulations on the, already considerable, rates of the duties, on the mass of foreign importation.  
Another motive for caution, on this point, arises from the reflection, that the effect of an important augmentation, made by a law of the last session, is hitherto a mere matter of speculative calculation, and has not yet even begun to be tried.  
It is presumeable, too, that a still further augmentation would have an influence, the reverse of favourable to the public credit. The operation would be apt to be regarded as artificial, as destitute of solidity, as presenting a numerical increase, but involving an actual diminution of revenue. The distrust of the efficacy of the present provision might also be accompanied with a doubt of a better substitute hereafter. The inference would not be unnatural, that a defect of other means, or an inability to command them, could alone have given birth to so unpromising an effort to draw all from one source.  
A diversification of the nature of the funds is desireable on other accounts. It is clear that less dependence can be placed on one species of funds, and that too liable to the vicissitudes of the continuance, or interruption of foreign intercourse, than upon a variety of different funds formed by the union of internal with external objects.  
The inference, from these various and important considerations, seems to be, that to attempt to extract wholly from duties on imported articles, the sum necessary to a complete provision for the public debt would probably be both deceptive and pernicious, incompatible with the interests, not less of revenue than of commerce: That resources of a different kind must of necessity be explored: And that the selection of the most fit objects is the only thing, which ought to occupy inquiry.  
Besides the establishment of supplementary funds, it is requisite to the support of the public credit, that those established should stand upon a footing which will give all reasonable assurance of their effectual collection.  
Among the articles enumerated in the act making further provision for the payment of the debt of the United States, there are two, Wines and Teas, in regard to which some other regulations, than have yet been adopted, seem necessary for the security of the revenue and desireable for the accommodation of the merchant.  
With these views, it is submitted, that the term for the payment of the duties on wines be enlarged, as it respects Madeira wines, to eighteen months, and as it respects other wines, to nine months; and that they be collected on a plan similar to that proposed in relation to imported distilled spirits.  
And that a third option (two being allowed by the present law) be given to the importers of teas; which shall be, to give bond without surety for the amount of the duty in each case, payable in two years, upon the following terms:  
The teas to be deposited at the expence and risk of the importer in store houses to be agreed upon between him and the proper officer of the revenue; each storehouse having two locks, the key of one of which to be in the custody of the importer, or his agent, and the key of the other of which to be in the custody of an officer, whose duty it shall be made to attend, at all reasonable times, for the purpose of deliveries.  
These deliveries, whether for home sale, or for exportation to a foreign Country, to be warranted by permits from the chief officer of inspection of the place.  
If for home sale, the permits to be granted after the duties shall have been paid, or secured to be paid.  
When the amount of the duties shall not exceed one hundred Dollars, four months to be allowed for payment. When it shall exceed one hundred Dollars, and not exceed five hundred Dollars the term of payment to be eight months; and twelve months whenever the amount shall exceed five hundred Dollars; provided that the credit shall in no case extend beyond the period of two years originally allowed for the intire sum. If the duties on the whole quantity deposited shall not have been paid, or secured to be paid, before the expiration of that time, it shall be lawful for the proper officer to cause a sale to be made of so much as shall be sufficient to discharge what shall remain unsatisfied. In every case, it shall be, at the option of the party applying for the permit, either to pay the amount of the duties on the quantity to be delivered, or to give bond for it, with one or more sureties, to the satisfaction of the officer, whose province it shall be to grant the permits.  
If the deliveries are to be made for exportation, the permits to be granted upon bond being entered into to secure and ascertain the exportation. This may require some alterations of form, in the manner of proceeding, relatively to the exportation of this article.  
All Teas to be landed under the care of the Inspectors of the revenue; the chests and other packages containing them to be marked; and certificates, which shall accompany them, to be granted, as in the case of distilled spirits.  
To these more direct expedients for the support of public credit, the institution of a National Bank presents itself, as a necessary auxiliary. This the Secretary regards as an indispensable engine in the administration of the finances. To present this important object in a more distinct, and more comprehensive light, he has concluded to make it the subject of a separate report, which he begs leave herewith to submit No. II.

That the following additions be made to the duties on spirits  
imported from foreign countries, which are fpecified in the ast

And &#x27;hat the following duties be laid on fp;rits distilled within

of the said sixth class of proof, per gallon, twenty cents.  
  
And upon each still employed in distilling spirits fiom the like  
materials in any other place than a city, town or village, in lieu of  
the rates above mentioned, the yearly sum of sixty cents for every  
gallon English wine measure of the capacity of such still including  
its head ; exempting nevertheless all such stills, wiihin a certain  
defined dimtnfion, as are used essentially for domestic purposes of  
their refpe&amp;ive proprietors.  
  
The produtt of these fcvcral duties (which correspond in their  
rates with those proposed in the report above referred to, of the  
ninth of January lad) may, upon as good grounds as the nature of  
the cafe will admit, prior to an experiment, be computed at eight  
hundred and seventy seven thoufand&#x27;and five hundred dollars ; the  
particulars of which computation are contained in the (latement  
which accompanies this report.  
  
This computed produ6l exceeds the sum which has been stated a«  
neceflary to be provided, by fifty thousand eight hundred and fe­  
ven/y-five dollars, and twenty-seven cents ; an excess, which if it  
(hould be realized by the a&amp;ual product, may be beneficially ap­  
plied towards increasing the finking fund.  
  
The Secretary has been encouraged to renew the proposition of  
these duties, in the fame torm in which they were before submit­

the different di feu (lions of the fubjett, that collateral considerati­

the impracticability which he conceives to exist, of devifingany

munity; and from an opinion that the extension of the plan of

rjTIHL expediency of improving the resource of distilled spirits,  
X as an article of revenne, to the greatcft pia&amp;icable extent,had  
been noticed upon another occasion. Various eonliderations  
might be added to thofr, then acduccd, to evince it. Bur they  
arc too obvious tojuftify the detail. There is fcarceW an attitude  
in which the object can present itlelf, which doe* not invite, by  
all the inducements of found policy and public good, to take a  
strong andeffc&amp;ual hold of it.  
Ti c manner of doing it, or in other voids, the mode of collec­  
tion, appears to be only point about which adiificultyor ques­  
t «&gt;n can anfe. If that suggested be liable to just obie&amp;ions, the  
united information and wildom of the lcgiflative body enlure the  
fubftiturion of a more perftft plan.  
The Secretary, however, begs leave to remark, that there ap­  
pear to him two leading principles; one or the other of which  
lnuft iieicffirilv chara&amp;crize whatever plan may be adoprrd. One  
of them .makes thefecurity of the revenue to depend chiclly on the  
vigilance of the public, officers ; the other rests it, eifentially, on the  
integrity of the individualr, intereftcd to avoid the payment oi it.  
The firl&#x27;t is tbe basis of a plan fiibmittcd by the Secretary ; the  
lad has pervaded most, if not all the systems which have been hi­  
therto pra&amp;ifed upon, in ditiennt parts of the United States. The  
oaths ot the dealers have been almoit the only security tor their  
compliance with the laws.  
It cannot be too much lamented, that these have been found an  
inadequate dependence. But experience has, on every trial, ma­  
mfeftcd them to be such. Taxes or duties, relying for tlu ir col­  
lcttionon that security, wholly, 01 almost wholly, are uniformly  
unpiodu&amp;ivc : And they cannot fail to be unequal, as long as men  
continue to be discriminated by unequal portions of ic6litude.  
The moll confcicntious will pay most; the leuft conscientious,  
least.  
The impulse of intcreft, always fufficicntly great, alts with pe­  
culiar force in matters of this kind in to which a loole  
mode of thinking is too apt to prevail. The want of a h.ibit of  
appreciating proprrly the nature of the public rights, renders thct  
impulse, in such cafcs, too frequently an overmatch for the fenfeof  
obligation; and the cvafions, which are perceived or fufpe&amp;ed to  
be pra&amp;ifed by some, prompt others to imitation, by the power­  
ful motive of lelf-clcfence. They inier, that they mull follow the  
example, or be unable to maintain an advantageous competition  
in the buiinefs; an alternative very perplexing to all bur men of  
exatt probity, who arc thereby rendered in a great frieafurc vic­  
tims to a principle of legislation, which does not fufficientlv ac­  
cord with the bias of human nature. And thus the laws become  
fourees of difeburagement and lofsto honest industry, and of profit  
?nd advantage to perjury and fraud.  
It is a truth that cannot be kept too confhntly in view, that all  
revenue laws, which are so conftru&amp;cd as to involve a lax and dc­  
fe6live execution, are inftrumcnts of oppression to the most meri­  
torious part of thofc on whom thev immediately opcYate, and of  
additional buithcns on the community at large.  
Tlu- 1. ft cftVft is produced in two ways. The deficiencies in  
the funds (which, in the main, aflord only partial exemption*)  
mull be funplied from other taxes: And the charge* ot collc&amp;ion,  
which, m most cases, are nearly the fame, whether a tax or duty  
yield much or little, occasion an accumulation of the ultimate ex­  
pcijce of furnifbing a given turn to the treasury.  
Another, and a fcriouscvil,chargeable on the system oppo­  
fitq to that proposed, is, that it leads to frequent and familiar vio­  
lations of oaths; which by loofeniug one of the strongest binds  
of fotiety, and wcaknim; one of the piincipal fccurities to liteand  
property, offends not less tgainft the maxims of good government  
and lound policy, than those ot religion and morality.  
It may not be impr*&gt;por iurjtlu,r to remark, that the two great  
objettiym to the clafsof duties denominated cxcifcs, are inappli  
cable to the plan fuggeftrd. These obje&amp;ions arc—First, thefum­  
v)ur\ jurifdiiiion confidcd to the officers of cxcife ; in derogation  
from thccouric of the common law, and the right ps trial by jury:  
And Tecondly/the general power vested in the fame ofliccis of w­  
fiting and searching indjeriminateh the houses, stores and other  
buildings of the dealers in exc.iCcd articles. But by the plan pro­  
poled, the officers to be employed arc to be clothed with no fu h  
fumm ryjurifdittion, and their difcreiionary power ot vifitmg and  
inarching it to be reftri&amp;cdto iliofeplaces, which the dealersthem­  
fclvcs thall designate by public inligniacxr marks, as the de polito­  
rics of the articles on which the duties are to be laid. Hcncc it is  
one of the recojnmcn&#x27;dattons of the plan, that it is not liable to thofc  
ohje6tfons.  
Duties cf the kind proposed are not novel in the United States ;  
as has been intimated in another place. They have cxifted to a  
considerable extent, under fevci jl of the state governments, parti­  
cularly in MafTachufetts, Cor.nc&amp;icut and Pcnnfylvania. In Con­  
necticut,! ftatc exemplary for its attachment to popular principles,  
• not only alf ardent spirits, but forcisii articles ot cohfnmption, ge­  
nerally, have been the fubjc£ls of an cxcife, or inland duty.  
If the supposition, that duties of this kind arc attencicd with  
greater cxpence in the collc&amp;ion than taxes on land, should fcem  
an argument for pre feeing the latter, it may be obfcvVed, that the  
fa6l ought not too readily to be taken for granted. The ftatc of  
things in England is fomctimes referx dtoas an example on this  
point. But there thq (malincfs of the expcncc-in the colle&amp;ion of  
the land tax, is to be ascribed to the peculiar modification of it:  
which proceeding without new aflVlTincnts, to a fix d  
standard long fincc adjuflcd, totally disregards the comparative, v?—  
luc of lands and the variations in their value. T1 &#x27; confequcnce  
of this is an inequality, so palpliDlc and extreme, as would be like­  
ly to be ill rclifhrd by the landholders of the United States. If  
in jiuifuitof greater equably, accurate periodical valuations or af­  
fiftmrnts are. to afford a rnlej &gt;it may well be doubted whether the  
exprnce of a land-tax will not*always exceed tha: of the kiud of  
duties piQpofed.  
Th ingenious, but fallacious hypothecs, that all taxes on con­  
fnmption fall with accumulated weight, on,land, is now  
too g. ncrally and too fatisfadorily exploded, 10 require to be  
combated here. It has become an acknowledged truth, that in  
the operation of thoic.uxc s, every fptcies of -copjtal and induftr7  
contribute their proportion to the 1 evenuc ; andt:o&lt;\feqtiently, u&#x27;  
as far is they can be iua.de substitutes for taxes on.lands, ler\ -  
to exempt them from an undue Ihare ot the pulilic burthen *

A MONG other substantial reasons, which recommend, as a  
provision for the public debt, duties upon articles of con­  
f&#x27;jmption, in preference to taxes on fioufcs and lands, is this It is  
vciy dcftrable, if practicable, to refcrve the latter fund for obje&amp;s  
and occasions, which will more immediately intercft the fcnfibili­  
ty of the whole community, and more dire&amp;ly afFett the public  
fafety. It will be a consolatory reflexion, that so capital a resource  
remains untouched by that provilion, which, while it wiii have a  
very material influence in favor of public credit, will be also con­  
ducive to the tranquility of the public mind in refpeffc to external  
danger, and will really operate as a powerful guarantee of peace.  
In proportion as the e&#x27;ftimation of our resources is exalted in the  
eyes of foreign nations, the refpeft for us must encreafe ; and this  
must beget a proportionable caution neither to insult nor injure  
us with levity. While on the contrary* theappcarance of exhauft­  
cd resources (which would perhaps be a confeqitence of mortga­  
ging the revenneto be derived from land, tor the intercft of the  
public debt) might tend to invite both insult and injury, by in­  
spiring an opinion, that our efforts to resent or repel them were  
little to be dreaded.  
It may not be unworthy of reflc&amp;ion, that while the idea of re­  
siduary resources, in so striking a particular, cannot fail to have  
many bcneficial consequences ; the suspension of taxes on real  
estates can as little fail to be pleafirtg t6 the mass of the communi­  
ty ; and it may reasonably be prefumcd, that so provident a for­  
bearance on the part of the government will ensure a more cheer­  
ful acquiescence on that part of the class of the community imme­  
diately to be affe&amp;cd, whenever experience and the exigency of  
conjun&amp;urcs shall difiate a resort to that species of revenue.  
But in order to be at liberty to pursue i his (alutary course. it is  
indifpenlable that an efficacious use should be made of thofc arti­  
cles of confomption, which are the most proper and the mod pro­  
du6live ; to which class distilled spirits very evidently belong ;  
and a prudent energy will be requisite, as well in relation to the  
mode of collection, as to the quantum of the duty.  
It need scarcely be observed, that the duties on the great mass  
of imported articles, have reached a point, which it would not be  
expedient to exceed. There is, at lead, fatislaftory evidence, that  
they cannot fre extended farther, without contravening the sense of  
the&#x27;body of the merchants ; and though it is not to be admitted  
as a general rule, that this circumftanee ought to conclude against  
the expediency of a public measure; yet when due regard is had  
to thedifpofition which that enlightened class of citizens has man­  
ifefted towards the national government—to the alacrity with  
which they have hitherto seconded its operations—to the accom­  
modating tamper with which they look forward to those addition­  
al impositions on the objetls of trade, which are to corhmence  
with theenfuing year, and tothe greatnefsof the innovation, which  
in this particular, has already taken plactf in the former state of  
things, there will beperceivcd to exist the most solid reasons again ft  
lightly palling the bounds which coincide with their impreflions  
of what is reasonable and proper. It would be, in every view,  
inauspicious to give occasion for a fuppofitionj that trade alone is  
destined to feel the immediate weight of the hand of government,  
in every new emergency of the treasury. •  
However tnie, as a general portion, that the consumer pays the  
duty, yet it will not follow, that trade miy not be effenrially dif­  
trefled and injured, by cairymg duties on importation to a height  
which is difproportioned tothe mercantile capital of a country.  
It may not only be the cause of diverting too large a share oi it  
from the exigencies of business, but as the requisite advances to Sa­  
tisfy the duties will, in many, if not in molt, cases, precede the  
receipts, from the sale the articles on which they are laid, the  
consequence will oken be facrifices which the merchant cannot  
afford to make.  
  
The inconvenience of exceeding the proper limit, in this refpeft,  
which will be felt everv where, will fall with particular severity  
on those places which havf not the advantage of public banks,  
?nd which abound least in pecuniary resources. Appearances do  
not juftify l&#x27;uch an estimate of the extent ot the mercantile capital  
of the United States, as to encourage to material accumulations &lt;-?i  
the, already considerable, rates of tile duties on the mafsof foreign  
importation.  
Another motive for caution on this point, aiiCs from the re­  
flexion, that the effect of an important augmentation made by law  
of the lall session, is hitherto a mere matter of speculative calcula­  
tion, and has not yet even begun to be tried.  
It is presumable too, that a flill further augmentation would  
have an influence, the r-everfe of favorable to the oublic credit.  
The operation would be apt to be regarded as artificial —as defti­  
tutc of fohdity —as prefeming a nurricrical increase, but involving  
an actual diminution of revenue. The distrust of the efficacy of  
the present provision might also be accompanied with a doubt of  
a better substitute hereafter. The inference would not be unna­  
tural, that a defect of other means, or an inability to command  
them, could alone have given birth to so unpromising an effort to  
draw all from one source.  
  
A divcrfification of the nature of the funds is desirable on other  
accounts. It is clear that less dependence can be placed on one  
fpccies of funds, and that too liable to the vicissitudes of the con­  
tinuance, or interruption of foreign intercourse, than upon a vari­  
ety of different funds formed by the union of internal with exter­  
nal objects.  
The inference, from these various and important considerations,  
seems to be, that to attempt to extroft wholly from duties on im­  
ported articles, the sum necefiary to a complete provision for the  
public debt, would probably be both deceptive and pernicious ;  
incompatible with the inferefts, tvot less of revenue than of com­  
merce ; that resources of a differenrkind mull of ncccfuty be ex­  
plored ; and that the feledtion of the mod fit objects is the only  
thing which ought to occupy enquiry.  
Sefidcs the establishment of fupplemcntary funds, it is requisite  
to the support of the public credit, that those eftablifhrd should  
stand upon a footing which will give all reasonable afTurance of  
their effectual collection.  
  
Among the articles enumerated in the ast makingjjprt&#x27;ier provi-  
Jionjor the payment of the debt of the United States, there are two,  
wines and teas, in legard to which some other regulations than  
haveyet been adopted, Teem necessary for the security of the reve­  
nue. and defirablefor the accommodation of the merchant.  
  
With these views, it is submitted, that the term for the payment of  
the duties on wines be enlarged, as it refpecls Madeira wines, to  
eighteen rnomhs ; and as it refpe&amp;s other wines, to nine months ;  
and that they be colle&amp;ed on a plan fimilarto thatpropofed in re­  
lation to imported diftilied spirits.—  
And that a third option (two being allowed by the prcfent law)  
be given to the importers of teas; which fliall be, to give bond  
without surety for the amount of the duty in each cafe, payable in  
two years, upon the following terms—  
The teas to be deposited at the expence and risk of the importer  
in flore-houfes to be agreed upon between him and the proper  
officer of the revenue ; each store-house having two locks, the key  
of one of which to be in the custody of the importer or his ag. iv,  
and the key of the other of which to be in the cultody of an cHB-

If for home sale, ne permits to be granted after the out

merchants; and though it is not to b(  
jdmitted as a general rule, that this cir  
ttumftance ought to conclude against thf  
expediency of a public mealure ; yet  
when due regard is had to the difpofi  
ion which that enlightened class of ci  
izens has manifefted towards the na  
ional government—to the alacrity witl  
which they have hitherto fcconded it:

jer with which they look lorward tc  
hose additional impolit ion son theobjeft  
&gt;f trade, which arc to commence witl

he innovation which, in this particular  
las already taken place in the forme  
of things; there will be perceivec  
0 exist the inoft solid rcai&#x27;ons again!  
ightly passing the bounds which coin  
;ide with their imprellions of what i  
eafonable and proper. It would be  
in every view, inaulpicious to give oc  
cafion lor a luppofition, that trade aloru  
is destined to feel tlie immediate weigh  
jf the hand of government, in every new  
emergency of the treasury.  
&quot; Admitting the general position  
.hat the consumer pays the duty ; yet i  
will not follow that trade may not b&lt;  
jffentiaily dillrefl&#x27;cd and injured by car  
rying duties on importation to a heigh  
which is difproportioned to the mercan  
:ilc capital of a country. It may no  
anly be the cause of diverting too large  
1 share of it from the exigencies of buli  
ness ; but as the requisite advances tc  
atisfy the duties will, in many, if not n  
noft cases, precede the receipts froir  
the sale of the articles on which they arc  
aid, the consequence will often be fa  
rifices which the merchant cannot as  
ford to make.  
1; Appearances do not juftify such ar  
:ftimate of the extent of the mercantile  
capital of the United States, as to encou  
rage material accumulations on the al  
1 eady considerable rates of the duties cr  
the mass of foreign importation.  
&quot; It is presumable, that a dill furthei  
augmentation would have an influence  
the reverie of favourable to the public

credit. The operation would be apt to  
be regarded as artificial, as destitute of  
solidity, as prel&#x27;enting a numerical in­  
crease ; but involving an attual diminu­  
tion of revenue. The diftrufl of the ef­  
ficacy of the present provision might al­  
io be accompanied with a doubt of a bet­  
er substitute hereafter.&#x27; The infer­  
:nce would not be unnatural that a de­  
left of other means, or an inability to  
rommand them, could alone have given  
jirth to so unpromising an effo: t to drav/  
ill from one iotirce.  
&quot; A diverfification of the nature of  
the funds is desirable on other accounts.  
It is clear that less dependence can be  
placed on one fpeciesot funds (and that  
oo liable to the vicissitudes of the con­  
inuance or interruption of foreign in­  
:ercourfe) than upon a variety of differ­  
ent funds formed by the union of inter­  
lal with external objects.  
&quot; The inference, from thefc various  
ind important confederations fcems to  
le, that to attempt to extract from du­  
:ies on imported articles, the sum necef­  
ary to a complete proviiion for the pub­  
ic debt, would probably be both decep­  
;ive and pernicious; incompatible with  
he interests not less of revenue than of  
rommerce ; that resources of a differ­  
ent kind must of neceflity be explored ;  
ind that the felc&amp;ion of the most fit ob­  
e£ts is the only thing which ought to  
accupy enquiry.  
&quot; Besides the establishment of supple­  
mentary funds, it is requilite to the sup­  
port of the public credit, that those efta­  
alifhed should stand upon a footing  
which will give all reasonable alTurancc  
as their effe&amp;ual collection.

ilton, ‘‘ are not novel in the United States, as has been  
intimated in another place. They have existed to a  
considerable extent under several of the state govern-  
ments, particularly in Massachusetts, Connecticut and  
Pennsylvania. In Connecticut, a state exemplary for  
its attachment to popular principles, not only all ardent  
spirits, but foreign articles of consumption generally  
have been the subject of an excise or inland duty.”  
  
In support of this, however, he remarks that there  
appear to him two leading principles, one or the other  
of which must necessarily characterize whatever plan  
may be adopted. One of them makes the security of the  
revenue to depend chiefly on the vigilance of the public offi-  
cers; the other rests it essentially on the integrity of the  
individuals interested to avoid payment of it. The first is  
the basis of the plan submitted by the Secretary ; the last  
has pervaded most, if not all, the systems which have  
hitherto been practiced upon in different parts of the  
United States. The oaths of the dealers have been almost  
the only security for their compliance with the laws. It  
cannot be too much lamented that these have been  
found an inadequate dependence. But experience has,  
on every trial, manifested them to be such. Taxes or  
duties relying for their collection on that security  
wholly, or almost wholly, are uniformly unproductive.  
And they cannot fail to be unequal as long as men con-  
tinue to be discriminated by unequal portions of recti-  
tude. The most conscientious will pay most ; the least  
conscientious least. It isa truth that cannot be kept  
  
too constantly in view, that all revenue laws which are  
so constructed as to involve a lax and defective execu-  
tion, are instruments of oppression to the most merito-  
rious part of those on whom they immediately operate,  
and of additional burdens on the community at large.
