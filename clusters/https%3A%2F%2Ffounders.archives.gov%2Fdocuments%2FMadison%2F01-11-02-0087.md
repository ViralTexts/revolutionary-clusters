? The constitution does not say that a standing army shall be called out to execute the laws. Is not this a more proper way? The militia ought to be called forth to suppress smugglers. Will this be denied? The case actually happened at Alexandria. There were a number of smugglers, who were too formidable for the civil power to overcome. The militia quelled the sailors, who, otherwise, would have perpetrated their intentions. Should a number of smugglers have a number of ships, the militia ought to be called forth to quell them. We do not know but what there may be combinations of smugglers in Virginia hereafter. We all know the use made of the Isle of Man. It was a general depositary of contraband goods.

nts so ignominious as have been inflicted already. The militia law of every state to the north of Maryland, is less rigorous than the particular law of this state. If a change be necessary to be made by the general government, it will be in our favor. I think that the people of those states would not agree to be subjected to a more harsh punishment than their own militia laws inflict. An observation fell from a gentleman, on the same side with myself, which deserves to be attended to. If we be dissatisfied with the national government—if we should choose to renounce it, this is an additional safe-guard to our defence. I conceive that we are peculiarly interested in giving the general government as extensive means as possible to protect us.

What is the intent, it was asked, of the power to call forth the militia  
to execute the laws of the United States? Isa military government aimed  
at? The answer was, the meaning is plain—if the civil power be insuffi-  
cient. Why not say so? was the rejoinder; we are all agreed upon that  
point, and, when the expression of a purpose is so easy, why leave a loop-  
hole for construction? On the face of the instrument there is nothing to  
exclude the danger of a future claim that the words mean exactly what they  
say, and no more. Madison answered by recalling “a remark which had  
fallen from a gentleman on the same side as himself, and which deserved to  
be attended to. If we be dissatisfied with this national government, and  
choose to renounce it, this is an additional safeguard to our defense.”  
  
Great objection was made to the exclusive jurisdiction over the ten  
miles square. Madison thought he had obviated it, by the suggestion that  
the Federal Government could not otherwise be guarded from the undue  
influence of some State, or be safe in its deliberations, and secure from  
insult. He pointed out that there must be a cession of the land by
