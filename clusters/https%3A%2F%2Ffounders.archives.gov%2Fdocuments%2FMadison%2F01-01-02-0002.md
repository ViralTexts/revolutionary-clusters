A Vine was rescued by the Almighty’s hand  
From Egypt’s wast[e] &amp; Placed in Canaan’s Land:  
Fenced round by Heaven, the fruitful Branches grew,  
Blessed the warm Sun, &amp; drunk th’ enliv’ning Dew:  
But now the Trampling Bull &amp; hungry Boar,  
Wild from the Woods, the lovely Tree devour.  
Fence, Clusters, Boughs, one general ruin share,

Look, gracious Heaven! on this thy mourning Vine,

A Metonymy will for kindred sake  
The name of one thing for another take.

Effect the cause denote:—Pale Death destroys  
Gay giddy Youth, &amp; withers all its Joys.  
Subjects for Adjuncts stand:—Friends, take the Cup,  
And, thankful for its blessings, drink it up.

Eager we drank, and quenched our raging Flames.  
A Part denotes the Whole:—’Twas Marlborough  
At Blenheim fought, &amp; crushed the Gallic Foe.  
Generals for Specials stand:—New Life proclaim

Specials a General mean: The East Wind raves,  
And heave[s] th’ Atlantic in ten thousand Waves.  
  
  
An Irony in soft mellifluent Phrase

On Orpheus, written by Antipater  
  
  
No longer, Orpheus, shall thy sacred strains  
Lead Stones, and Trees, and Beasts along the Plains;  
No longer sooth the boisterous winds to sleep,  
Or still the Billows of the raging Deep.  
For thou art gone, the Muses mourn’d thy Fall  
In solemn strains, thy Mother most of All.  
Ye Mortals, idly for your Son, ye moan  
If they a Goddess could not save her own.

Still in our ears Andromache complains,  
And still in sight the fate of Troy remains:  
Still Ajax fights, still Hector’s dragg’d along,  
Such strange Inchantment dwells in Homer’s Song;  
Whose Birth could more than one poor Realm adorn,  
For all the world is proud that he was born.

Divine Euripides, This Tomb we see  
So fair, is not a Monument for thee.  
So much as thou for it, since all will own

Winde, Gentle Ever-green, to form a Shade  
Around the Tomb where Sophocles is laid.  
Sweet Ivy winde thy Boughs, and Intertwine  
With Blushing Roses and the clustring Vine.  
Thus will thy lasting leaves, with Beauty hung,  
Prove gratefull Emblems of the lays he sung;  
Whose Soul, excelled like a God of wit  
Among the Muses and the Graces writ.

The very Bees, O sweet Menander hung  
To taste the Muses spring upon thy Tongue  
The very Graces made the Scenes you writ  
  
Their happy point of fine expression hit.  
Thus still you live, you make your Athens shine,  
And raise it’s Glory to the Skies in thine.
