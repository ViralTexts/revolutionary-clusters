Quincy December 26th. 1808.  
  
I receive very kindly your obliging letter of the 15th. of this month. Ever since my return from Europe, where I had resided ten years and could not be fully informed of the state of affairs in my own Country, I have been constantly anxious and alarmed at the intemperance of party spirit and the unbounded license of our presses. In the same view I could not but lament some things, which have lately passed in public bodies. To instance, at Dedham and Topsfield; and last of all in the Resolutions of our Massachusetts Legislature. Upon principle, I see no right in our Senate and House to dictate, nor to advise, or to request our Represenatives in Congress. The right of the people to instruct their Representatives is very dear to them and will never be disputed by me. But this is a very different thing from an interference of a State legislature. Congress must be the “Cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night,” to conduct this Nation, and if their eyes are to be diverted by wandering light, accidentally springing up, in every direction, we shall never get through the Wilderness.  
I have not been inattentive to the course of our publick affairs, and agree with Congress in their Resolutions to resist the decrees, edicts and orders of France and England; but I think the king’s proclamation for the impressment of Seamen on board our Merchantships has not been distinctly enough notified reprobated. It is the most groundless pretension of all. Retired as I am, conversing with very few of any party; out of the secret of affairs; collecting information only from publick papers and pamphlets, many links in the great chain of deliberations, actions and events, may have escaped me. You will easily believe, that an excessive diffidence in my own opinions, has not been the sin, that has most easily beset me. I must nevertheless confess to you that in all the intricate combinations of our affairs, to which I have ever been a witness, I never found myself so much at a loss to form a judgment of what the Nation ought to do, or what part I ought to act. No man then, I hope, will have more confidence in the solidity of any thing I may suggest, than I have myself.  
I revere the upright and enlightened general sense of our American Nation. It is nevertheless capable, like all other Nations of general prejudices and National errors. Among these, I know not whether there is any more remarkable than that opinion so universal, that it is in our power to bring foreign nations to our terms, by with-holding our Commerce. When the Executive and Legislative authority of any Nation, especially in the old Governments and great powers of Europe, have adopted measures upon deliberation and published them to the World, they cannot recede, without a deep humiliation and disgrace, in the eyes of their own Subjects, as well as all Europe. They will therefore obstinately adhere to them at the expence even of great sacrifices and in defiance of great dangers. In 1774 Congress appeared almost unanimously sanguine, that a non-importation and a non-consumption association would procure an immediate repeal of acts of parliament and Royal orders. I went heartily along with the rest in all these measures, because I knew that the sense of the Nation, the publick opinion in all the Colonies required them, and I did not see that they could do harm. But I had no confidence in their success in any thing but uniting the American people. I expressed this opinion freely to some of my friends, particular to Mr. Henry of Virginia, and to Major Hawley of Massachusetts. These two and these only agreed with me in opinion, that we must fight, after all. We found by experience, that a war of eight years in addition to all our Resolutions was necessary, and the aid of France Spain and Holland too, before our purposes could be accomplished. Do we presume that we can excite insurrection, rebellion and a Revolution in England? Even a Revolution would be no benefit to us. A Republican government in England would be more hostile to us than the government Monarchy is. The resources of that country are so great; their Merchants, Capitalists and principal manufacturers are so rich, that they can employ their Manufacturers and Store their productions for a long time, perhaps longer than we can or will bear to hoard ours. In 1794 upon these principles and for these reasons I thought it my duty to decide in Senate, against Mr Madison’s resolutions, as they were called, and I have seen no reason to alter my opinion since. I own I was sorry when the late non-importation law passed. When a war with England was seriously apprehended in 1794, I approved of an Embargo, as a temporary measure to preserve our Seamen and property, but not with any expectation that it would influence England. I thought the Embargo, which was laid a year ago, a wise and prudent measure for the same reason; viz to preserve our Seamen and as much of our property as we could get in, but not with the faintest hope, that it would influence the British Councils. At the same time I confidently expected that it would be raised in a few months. I have not censured any of these measures because I knew the fond attachment of the Nation to them; but I think the Nation must soon be convinced that they will not answer their expectations. The Embargo and the Non-intercourse laws I think ought not to last long. They will lay such a foundation of disaffection to the National Government as will give great uneasiness to Mr. Jefferson’s Successor and produce such distractions and confusions as I shudder to think of. The Naval and Military force to carry them into execution would maintain a war. Are you then for war, you will ask? I will answer you candidly I think a war would be a less evil than a rigorous enforcement of the Embargo and Non-intercourse. But we have no necessity to declare war against England or France, or both. We may raise the Embargo, repeal the non-intercourse, authorize our Merchants to arm their Vessells, give them special letters of Mark to defend themselves against all unlawful aggressors, and take burn or destroy all vessels or make prize of them as Enemies that shall attack them. In the mean time apply all our resources to build frigates, some in ever principal Seaport. These frigates ought not to be assembled in any one port to become an object of a hostile expedition to destroy them. They should be separated and scattered as much as possible from New Orleans to Passamaquoddy. I never was fond of the plan of building Line of battle-ships. Our policy is not to fight Squadron’s at Sea, but to have fast sailing Frigates to scour the Seas and make impression on the Enemies’ Commerce; and in this way we can do great things. Our great Sea ports and most exposed frontier places ought not to be neglected in their fortifications; but I cannot see for what purpose an hundred thousand Militia are called out, nor why we should have so large an army at present. The Revenues applied to these Uses would be better appropriated to building Frigates. We may depend upon it we shall never be respected by foreign powers until they see that we are sensible of the great resources which the Almighty in his benevolent providence has put into our hands. No Nation under the sun has better materials, architects or Mariners for a respectable Maritime power. I have no doubt but our people, when they see a necessity will cheerfully pay the taxes necessary for their defence and to support their Union, Independence and National honour. When our Merchants are armed if they are taken they cannot blame the Government; if they fight well and captivate their enemies they will acquire glory and encouragement at home, and England or France may determine for themselves whether they will declare war. I believe neither will do it, because each will be afraid of our joining the other. If either should, in my opinion the other will rescind; but if we should have both to fight, it would not be long before one or the other would be willing to make peace and I see not much difference between fighting both and fighting England alone. My heart is with the Spanish Patriots and I should be glad to assist them as far as our Commerce can supply them. I conclude with acknowledging that we have received greater injuries from England than from France, abominable as both have been. I conclude that whatever the Government determines I shall support as far as my small voice extends.  
I am Sir with respect and esteem Your humble Servt.

R.  
Quinct, 26th Dec. 1808.  
i ^ RECEIV E very kindly y«ur obliging  
letter of the lSLliof this month. Ever since  
rny return from Europe, where I had resi  
ded ten years, and could not be fully inform­  
ed of the state of affairs, in my own conn­  
ti), I have been constantly anxious and a­  
larmed at the intemperance of party spi­  
tit, and the unbounded license ot our pres­  
ses. In the same view, I could not but la­  
ment some things,,which have lately pas.  
sew in public bodies. To instance, at Ucd­  
l.am and Topsfield,* and lust of all in the  
Resolutions ot our Massachusetts Legisla­  
tii! t. Upon principle, I see no right in our  
Senate and I louse to dictate, or advise or  
to request our Representatives in Congress.  
1 ne right of the people to instruct their  
representatives is very dear to them, and  
will never be disputed by me. Hut this is  
a very different thing from an interference  
of a state Legislature. Congrn,;; must be

I have not been inattentive to the course  
of our public affairs, and agree with Con­  
gress in their resolutions to resist the ])c­

then I hope, will have mure confidence in  
the solidity of ant thing I may suggest, than  
I have myself.  
I revere the upright and enlightened gene­  
ral sense of our American Nation. It is ne­  
vertheless capable, like all other nations, of  
general prejudices and national errors. A  
mongthese Ikimw not whether there is any  
more rcinurkublc than that opinion, so uni &#x27;

“• «&gt;.y Nation, especial I v in j  
the old governm&#x27;-fitsand great powers of liu- |

cannot recede, Without a deep humiliation I  
ami disgrace, in the eyes of their own sub- |  
jeets, as we ll as all Europe. Thev will I  
therefore obstinately adhere to them, at the \
expence even ol great sacrilices. anil in deli- !  
ante of great dangers. In 1774. Congress j  
appeared almost unanimously sanguine, that j  
a non-importation and non-consumption as- j  
socialion, would procure an immediate rc- !  
peal of Acts of Parliament &amp; Royal Orders.

sense of the nation, the public opinion in all  
the colonies required them—and I did not see  
that they could do harm. But I had no con -  
hdence in their success, in any thing but  
uniting the American /icofilc. i expressed  
this opinion freelyto some of my friends, par­  
ticularly to Mr. henry, of Virginia, and to  
Major Hawley, of Massachusetts. These  
two, and these only, agreed with me in opi­  
nion, that we must light after all. We found  
by experience, that a war of right yearn,  
in addition to all our Hesolutiotin, was neces­  
sary—and the aid of Fi ance, Spain and Hol­  
land too, before our purposes could lie accom -  
plished. Do we presume that we can excite  
Insurrection, Rebellion and a Revolution in  
  
r.ngiunci r luven a Revolution wuuld be no  
benefit to us. A Republican government in  
England would be more hostile to us than  
the Monarchy is. The resources of that coun­  
ty are so great: their Merchants,Capitalists  
ccprincipal Manufacturers are so rich that  
they can employ their manufacturers 2c store  
their productions tor a long time, perhaps  
longer than we can or will bear to hoard ours.  
In 1794 upon these principles, and for these  
reasons, I thought it my duty to decide in se­  
nate against Mr. Madison’s Resolutions, as  
they were culled, &amp; I huve seen uoreuson to  
alter my opinion since f I own, I was sorry  
when the late nonimportation law passed.—  
When a war with England was seriously ap­  
prehended in 1794, I approved of an Embar­  
go as a temporary measure to preserve our  
seamen and property; but not with any ex­  
pectation that it would influence England. I  
thought the embargo which was laid a year­  
ago, a wise and prudent measure, for the  
same i eason, viz. to preserve our seamen &amp;  
as much of our property as we could get in ;  
but not with the faintest hope that it would  
influence the British councils. At the same  
time, I confidently expected, that it would  
be raised in a few months. I have not cen­  
sured any of these measures, because I knew  
the fond attachment of the nation to them ;  
i’it I think the nut ion must soon be convinced  
that they will not answer their expectations.  
1 he Embargo and the Non-Importation laws  
I tlunk ought not to last long. They will  
lay such a foundation of disaffection to the  
National Government as wi/1 give great un­  
easiness to Mr Jefferson&#x27;s successor, and  
will produce such distractions and confusi­  
ons as I shudder to think of. The naval Sc  
military force to carry them into execution  
would maintain a war. Are you then for war,  
ask? I will answer you candidly •  
1 think a war would be a less evil than a rigo­  
rous enforcement of the embargo and aNnn­  
intercourse- But we have no necessity to de­  
clare war against England or France or both.  
\Ve may raise the Embargo, repeal the non­  
importation, authorize our merchants to arm  
their vessels; give them special Letters of  
Marque to defend themselves against all uu  
lawful aggressors ; and take, burn or destroy  
all vessels, or make prize of them, as Ene­  
mies, that shall attack them. In the mean  
time, apply all our resources to build frigates;  
some in every principal sea port. These fri­  
gates ought not to be assembled in any one  
port, to become an object of a hostile expe­  
dition to destroy them. They should he se­  
parated and scattered as much as possible,  
from New Orleans to Passaniaqnoddy. I  
ne\ ei was fond of the plan of building line or  
battle ships. Our policy is not to fight squa­  
drolls at sea; but to have fast sailjng fri­  
gates, to scour the seas, and make impresri­  
ops or. the enemies&#x27; commerce; and in this  
way we can no great things. Our great sea  
ports and most exposed frontier places ought  
not to be neglected in their fortifications;  
but I cannot see for what purpose an hun­  
dred thousand militia are called out, nor why  
we should have so large an army at present.  
I he Revenues applied to these uses would  
be better appropriated tobuilding frigates_  
VVc may depend upon it, we shall never be  
respected by Foreign powers, until they see  
that we arc sensible of the great resource  
w hich the Almighty, in his benevolent Pro­  
vidence, has put into our hands. No nation  
under the sun has better materials, archi­  
tects, or mariners for a respectable maritime  
power. I have no doubt our people, when they  
see a necessity, will cheerfully pay the taxes  
necessary for their defence, and&#x27;to support  
their l nion. Independence, and National ho­  
noi-.—When our merchants are armed, if  
they are taken, they cannot blame the go­  
  
vn nmenc. it they light well and capture  
[ their enemies they will acquire glory and en­  
I couragemeut at home ; &amp;. England or France  
may determine for themselves whether they  
will declare war. I believe neither will do it,  
jbecause each will be afraid of our joining  
the other. It either should, in my opinion,  
the other will rescind ; but if we should have  
hnth to fight, it would not be long before one  
or the other would lie willing to make peace ;  
and 1 see not much difference between fight­  
ing both anti fighting England alone.  
Al v heart is with the Spanish Patriots, and !

these meﬁ, because I knew the fond ate  
tachment of che nation to them ; but I think  
the nation mayst: soon be convinced that they  
will not answer theirexpectations. The Em­  
bargo and ‘the non-ifaportation Jaws, T think  
onght not.to last kwg They will lay such a  
foundation of disaffeetion to the national gov­

- 1 wilbanswer you candidly : I think a war  
would be a legs evil than a rigovous - enforce­  
ment of the embgero. and a nonsiitercourse.  
Dutwe have no ficoessity 1o declare war a­  
gainst England or France, or both, We may  
raise the embarge, repeal the non-importas  
tion, authorise our merchagls o arn their  
vessels ¢ give them special Letters of Mar­  
que o defend themsclves aganst all ulaw­  
tul aggressors 3 and take, burn or d2stroy all  
vesgels, or make prizeof them, as enemies,  
that shall attack thewm. In the mean time  
apply all our resources to build frigates ;  
some in every principal sea-port. These fri­  
gates ought not to be assembled in any one  
rt, to become an object of a hostile expe­  
g;)tion to destroy them. They should be se­  
parated and scattered as ‘much as possible,  
from New-Orleans to Passamaqueddy. Ine­  
ver was fond of the plan of building line of  
battle ships. Our policy is not to fight squad­  
rons at sea ; but to have fast sailing frigates  
%o scour the seas ; and make imprestions on -  
&amp; iBy’s commoree ; and in t &quot;.W we  
~ meglected in theit fortification *ﬁ 1 cannot  
see for what purpose an hundred thousand  
militia are called outy, nor why we should  
have so&#x27;large an army at present.. The reve­  
nues applied te these uses would be bettepap­  
propriated to building Frigatess We may de­  
pend-upon it, we shall never be respected by  
Loreign powers, until they see tggt-w.cg: sen-.  
sible of the preat resources which the Al­  
mighty in his benevolent Providénce, has  
pu&amp;imo our hands., No nation under the sun  
has better materials, architects, or mariners,  
for a respectuble maritime power-—I have  
no doubt our people, when they sec a neces­  
sity, will elicerfully pay the taxes necessary  
for theit deéfence and o support their Union,  
lndependonce, and National Honour, When  
our merchants are armed, if they ave taken,  
they canuot blame the government. 1f they  
fight well, und capture théir cuemics, they  
will acquire glory and enconragement at  
home, and Eogland or France may deter­  
mine for themscives whether they will de­  
clare war. Ibclieve neither will do it, be­  
cause each will be afraid of our joining the  
other. M either shouldgin my opingt, the  
other will #scind ; but if we shuu{ﬁ have  
both o fight, it would not be long hefore one  
orthéother would be willing to make peace ;.  
and T see nat milich differende between fight­  
ing both, and fighting kogland alone.  
My hearl is with the Spoanish Patidots, and  
I shoud be glad to assist them as far as our  
commerce cun supply them. I conclude  
with acknowledging that we have veqci?cd  
greater, injuvice from England than from  
Francey übominabls as both have been. What­

Quincy, 26th December,li08,  
Stn, , : v.-v: ......  
&#x27; - I RECEIVE very kindly your oblising  
letter, of the 1 5lh of this month. Ever since  
  
my return from Europe, where I had resided  
ten years, and could not be fully informed of  
the state of affairs, in my Orvn country, I  
have been constantly anxious and alarmed at  
the intemperance of party spirit, and , the un­  
bounded license of our presses. In the same  
view, I couM not. but lament some things,  
which have lately passed in public bodies.  
To instance, at Dedhamlatid Topsfield, and  
last of all in the Resolutions of our Mdssachu  
setts Legislature. Upon principle,. I see. no  
rijht in our Senate and House to dictate, or  
advis, or to request our Representatives in  
Congress. The right of the people to instruct  
  
itjetr representatives is very oear to tnem,  
and will never be disputed by me. But this is  
a very different tiling from an interference of  
a State Legislature. Congress must be the  
&quot; cloud by diy and ihe fiillar offire by niglt,&quot;  
to conduct thisnatiov ; and if tieir eyes are to  
be diverted by loindermg light accidm&#x27;ly  
springing Hp in every direction, vteshall never  
?get through the wilderness, . &quot;  
  
I have not been inattentive-to the course of  
  
our public affairs, and agree with congress in  
their resolutions to resist the decrees, edicts  
  
and orders ot f ranee and iLngiand ; but I  
think the King&#x27;s proclamation for the impress­  
ment of seamen on board our merchant shifts,  
has riot been distinctly enough reprobated.  
  
It is&#x27; the most groundless pretension of all.  
  
Retired asl am, conversing with very lew of  
  
any party ) out ot the secret of affairs : col  
  
lecting information only from public papers  
  
and pamphlets, many Jinks in their great  
  
chain ot denoerations, actions and events,  
  
may have escaped me- You will easily be  
  
lieve, that an excessive diffidence in my own  
i . t it . i . i  
  
opinions nas noi oeeu me sin, mat nas  
most easily beset me.&#x27;&#x27; 1 must nevertheless  
  
onfessto you, that in all the intricate combi  
  
nations ot our an Airs, 10 which l nave ever  
been a witness, 1 never loud myself so much  
at a loss to form a judgement of what the  
  
ration ought to do, or what part I aught to  
  
act. No man, then. 1 hope, will have  
  
more confidence in thesolidity of any thing  
  
I may suggest, than I have myself.  
I revere the upright and enlightened gene  
  
ral sense ot our vmertcar. nation, ic is ne  
  
vertheless capable, like all other nations, of  
  
general prejudices and national errors. A­  
mone these L know not whether there is anv  
  
more remarkable than that opinion, so&#x27; uni­  
ersal, that it is in our power to bring foreign  
nations to our terms, withholdiug ourcommerce.-  
When the executive and legislative  
authority of any nation, especially in the old  
governments and greafc powers of Europe,  
have abopted measures, upon deliberation,  
iinri nnhlisheri them to the wnrlrL thpv rum.iif  
  
recede, without a deep humiliation&#x27;and dis­  
grace, in the eyes of their own cuVjects, as  
well as all Europe. They will therefore ob­  
stinately adhere to. them, at the expense even  
of great sacrific&#x27;esfcJand in defiance of great  
dangers. In 1774, congress appeared almost  
unanimously sanguine, that a nun-importation  
and non-consumption .association would pro­  
cure an immediate repeal of acts of parlia­  
ruent and royal orders. I went heartily along  
  
with the rest m all these measures, because 1  
knew, that the sense of the nation, the public  
opinion in aH the colonics required them ; a. id  
1 did not see that they could do harm. But  
1 had no confidence in their success, in  
any thing, but uniting the American fieofile. 1  
expressed this ( pinion freely&quot;&#x27; to some of my  
friends, particularly to Mr. Henry, of Virgi-  
i ... tn:&#x27;iy . .... ,.r vt i ... &#x27;  
  
These two, and these&quot; pn I yV agreed with me  
in opinion, that we must fight after all.&#x27; We  
found by experiencethat a war &quot;of eight years,  
in addition to all our resolutions, was necessa­  
ry ; tid the aid of Erfice, Spain, andHol-land-too,  
before our purpose could be accom­  
plished.&#x27; Do we presume that we can excite  
-insurrection, rebellion, and a revolution in  
England ? Even a revolution wcuid be no be­  
nefit to. us.&#x27; A republican government in  
England would be move hostile to us than thc  
monarchy is. The resources of that country  
are so great; their merchants, capitalists,  
  
. in hii i,u iiwnuuLvui tusrc su ncn, uiaiuiey  
can employ their manufacturers and store their  
productions lor -a long time, perhaps longer  
than we can, ot will bear to board ours. In  
1794, upon these principles, and for these  
reasons, I thought it my.xduty to, decide in  
Senate against Mr. MadIsox&#x27;s Resolutions,  
as they Aere called, and I have seen no reason  
to alter my opinion since. I own I was sorry  
when the late non importation law passed.-.  
When a war w1tl -England was seriously ap­  
prehended in t794,&quot;I approved of an Embargo  
as a temporary measure to preserve our sea­  
men and property ;but not with any expect­  
.ation that it would&quot; influence England. I  
thought the Embargo which was laic a year  
ago, a wise and prudent measure, for the  
same reason, viz. to preserve ouc seamen and  
asjrmchof our property as&#x27; we could get in;  
but not with the faintest hope that it would in­  
fluence the British councils. At the same  
time I: confidently expected, that it would be  
raised in a few months.- I have not censured  
any of these measures, becaussp I know the  
fond attachment&quot; of the natioriJo them ; but J  
tlrink the nation must soon-be convinced that  
they will not answer their expectation. The  
embargo and nou-irnportatioii laws-! think,  
  
ought not to last Ion jr. &#x27; Ther uitilaY tuch a  
  
foundation of. disaffection to the National Go  
  
vernment as will give great uneasiness to Mr.  
Jefferson&#x27;s successor, and will produce such  
distractions and confusions as I shudder to  
think of. The naval and military force to  
tarry them into execution would maintain a  
war. Are you &quot;thjerj for war, you will ask i  
I will answer you&quot; candidly : I think a war  
would be a less evil than a rigorous enforce­  
ment of the embargo and a non-intercourse  
But we have no necessity to&#x27;declare war against  
England or France or both. We may raise  
the embargo, repeal the non-importation, au  
thorize our merchants to arm their vessels ;  
give them special letters of marque to defend  
themselves against&#x27; all unlawful aggressors;  
and take, burn or destroy H&quot;vessels, or make  
prize 6f them, as enemies, that shall attack  
Vhem. In the mean time apply alLour re­  
sources to build frigates ; some in every principal  
seaport. These frigates ought not to  
be assembled in any one port, to become an  
obj-.-ct of a hostile expedition-to destroy them.  
Tney should be separated and scattered, as  
much as possible, from Mew-Orleans to Pas­  
su maquoikly. 1 never Was fond of the plan  
of building line of battle ships. Our policy  
is not to fight squadrons at sea ; but to have  
fast sailinir fngates, to scour the seas, and  
make impressions on the enemies commerce ;  
aa&#x27;d in; this way we can do great things. Ou  
great sea ports and most exposed frontier  
places ought not be neglected in their forti­  
fications ; but I cannot sec for what purpose  
an hundred thousand militia are called out.  
nor why we should have so large an army at  
present. The revenues applied to these uses  
would be better appropriated to building fri  
gates. We may depend upon it, we shall  
never be respected by&#x27; foreign powers, until  
they see that we are sensibh of the great re­  
sources which the Almighty, in his benevo  
lent Providence, has put into our hands. No  
  
fnation under the sun has better materials,  
  
architectS or mariners for a respectable ma­  
ritime power. I have no doubt our people,  
when they see a necessity, will cheerfully  
pay the taxes necessary for their defence, and  
to support their Union, Independence, and  
National Honor. When our merchants are  
armccl, if they arc taken,&quot;they cannot blame  
the government. If they fiht well and cap­  
ture their enemies, they will acquire glory  
and encouragement at home ; and England  
or France may determine for themselves  
whether they will declare war. I believe nei­  
ther will do it, because each will be afraid of  
our joining the other. If either should, in  
my opinion, the other Will , rescind ; but if  
we should have both tol fight, it wourdnot be  
long before one or the other would be willing  
to make peace ; and I see not much differ­  
ence between fighting both and fighting Eng­  
land alone.  
My heart is with the Spanish Patriots, and  
1 should be glad to assist them as far as our  
commerce can supply them. 1 conclude with  
.icknowleclgi; g that we have received greater  
injuries from England thanjrom France, a­  
bominable as both have b n. IVhatevei&#x27; the  
Government determines I shall suiiort as Jar  
as my small voice extends.

Quinct, 26th Dec. 1808.  
Sir,  
I RECEIVE very k udly yodrobliging  
(Letter of the 18th of this month. Ever  
since my return from Europe, where I had  
resided ten years, and could not be fuily in­  
formed of the siate of affairs, in inv own  
country, I have been constantly anxious  
and alarmed at the intemperance of party  
; spirit, and the unbounded license of «ur  
; presses. In the same view, l could not but  
; | lament some things, which have lately pas­  
sed in public bodies. To instance, at D d­  
ham and Topsfteld, and last of ail in the  
resolutions of our Mu&lt;lsachus.-tts legislature.  
Upon principle, I see no right in our Senate  
and llouse to dictate, or advise, or to re­  
quest oar Representatives in Congress. —  
The right of the people, to instruct their re­  
presentatives is veiy dear to them, and will  
never be disputed by tne* But this is a  
very different tiling from an interference  
of a state legislature. Congress must be  
i the “cloud by day and the pillar of fire by  
, night,” to conduct this nation ; and if their  
eyes are to be diverted by wandering light  
accidentally springing up in every directi­  
on, *e shall never get through the wilder­  
i  
not been inattentive to the course  
oW public affairs. and agree with Con­  
gress in their resolutions to resist the de„  
crees, edicts and orders of France and En­  
gland ; but I think, the king’s proclamation  
for the impressment ot seamen on board our  
merchant ships, has not been distinctly e­  
nough reprobated. It is the most ground­  
less pretension of all. Retired as I am, con­  
versing with very few of any party ; out of  
the secret of affairs ; collecting information  
only from public papers and pamphlets, ma­  
ny links in the great chain of deliberations,  
actions and events, may have escaped me.  
You will easily believe, tnat an excessive  
diffidence in my own opinions has not been  
“ the sin, that has most easily beset me.”  
I must nevertheless confess to you, that in  
all the intricate combinations of affairs, to  
which I have ever been a witness, I never  
Ixllnil ......... I f .... --k _ I__ . _ C_  
  
judgment of what ilic nation ought to do,  
or what part I ought to act. No man, then,  
I hope, will have more confidence in the so.  
lidity of any thing I may suggest, than I  
have myself.  
I revere the upright and enlightened ge­  
neral sense of our American nation. Ic is  
nevertheless capable, like othrr nations, of  
general prejudice and national errors. A­  
moog these I know not whether there Is a*  
ny more remarkable than that opinion, so  
universal, that it is in our power to bring  
foreign nations to our own terms, by with,  
holding our commerce. Whan the execu.  
t ve ami legislative authority of any nation,  
especially in the old governments and great  
powers oi Europe, have adopted measures,  
upon deliberation, and published them to  
th« world, they cannot recede, without a  
deep humiliation and disgrace, in the eyes  
of their own subjects, as well as all Europe.  
They will therefore obstinately adhere to  
them, at the expense even of great sacri.  
fices, and in defiance of great dangers. In  
1774, Congress appeared almost unan  
imously sanguine, that a non importation  
and consumption association, would procure  
immediate repeal of Acts of Parliament  
and Royal Orders. I went heartily along  
with the rest in all these meassures, be­  
cause I knew, that the sense of the nation,  
the public opinion in all the colonies re­  
quired them ; and I did not see that they  
could do harm, bat 1 had no confidence in  
their success, m any thing but uniting the  
American People. I expressed thisopin.  
ion (reely to some of my friends, particular,  
ly to Mr. Henry, of Virginia, and to Ma­  
jor Hawlkt, of Massachusetts. These  
two, and these only, agreed with me in o­  
pinion, that we must fight after all. We  
found by experience, that a war of eight  
years, in addition to all ouv resolutions,  
was necessary ; and the aid of France,  
Spain and Holland too, before our purposes ,  
could be accomplished. Do we presume  
that we can excite Insurrection, Rebellion,  
and a revolution in England f Even a Rev­  
olution would be no benefit to us. A Re.  
publican government in England would be &lt;  
► ~  
  
nore hostile tout than the Monarchy is.  
[&#x27;he resources of that country aye so great;  
heir Merohants, Capitalists, and princi­  
&gt;al Manufacturers are so rich, th it they  
:an employ their manufactures and store  
.heir productions for a long time, perhaps  
longer tUas* we can, or will bear to hoard  
juts.  
In 1794, upon these principles, and for  
these reasons, l thought it my duty to de_  
C&#x27;de in Senate against Mr. Madison&#x27;s Re­  
solutions, as they were called, and I have  
seen no reason to alter my opinion since. I  
own 1 was sorry when the late non impor­  
tation law passed.—When a war with En­  
gtaodwas seriously apprehended in 1794, I  
approved of an embargo as a temporary  
measure to preserve our seamen and pro­  
perty ; but not with any expectation that it  
would influence England. I thought the  
embargo winch was laid a year ago, a wise  
and prudent measure, for the same reason,  
viz. to preserve our seamen and as much ot  
our property as we couid get in; but not  
with the fa ntest hope that it would influ­  
ence the British councils. At the same  
time, I confidently expected, that it would  
be raised in a few months. I have not  
censured any of these measures, because I  
knew the fond attachment of the nation to  
them ; but I think the nation must soon be  
convinced that they will not answer*tlleir  
expectations. The embargo and the non­  
importation laws, I think ought not to last  
lortg. They will lay such a foundation of  
disaffection to the national government as  
will give great uneasiness to Mr. Jcffcr.  
son&#x27;s successor, and will produce such dis­  
tractions and confusion as I shudder to  
think ot. The naval and military torce  
to carry tlie.n into execution would main­  
tain a war. Are you then for war, you  
will ask i 1 will answer you candidly : 1  
think a war would be a less evil than a ri­  
gorous enforcement of the emoargo and a  
non-intercourse* But we have no necessity  
to declare war against England or France,  
or both. VVe may raise the Embargo, re­  
peal the non importation law, auuionzc  
our merchants to arm their vessels; give  
them special Letters of Alanjue to deteud  
theinscivec against all unlawful aeirressors:  
  
K tnlte, bum »jr destroy all vessels, or matte  
[mse of them, as enemies, that shall attack,  
them. In tue mean time, apply all our  
resources to build irigates; some in every  
principal sea port. These frigates ought  
not to be assembled in any one port to be­  
come an object of a host le expedition to  
destroy them. T.iey mould be separated  
and scattered as much as possible, from  
New Orleans «i Passaniaquoddy. I never  
was fond of the plan ot bui.dmg line of bat­  
t.e ships. Our policy is not to tight squa­  
drons at sea ; but to nave fast sailing fri­  
gates to scour the seas, and make im­  
pressions on the enemies* commerce ; and  
in this way we can do great things. Our  
great sea-poris and moat exposed frontier  
places ougnt not to be neglected in their  
tortiftcatious; but I cannot see for wliat  
purpose an nundred thousand Militia are  
cal.ed out, or why we should have so large  
an army at present. TheUcVcnues appi.ed  
to these uses would be better appropriated  
to building Kr.gates. We may depend up­  
on it, we snail never be respected by for­  
eign powers, until they see tnat we are  
sensible of tue great resources which the  
Almighty, in his benevolent Providence,  
has put into our hands. No nation under  
the sun has better materials, architects,  
or mariners for a respectable maritime  
power.—1 have no doubt our people, when  
tney see a necessity for the defence, and to  
support their Union, Independence and  
National Honor. — When our merchants  
are armed, if they are taacn, they cannot  
blame the government. If they tight well,  
and capture their enemies, they will ac­  
quire glory and encouragement at home ;  
and England or France may determine for  
themselves whether they w.ll declare war.  
1 believe neither will do it, because each  
will be atraid of our joining the other, it  
either should, in my opinion, the other will  
rescind; but if we should have both to  
tight, it would not be long before one or  
the other would be willing to make peace ;  
and i see not much difference between  
lighting both and lighting England alone.

In hit letter of Dec. 36, 1808, he  
•ays, “ The embargo and non-impor­  
tatiun laws, ought not to last long.  
They will lay such a foundation to the  
national government, as will give great  
uneasiness to Mr. Jefferson’s success*  
or, and will produce such distraction  
and confusion as I shudder to think  
of.” There he condemns a long con­  
tinuance of the Embargo, which, on  
the 9th January following, he woul

“ Authorize our merchants to arm their vessels j—

or destroy, all vessels, or m&amp;c prizes of them as en­

object of an hostile expedition te destroy them.—  
They should be separated and scattered as much as  
possible, from New. Orleans to Passamuquoddy. I  
never was fond of” the plan of buildinf a line of hattle

to have fust suiling frigates Lo scour the seas and make  
impressions on the enemies’ commerce ; and in this

No nation under the sun has better materials, archi­

“ When our merchants are apmed, if they are laken
