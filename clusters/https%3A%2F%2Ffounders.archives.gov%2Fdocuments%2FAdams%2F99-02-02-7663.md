I know not that I ever received a letter with more pleasure than yours of the 30 June last except the circular from your committee which I received some days before. The wisdom &amp; liberality generosity of your Legislature in making a liberal appropriation of money for the benefit of schools Academies colleges &amp; the university is an equal honor to them &amp; their constituents—a proof of their veneration for literature and science and a portent of great &amp; lasting good to North &amp; South America and to the world. Great is truth—great is liberty &amp; great is humanity &amp; they must stand and will prevail. I have communicated your letters to as many of my friends as I have seen &amp; requested them to assist me in complying with your views. If the taper thread of life should continue to burn a little longer I hope that you will hear more from me. At present blind &amp; paralytic I am incapable of research or search. I can only give hints from memory. A law of this colony almost two hundred years ago obliged every town to maintain a school master capable of teaching the Greek and Roman languages as well as reading writing and Arithmetic in English. Those school masters were to be examined by the clergymen and magistrates and the clergymen in those days were all learned men. This law is in force to this hour though not so punctually executed as it ought to be. I had myself the honour to be a school master from 1755 to 1758, in the town of Worcester; under this law. These school masters and school houses are maintained by  taxes involuntarily imposed on themselves by the people in town meeting annualy &amp; the ardor of the people in voting money for this  noble purpose is astonishing. In this small town of Quincy consisting of not more than 1400 inhabitants I think they voted this year $1700 for the support of schools—more than a dollar a head for every woman &amp; child in the place. The principal school which is not more than half a mile from me pours out of its doors at 12 Oclock every day from one hundred to two hundred boys &amp; girls as happy as Scott or Shenstone has described them &amp; their masters in their romances. Besides this principal school there are not less than four or five there schools kept by women in different parts of the towns for children of both sexes not too young to be able to travel to the central school. I esteem myself highly Beside these town schools there are academies erected under the auspices of the Legislature &amp; others established by private munificence for teaching languages arts &amp; sciences on a more enlarged scale. All these subordinate institutions are preparatory to the qualification of young gentlemen to enter the university. The universities and the schools mutually support each other—The schools furnish students for the college and four years afterwards the college sends the young men into the country to keep school I esteem myself highly honored by your circular and your letter of the 30th June and am Sir your very obedient humb Servt

MONTIZILLO, QUINCY, JULY 22, 1822.  
Sir—I know not that I ever received a let-  
ler with more pleasure than yours of the 30th  
June last, except the circular from your Com-  
mittee, which I received some days before.  
The wisdom and generosity of your leg-  
islature in making liberal appropriations in  
money for the benefit of Schools, Academies,  
Colleges, and the University, is equal honour  
to them and their constituents; a proof of  
their veneration for literature and science,  
and a portent of great and lasting good to  
North and South America, and tothe World.  
Great is truth, great is liberty, and great  
is humanity, and they must and will prevail.  
I have communicated your letters to as  
many of my friends asI have seen, and re-  
quested them to assist me in complying with  
your views. Ifthe taper thread of life should  
continue to burn a little longer, I hope that  
you will hear more from me. At present,  
bling and paralytic, Iam incapable of re-  
searchor search. I can only give hints from  
memory. A law of this colony, almost two  
hundred years ago obliged every town to  
maintain a school-master, capable of teach-  
ing the Greek and Roman Languages, as  
well as reading, writing, and arithmetic, in  
English. ‘Those school-masters were to be  
examined by clergymen and magistrates ; and  
the clergymen in those days were all learn-  
ed men. This law is in force to this hour ;  
though not so punctually executed as it ought  
to be. I had myself the honour to be a school-  
master from 1755 to 1768, in the town of  
Worcester, under this law. These school-  
masters and school-houses are maintained by  
taxes, voluntarily imposed on themselves by  
the people, in town meeting, annually : and  
the ardor of the people in voting money for  
this noble purpose, is astonishing. In this  
small town of Quincy, consisting of not more  
than 1400 inhabitants, I think they voted  
this year $1700, for the supy-ort of schools—  
more than adollar a head for every man,  
woman and child in the place. The princi-  
pal school, which is not more than half a  
mile from me, pours out of its doors, at I2  
clock every day, from one to two hundred  
boys and girls, as happy as Scott or Shens-  
tone has described them and their masters, in  
their romances. _ Besides their principal  
school, there are not less than four or five  
schools kept by women in different parts of  
the town for ehildren of both sexes, too  
young to be able to travel to the central  
school. Besides these town schools, there  
are Academies under the auspicies of  
the legislature, and others established by  
prisate munificence for languages, arts and  
sciences, on a more enlarged scale—All these  
subordinate institutions are preparatory to  
the qualification of young gentlemen to enter  
the University—The Universities and the  
schools mutually support each other; the  
schools furnish students for the College, and  
four years afterwards, the College sends the  
young men intothe country to keep school.

The wisdom and generosity of your legislature  
in making liberal appropriations in money, for the  
benefit of schools, academies, colleges and the uni-  
versity, is an equal honor to them and their consti-  
‘tuents; a proof of their veneration for literature and  
science, and a portent of great and lasting good to  
North and South America and to the world.  
  
Great is truath—great is liberty, and great is hu-  
manity, and they must and will prevail. I have  
communicated your letters to as many of my friends  
as I have seen, and requested them to assist me in  
complying with your views. Ifthe taper thread of  
life should continue to burn a little longer, I hope  
that you will hear more from me. At present,  
blind and paralytic, I am incapable of research or

law of this colony,-almost two hundred years ago,  
obliged every town to maintain a school master,  
capable of teaching the Greek and Roman lan-  
guages, as well as reading, writing and arithmetic  
in English. Those school masters were to be ex.  
amined by the clergymen and magistrates; and the  
clergymen in those days were all learned men.—  
This law is in force to this hour, though not so  
punctually executed as it ought to be. 1 had my-  
self the honor to be a school master from 1755 to  
1758, in the town of Worcester, under this law.  
These school masters and school houses, are main-  
tained by taxes, voluntarily imposed pn themselves  
hy the people, in town meeting, annualy; and the  
ardor of the people in voting money for this noble  
purpose, is astonishing. In this small town of  
Quinty, consisting of not more than 1,400 inha-  
bitants, I think they voted, this year, $1,700, for  
the suppert of schools—more than a doJlar a head  
for every man, woman, and child in this place. The  
principal school, which is not more than half a  
mile from me, pours out of its doors, at twelve  
o’clock every day, from one hundred to two hun-  
dred boys and girls, as happy as Scott or Shenton,  
has described them and their masters, in their ro-

not less than four or five schools kept by woman in  
different parts of the town, for children of both  
sexes, too young to be able to travel to the central  
school. Besides these town schools, there are  
academies under the auspices of the legislature,  
and others established by private munificence for

men to enter the university. The universities and  
the schools mutually support each other; the schools  
furnish students for the college, and four years af-  
terwards, the college sends the young men into the  
country to keep school.  
  
I esteem myself highly honored by your circular  
and your letter of the 30th June. And am, sir,  
your very obedient, humble serv’t.
