Dear Sir  
Fish-kill, Octr 3d 1778.  
  
Your favor of the 23d Ult. came to my hands at Fredericksburg the Afternoon before I left it for this place. I thank you for the transmission of Mr Beresfords intelligence, tho I have not the smallest Idea that any thing more than a deception, is meant by it; and, that Mr Williams is either a voluntary Agent, or the innocent instrument, for carrying it on.
