to section 5,335 of the Revised Statutes of

to know that under the provisions of this  
section any citizen of the United States,  
whether residing here or in a foreign coun-  
try, who, without the permission or author-  
ity of the Government, directly or indi-  
rectly, commences or carries on any verbal

and to be fined $5,000. Any citizen who  
counsels, advises, or assists in any such  
correspondence is liable to suffer the same  
punishment. The Attorney-General is fully  
posted on this provision of the laws, and  
there is good reason to believe that the  
British Government is not less anxious  
than the American authorities to establish  
the identity of ‘‘Charles F. Murchison”
