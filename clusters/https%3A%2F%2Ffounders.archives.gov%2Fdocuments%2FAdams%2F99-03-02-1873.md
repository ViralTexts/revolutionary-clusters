Nothing so strongly proclaims the immortality  
of the soul as its restlessness and longings for  
something more than this world can give. Men  
have denied the existence of an overruling  
Power, but their own uncertainty proclaims  
that they are working against the teachings of  
reason. Man has tried every sensual pleasure,  
has revelled in every argument of those who  
declare that this world, with its pleasures, is  
the only seat of happiness; but how tinged  
with gloom his fairest prospects that must suc-  
cumb to the mandate of Nature!
