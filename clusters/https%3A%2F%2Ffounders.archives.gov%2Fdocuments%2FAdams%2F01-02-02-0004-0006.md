There is also a long Entry, where Gentlemen may walk, and a convenient Chamber opposite to the Library. The General Cry was, that this was a good Room, and the Question was put, whether We were satisfyed with this Room, and it passed in the Affirmative. A very few were for the Negative and they were chiefly from Pensylvania and New York.  
  
Then Mr. Lynch arose, and said there was a Gentleman present who had presided with great Dignity over a very respectable Society, greatly to the Advantage of America, and he therefore proposed that the Hon.

Mr. Randolph then took the Chair, and the Commissions of the Delegates were all produced and read.

The whole countryside from Boston almost to New York City was roused by the report, and the ever-curious Ezra Stiles made an elaborate and valuable investigation of the spread of the false rumor of bloodshed (Stiles, Literary DiaryThe Literary Diary of Ezra Stiles, D.D., LL.D., President of Yale College, ed.

Mr. Henry. Government is dissolved. Fleets and Armies and the present State of Things shew that Government is dissolved.—Where are your Land Marks? your Boundaries of Colonies.  
We are in a State of Nature, Sir. I did propose that a Scale should be laid down. That Part of N. America which was once Mass. Bay, and that Part which was once Virginia, ought to be considered as having a Weight. Will not People complain, 10,000 People Virginians have not outweighed 1000 others.  
I will submit however. I am determined to submit if I am overruled.  
A worthy Gentleman (Ego) near me, seemed to admit the Necessity of obtaining a more Adequate Representation.  
I hope future Ages will quote our Proceedings with Applause. It is one of the great Duties of the democratical Part of the Constitution to keep itself pure. It is known in my Province, that some other Colonies are not so numerous or rich as they are. I am for giving all the Satisfaction in my Power.  
The Distinctions between Virginians, Pensylvanians, New Yorkers and New Englanders, are no more.  
I am not a Virginian, but an American.  
Slaves are to be thrown out of the Question, and if the freemen can be represented according to their Numbers I am satisfyed.

ers of the Crown.  
I go upon the Supposition, that Government is at an End. All Distinctions are thrown down. All America is all thrown into one Mass. We must aim at the Minutiae of Rectitude.  
Mr. Jay. Could I suppose, that We came to frame an American Constitution, instead of indeavouring to correct the faults in an old one—I cant yet think that all Government is at an End. The Measure of arbitrary Power is not full, and I think it must run over, before We undertake to frame a new Constitution.

wing Answer, to a Question Why the Lawyers were so increased.  
  
“You ask me why Lawyers so much are increas’d  
Tho most of the Country already are fleec’d  
The Reason I’m sure is most strikingly plain  
The Sheep are oft sheered yet the Wool grows again  
And tho you may think e’er so odd of the Matter  
The oft’ner they’re fleeced, the Wool grows the better  
Thus downy-chin’d Boys as oft I have heard  
By frequently shaving obtain a large Beard.”

Mr. Dickinson has a fine Seat, a beautyfull Prospect, of the City, the River and the Country—fine Gardens, and a very grand Library. The most of his Books, were collected by Mr. Norris, once Speaker of the House here, father of Mrs. Dickinson. Mr. Dickinson is a very modest Man, and very ingenious, as well as agreable.
