.  
The times appear not ripe enough for the editor to give expression to the affection, gratitude, and veneration, he bears to a writer he has so intimately studied: Nor is it wanting to the author; as history lies in wait for him, and the judgement of mankind balances already in his favor. The editor wishes only that other readers may reap that improvement from his productions, which he conceives they have rendered to himself.— Yet perhaps he may be excused for stating one opinion: He conceives that no man ever made larger or bolder guesses than Dr. Franklin from like materials in politics and philosophy, which, after the scrutiny of events and of fact, have been more completely verified. Can Englishmen read these things, and not sigh at recollecting that the country which could produce their author, was once without controversy their own!— Yet he who praises Dr. Franklin for mere ability, praises him for that quality of his mind, which stands lowest in his own esteem. Reader, whoever you are, and how much soever you think you hate him, know that this great man loves you enough to wish to do you good:  
His country’s friend, but more of human kind.
