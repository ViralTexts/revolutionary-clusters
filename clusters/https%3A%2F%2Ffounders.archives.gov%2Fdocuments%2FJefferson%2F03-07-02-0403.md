electrified his hearers. it had been urged that from certain unhappy circumstances of the colony, men of substantial property had contracted debts which, if exacted suddenly, must ruin them  
			 &amp; their families, but with a little indulgence of time might be paid with ease. ‘what, Sir, exclaimed mr Henry, in animadverting on this, is it proposed then to reclaim the Spendthrift from his dissipation and extravagance, by filling his pockets with money?’ these expressions are indelibly

many other incidents, Mr. Jefferson gave Mr.
