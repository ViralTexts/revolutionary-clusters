Richmond Feby 27 1808.  
  
My great anxiety to forward to you the account and receit for the sum which I paid for your mathematical instruments at London, when I should acknowledge your kind letter of the 18th, prevented my answering it sooner. To obtain them I was forced to ransack all my papers, which required much time, &amp; in truth I did not succeed in finding them till this morning. I have now the pleasure to inclose you those papers, by which it appears, that the sum which I paid amounted to £34.10. I had sent the box to Mr Jefferson the day before I recd. your letter, having been so much engaged in other business that I had not been able to attend to it before. To the receit of the sum paid I have no objection, tho I well know that I am indebted to you an equal if not a greater amount. I shall be able to satisfy you of this fact hereafter–when we meet. In the mean time as you desire it, I will with pleasure receive that sum &amp; leave other matters of account to rest as they are.  
I can assure you that no occurrences of my whole life ever gave me so much concern as some which took place during my absence abroad, proceeding from the present administration. I allude more especially to the mission of Mr. Pinkney with all the circumstances connected with that measure, and the manner in which the treaty which he and I formed, which was in fact little more than a project, was received. I do not wish to dwell on those subjects. I resolved that they should not form any motive of my publick or private conduct, and I proceeded to execute my publick duty in the same manner, and to support and advance to the utmost of my power your political &amp; personal fame, as if they had not occurr’d. The latter–object has been felt through life by me scarcely as a secondary one, for from the high respect which I have entertained for your publick services, talents &amp; virtues I have seen the national interest, and your advancement and fame so intimately connected, as to constitute essentially the same cause. Besides I have never forgotten the proofs of kindness &amp; friendship which I received from you in early life.  
When I returnd to the UStates I found that heavy censure had fall’n on me in the publick opinion, as I had before much reason to believe was the case, in consequence of my having signed the British treaty. And when I returned here from Washington, I was assured that that circumstance was wielded against me with great effect in relation to a particular object; that it was relied on to impeach my character in the most delicate points. Conscious that I had served my country &amp; the administration in the several trusts confided to me abroad, with the utmost integrity, industry &amp; zeal; that in some cases I had render’d useful service; that in all I had done the most that could be done under existing circumstances; that my private fortune had been essentially injured by those employments, it was impossible for me to be insensible to the effect produc’d by those attacks. They have injurd &amp; continue to injure me every day in the publick estimation. I trust however that means may be found to do me justice, without the slightest injury to you. Be that as it may, you may be assured that I shall never cease to take a deep interest in your political fame &amp; personal happiness.  
I informed Mr Madison when I was at Washington that I should write him a letter in reply to his of May 20th. 1807. on the subject of the treaty to answer some of his objections to it, and place in a just light the conduct of the American Commissrs in that transaction. I informed him also that as I wished to couch that letter in the most amicable terms, if he shod. find any passage in it, which failed in that respect, I shod. be happy to alter it, having in mind only a fair vindication of my conduct. I have almost concluded the letter &amp; shall forward it in the course of the next week, the early part of it if possible. my private concerns have subjected me to much interruption, or I shod. have finished it sooner.  
In regard to the approaching election I have been and shall continue to be an inactive spectator of the mov’ment. Should the nation be disposed to call any citizen to that station it would be his duty to accept it. On that ground I rest. I have done nothing to draw the attention of any one to me in reference to it, nor shall I in future. No one better knows than I do the merit of Mr Madison, and I can declare that should he be elected he will have my best wishes for the success of his administration, as well on account of the great interest which I take in what concerns his welfare as in that of my country. His success will give me no personal mortification. It will not lessen my friendship for him which is sincere &amp; strong. I am with the highest respect and with great s

Kicb:twndt Feb 27, 1&amp;.3.  
Dear Sir.  
Mv great anxiety to forward to  
you the account and receipt for the  
sum which I paid for your mathe  
nutical instruments at London,  
fchen I should acknowledge your  
hte kind letter, prevented my an­  
swering it sooner. To obtain them  
I was forced to ransack all my pa-1  
ptrs, wrucn required much time,  
nd in truth I did not succeed in  
Ending them till thin morning. I  
kvc now the pleasure to inclose  
Jou thuse papers.  
I can assure you that no occur  
cs of ray whole life, ever gave  
: math concern, as some  
  
  
which took.p&#x27;ace during my ab­  
sence abroad, proceeding trom the  
present administration. I allude  
more especially to the miss on of  
Mr. Pinckney, with all the cir­  
cumstances, connected with that  
measure, and the manner in which  
the treaty which he and I formexl.  
which in fact was little more than  
a project, was received. I do n t  
wish to dwell on these subjects, i  
resolved that they should form no  
motive of my public or private con­  
duct, and I proceeded to execute  
my public duty in the same man  
  
ncr and to support and to ad ancc ,  
j to the utmost of my power, your  
personal and political fame, as 11  
they had not occurred. The lat­  
ter object, has been felt by me  
through lile, scarcely as a second  
ary one, for from the high respe- t  
which ! have entertained for )ou.  
public servicrs, your talents an  
virtues, I have peen the national  
interest, your adv incement an.  
tame, so intimately connected, a­  
to constitute essentially the same  
:ause. Doulc-s 1 nave never 101­  
jottrn the proofs of kindness  
.nd friendsh&#x27;iD. which I received  
irom ou in carlv life.  
When 1 returned to the U.  
States I found that heavy censure  
vad laden on me in the public opi­  
nion, as I had b?f;rc much reason  
t believe wTas the case, in conse­  
quence of my having signed the  
iJ&#x27;itUh treaty, and when 1 return­  
ed here irom Washington, i was  
isurcd that cin unmtancc was  
.yielded against me with great ef  
fttt, in relation to a particular ob­  
t 1 1- thai it was relied on toim-i-e  
.ch rm character in the most  
cicluati p mis.  
Conscious, that I had served mv  
country and the administration, in  
the evcr.d trusts, confided to m­  
broad, with the utmost integrity,  
n ,&#x27;uitrv and zral ; that in some  
.ascs, I had rendered useful ser­  
vice, that in all, I had done the  
not that could be done, under  
t-xisting circumstances ; that mv  
privuU- fortune, had been esseu  
:ia l injured by those employ­  
mriits, it was impossible for me to  
e insensible, to the effects produ  
t d ny those attacks. They have  
injured me and continue to injure  
me every day in the public esti­  
mation. I trust, however, that  
me ms ma be found to do mr  
justice, without tne slightest inju­  
ry to you. Be that a- it may, )Ou  
mav be assured, that I shall ne  
J vcr cease to take a deep interest  
, in your political fame &amp; personal  
j happiness.  
I informed Mr. Madison when  
I was at Washington, that I should  
write him a Irtter, in reply to his  
of May the 20:h, 1807, on the sub­  
ject of the treaty, to answer some  
of his objections to it, and place  
in a just light, the conduct of the  
Amcricm Commissioners in that  
transaction. I informed him also,  
that as 1 wished to cou h that let­  
ter in the most amicable terms,  
if he should find any passage in  
it. hich failed in thu t respect, I  
should be happy to alter it, having  
in view only a fair vindication ol  
my conduct. I have almost con­  
cluded the Irtter, and shall for­  
ward ;t in the course of the next  
week, the early part of it, if possi­  
b&#x27;e. My private concerns have  
subjected me to much interrup­  
tion, or I should have finished it  
sooner.  
In regard to the approaching e­  
ection I have been and shall con  
tinue to be an inactive spectator  
of the movement. Should the n  
tion be disposed to call any citizcry  
to that station, it would be his du  
ty to accept. On that ground 1  
rest. I have done nothing to  
draw the attention of any one to  
me in reference to it, nor shall I  
in future. No one better knows  
than I do the merit cf Mr. Madi  
son, and I can declare that should  
he be elected, he will have my bct  
  
wishes, for the success of his ad­  
ministration, as well oh account ol  
the real interest which I take in  
what concerns his welfare, as in  
that t my country. His success  
will give me no personal mortifi  
tion. It will not lessen my friend  
hipforhim, which is ardent and  
strong, I am, Dear Sir
