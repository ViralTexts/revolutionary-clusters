. I have never had but one opinion concerning banking from the institution of the first in Philadelphia by Mr. Robert Morris &amp; Mr. Governeur Morris—&amp; that opinion has uniformly been that the banks have done more injury to the religion, morality, tranquility, prosperity, and even wealth of the nation, than they ever have done or ever will do good; they are like party spirit the delusion of the many for the interest of a few. I have always thought that Sir Isaac Newton and Mr. Locke a hundred years ago at least had scientiffically demonstratively settled all questions of this kind. Silver &amp; gold are but the commodities as much as wheat and lumber—the merchants who study the necessity &amp; feel out the wants of the community can always import enough to supply the necessery circulating currency as they can broadcloths or sugar—the trinkets  of Birmingham &amp; Manchester—or the hemp of Liberia. I am old enough to have seen a paper currency anihilated at a blow in Massachusetts in 1750, and a silver currency takings its place immediately &amp; supplying every necessity &amp; every convenience I cannot enlarge upon this subject; it has always been incomprehensible to me that a people so jealous of their liberty &amp; property as the Americans should so long have borne impositions with patience and submission which would have been trampled under foot in the meanest village in Holland or undergone the fate of Woods half pence in Ireland. I beg leave to refer you to a work which Mr. Jefferson has sent me translated by himself from a French Manuscript of the Count Destutt Tracy. His Chapt. “Of Money” contains the sentiments that I have entertained all my life time. I will quote only a few lines from the anylytical table page 21—“It is to be desired that coins had never borne other names than those of their weights &amp; that the arbitrary denominations are called  monies of account as £—S—d. &amp;c. had never been used but when these denominations are admitted and employed in transacteions called to diminish the quantity of metal to which they answer by an alteration of the real coins is to steal &amp; it is a theft which even injures him who commits it—A theft of a greater magnitude &amp; still more ruinous is the making of paper-money it is greater because in this money there is absolutely no real value it is greatermore ruinous because by its gradual depreciation during all this time of its existence it produces the effect which would be produced by an infinity of successive deteorations of the coins; all these iniquities are founded on the false idea that money is but a sign.” Permit me to recommend this vol. to your attentive perusal.

I have never bad but one opin&#x27;bn con­  
cerning banking, from.the institution of  
the first, in PnUadelphia, by. Mr. Robert  
Morris and , Mr. Gouycrutur Morris, and  
that opinion ha3 .unifurinly been that the  
banks have done more injury to the re­  
ligion, morality, tranquillity, prosperity,  
and even wealth of the nation, than they  
can have done or ever will, do good.  
They are like party spirit, the delusion of  
the many for the interest of a few. I  
have always thought that Sir Isaac New  
t6n and Mr. Lccke, a hundred years, ago,  
at least, had ecientificsdly and demonstra­  
tively settled all questions of ibis kind.  
Silver and gold are but commodities, as  
wheat and lumber; the merchants who  
study the necessity, and feel out the  
wants of the community, can always im­  
port enough to supply the necessary cir­  
culating currency, as they can broad­  
cloth or eugar, the trinkets of Birming­  
ham and Manchester, or the hemp of Si­  
beria. I am old enough to have seen a  
paper currency annihilated at a blow in  
Massachusetts, in 1750, and a silver cur­  
rency taking its place immediately, and  
supply every necessity and every con­  
venience. I cannot enlarge upon this  
subject; it has always been incompre­  
hensible to me that a people so jealous of  
their liberty and property as the Ameri­  
cans, thould so long have barne imposi­  
tions with patience andsubrnission, which  
would have been trampled under foot in  
the meanest village in Hollaed or under­  
gone the fate of Wood&#x27;s half pence in  
Ireland. I beg leave to rcferyouto awork  
which Mr. Jefferson has sent me, trans­  
lated by himself from a French manu­  
script of the Count Destute Tracy. His  
chapter &quot;ot morcy&quot; contains the senti­  
ment that I httve entertained all my life­  
time. I will quote only a few lines from  
the ana&#x27;ydcal table, page 21 : &quot;It is to  
be desired, that coin had never borne  
other names thaa those of their weight,  
and that arbitrary denominations, calicd  
moneys of account, , s,d, (or dollars and  
cents), etc., had nevt r been usjd. But  
when these denc miuit&#x27;Dus, are admitted  
and employed in transactions, to dimin­  
ish the quantity of m tal to which they  
answer, an alteration of the real coins, is

jures him who commits it. A theft of  
greater magnitude and still mure rumous,  
is the making of paper money; it is  
greater, because in this moniy there is  
absolutely no real value; it is more ruin­  
ous, because, by its gradual depreciati m  
during all the time of its existence,  
it produces the effect which would be  
produced by an infinity of successive de­

respecting the virtues of paper money? That he was no  
friend of it is evident from his reply to the letter of John  
Taylor, recommending the latter to read Count Destutt  
Tracy&#x27;s work upon Political Economy, which had just been  
translated by Jefferson. Adams says : “His chapter ‘Of JZoney’  
contains the sentiments I have contended for all my life-  
time.” After quoting a passage declaring that to diminish  
the quantity of metals in coins is to steal, the quotation con-  
tinues, “A theft of greater magnitude and still more ruinous,  
is the making of paper money; it is greater, because in this  
money there is absolutely no real value; it is more ruinous,  
because, by its gradual depreciation during all the time of  
its existence, it produces the effect which would be produced  
by an infinity of successive deteriorations of the coins. All  
these iniquities are founded on the false idea, that money is

inseparable from the use of it. &quot; &quot;When  
necessity orders to put an end to it , the  
order comes always too late. &quot; *  
VI.  
Opinion of John Adams on paper money.  
Jefferson and Destutt do Tracy.  
I have always thought that Sir Isaac  
Newton and Mr. Locke , a hundred years  
ago , at least , had scientifically and de­  
monstratively settled all questions of  
this kind. Silver and gold are but com­  
modities , as much as wheat and lumber ;  
the merchants who study the necessity ,  
and feel out the wants of the commun­  
ity , can always import enough to sup­  
ply the necessary circulating currency ,  
as they can broadcloth or sugar , the  
trinkets of Birmingham and Manchester ,  
or the hemp of Siberia. I am old  
enough to have seen a paper currency  
annihilated at a blow in Massachusetts ,  
in 1750 , and a silver currency taking  
its place immediately , and supplying  
every necessity and every convenience.  
I cannot enlarge upon this subjest ; it  
it has always boon incomprehensible to­  
me , that a people so jealous of their lib­  
erty and property as the Americans ,  
should so long have boriio impositions  
with patience and submission , which  
would have been trampled under foot in  
the meanest village in Holland , or un­  
dergone the fate of Wood&#x27;s halfpence in  
Ireland. I beg leave to refer you to a work  
which Mr. Jefferson has sent mo , trans­  
lated by himself from a French mauu-  
* Storch , Economic Politiquo , II.108,109 , 412.  
  
script of the Count Destutt do Tracy.  
His chapter &quot;of money&quot; contains the  
sentiments that I have entertained all  
my lifetime. I will quote only a few  
lines from the analytical tablu , piigo 21.  
&quot;It is to be desired , that coins had  
never borne other names than those of  
their weight , and that the arbitrary de­  
nominations , called moneys of account ,  
as , s. , d. , etc. , had never been used.  
But when these denominations are ad­  
mitted and employed in transactions , to  
diminish the quantity of metal to which  
they answer , by an alteration of the real  
coins , it is to steal ; and it is a theft  
which oven injures him who commits it.  
A theft of greater magnitude and still  
more ruinous , is the making of paper  
money ; it is greater , because in this  
money there is absolutely no real value ;  
it is more ruinous , because , by its grad­  
ual depreciation during all the time of  
its existence , it produces the effect  
which would be produced by an infinity  
of successive deteriorations of the coins.  
All those iniquities are founded on the  
false idea , that money is but a sign. &quot;  
Permit me to recommend this volume  
to your attentive perusal.
