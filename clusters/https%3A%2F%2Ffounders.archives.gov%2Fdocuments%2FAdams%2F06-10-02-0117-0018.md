Letter 17  
Sir  
Amsterdam October 26. 1780  
  
The Seventeenth, Inquiry is “whether We have any Information that we can rely on, concerning the Population? has it increased or diminished, Since the War?”  
  
In some former Letters, I have made Some Observations upon the Subject of the Increase of Mankind in America.  
In the Year 1774, There was much private Conversation, among the Members of Congress, concerning the Numbers of Souls in every Colony. The Delegates of each, were consulted, and the Estimates made by them were taken down as follows.  
  
  
In New Hampshire  
  
150,000  
  
  
 Massachusetts  
  
400,000  
  
  
 Rhode Island  
  
59,678  
  
  
 Connecticut  
  
192,000  
  
  
 New York  
  
250,000  
  
  
 New Jersey  
  
130,000  
  
  
  
 Pensilvania and Delaware  
  
350,000

320,000  
  
  
 Virginia  
  
640,000  
  
  
 North Carolina  
  
300,000  
  
  
 South Carolina  
  
225,000  
  
  
  
Total  
3,026,678  
  
  
This however, was but an Estimate, and Some Persons, have thought there was too much Speculation in it. It will be observed, that Georgia, was not represented in the first Congress, and therefore is not included in the Estimate.  
In a Pamphlet published in England about a Year ago, intitled “A Memorial to the Souvereigns of Europe, on the present State of Affairs, between the old and new World,” written by Mr. Pownal, a Member of Parliament and formerly Governor of Massachusetts and Lt. Governor of New Jersey We are told that “The Massachusetts, had in the year 1722, 94,000 Inhabitants, in 1742, 164,000—in 1751, when there was a great depopulation both by War and the Small Pox 164,484—in 1761—216,000—in 1765, 255,500—in 1771—292,000—in 1773 —300,000.  
In Connecticut, in 1756, 129,994—in 1774—257,356. These Numbers are not increased by Strangers, but decreased by Wars and Emigrations to the West ward, and to other States: yet they have nearly doubled in Eighteen Years.  
In New York in 1756—96,776—in 1771—168,007 in 1774—182,251.  
In Virginia in 1756—173,316—in 1764—200,000—in 1774—300,000.  
In South Carolina in 1750—64,000, in 1770—115,000.  
In Rhode Island in 1738—15,000, in 1748—28,439.  
As there never was a Militia, in Pensilvania, before this War with authentic Lists of the Population, it has been variously estimated on Speculation. There was a continual Importation for many years, of Irish and german Emigrants, yet many of these Settled in other Provinces: but the Progress of Population, in the ordinary Course, advanced, in a Ratio, between that of Virginia and that of Massachusetts. The City of Philadelphia, advanced more rapidly. It had in 1749—2076 houses. In 1753, 2300—in 1760, 2969—in 1769—4474—From 1749 to 1753 from 16 to 18,000 Inhabitants, from 1760 to 1769 from 31,318 to 35,000.  
There were in 1754 various Calculations, and Estimates made of the Numbers, on the Continent. The Sanguine, made the Numbers, one Million and an half. Those who admitted less Speculation into the Calculation, but adhered closer to Facts and Lists as they were made out, Stated them at one Million two hundred and Fifty thousand. Governor Pownal thinks that 2,141,307 would turn out nearest to the real Amount in 1774. But what an amazing Progress, which in Eighteen Years, has added a Million to a Million two hundred and fifty Thousand altho a War, was maintained in that Country, for Seven Years of the Term. In this View one Sees a Community unfolding itself, beyond any Example in Europe.  
Thus you have the Estimates made by the Gentlemen in Congress in 1774, and that of Governor Pownal, for the Same Epocha. That made in Congress is most likely to be right. If in their Estimate Some states were rated too high, it has been since made certain that others were too low.  
But admiting Mr. Pownals Estimate to be just, the Numbers, have grown, since 1774 So much notwithstanding the War, and the Interruption of Migrations from Europe, that they must be well nigh three Millions—if the Calculation, made by the Members of Congress was right, the Numbers now, must be nearer four millions than three millions and an half.  
I have observed to you in a former Letter that, the Massachusetts Bay, has been lately numbered and found to have increased in Numbers, as much as in former Periods, very nearly.  
I now add that Delaware, which in 1774 was estimated at 30,000 but upon numbering the People Since, they appeared to be 40,000.  
Rhode Island also in 1774. Pensilvania is undoubtedly set too low in both Estimates.  
I have the honour to be, very respectfully &amp;c.  
  
John Adams

LETTER, XVII.  
Amsterdam, October 26, 1780.  
SIR,  
TH E seventeenth enquiry is, &quot; Whether we  
&quot; have any information that we can rely on con­  
&quot; coming population ? Has it increaftd or dimin­  
&quot; ifhed Juice the war P&quot;  
In some former letters I have made some ob­  
servations upon the fubjeJt of theincreafe of man­  
kind in America.  
111 the year 1774 there was much private con­  
versation among the members of Congress, con­  
cerning the numbers of fouls in every colony.  
The delegates of each were consulted, and the  
eftiniates made by them were taken down as fol­  
low :  
In New-Hainplhire 150,000  
Maflacliufetts 400,000  
Rhode llland 59,678  
Connecticut 192,000  
, New-York 250,000  
New-Jersey 130,000  
Pennsylvania and Delaware 350,000  
Maryland 320,000  
Virginia ■ 640,000  
North Carolina 300,000  
South-Carolina 225,000  
3,016,678  
This however was but aneftiruate, and some per­  
sons have thought there was too much speculation  
in it.—lt will be observed, that Georgia was not  
represented in the firft Congress, and therefore  
is not included in the estimate.  
In a pamphlet publiflied in England about ayear  
ago, entitled a memorial to the Sovereigns  
of Europe, 011 the present State of Affairs, be­  
tween the Old and New-World,&quot; written by  
Mr. Pownal, a Member of Parliament, and for­  
merly Governor of Maflacliufetts, and Lieut. Go­  
vernor of New-Jersey—we are told that &quot; The  
Maflachufets had, in the year 1722, 94,000 inha­  
bitants ; in 1742, 164,000; in I 751, when there  
-was a great depopulation, both by war and the  
small pox, 164,484; in 1761,216,000; in 1765,  
255,500; in 1 771, 292,000; in 1773, 300,000.  
In Connecticut, 1 756, 129,994 ; in 1774, 157,356.  
These numbers are not increased by strangers,  
butdecreafed by wars and emigrations to the west­  
ward, and to other States; yet they have nearly­  
doubled in eighteen years.  
In New-York, in 1756, 96,776 ; in T771, 168,007 ;  
in 1774, 182,251.  
In Virginia, in 1756, 173,316 ; in 1 764, 200,000;  
in 1774, 300,000.  
In Soutli-Carolina, in 1750, 64,000; in 1770,  
115,000.  
In Rliode-Ifland, in 1738, 15,000; in 1748,  
28,439.  
As there never was a militia in Pennsylvania,  
before this war, with authentic lifts of the popu­  
lation, it has been variously estimated on specu­  
lation. There was a continual importation, for  
  
many years, of Irifii and German emigrant#, yet  
many of these fettled in other provinces ; but the  
progress of population, in the ordinary course,  
advanced, i:i a ratio between that of Virginia and  
that of Maflachufetts; the city of Philadelphia ad­  
vanced more rapidly ; it had in I 749,2,076 houses ;  
in 1 7J3, 2,300; in 1760,2,969; in 1769, 4,474;  
from 174910 1753, from 16 to 18,000 inhabitants ;  
from t760t0 J 769, from 31,318 to 3J,000.  
There were in 1754, various calculations and  
estimates made of the numbers on the continent.  
The fanguinemade the numbers one million and  
a half; those who admitted lels (peculation into  
the calculation, but adhered closer to fadts and  
lilts, as they were made out, Itated them at one  
million two hundred and fifty thousand.—Gover­  
nor Pownal thinks, that 2,141,307 would turn out  
nearelt to the real amount in 1774. But what an  
amazing progress, which in eighteen years has  
added a million, to a million two hundred and  
fifty thousand, although a war was maintained in  
that country for seven years of the term ! In this  
view one fees a community unfolding itfejf, be­  
yond any example in Europe.  
Thus you have the estimates made by the gen­  
tlemen in Congress, in 1774, and that of Gover­  
nor Pownal for the fame epocha.—That made in  
Congress is mod likely to be right: If in their es­  
timate some States wete rated too high, it has  
been since made cei tain, that others were too low.  
But admitting Mr. Pownal&#x27;s estimate to be just,  
the numbers have grown, since 1 774, fomuch, not­  
withftandingthewar, and the interruption of mi­  
grations from Europe, that they mult be well nigh  
three millions.—lf the calculation made by the  
members of Congress was right, the numbers now  
mull be nearer four millions, than three millions  
and an half.  
I have observed to you in a former letter, that  
the Maflachufetts Bay has been lately numbered,  
and found to have increased in numbers as much  
as ill former periods, very nearly.  
I now add, that Delaware, which in 1774 was  
estimated at 30,000, upon numbering the people  
since, they appeared to be 40,000.  
Pennsylvania is undoubtedly set too low in both  
estimates.  
I have the honor to be, very refpe&lt;ftfully, &amp;c.  
JOHN ADAMS
