s the mouth of the Mississippi, as we possibly could. We also thought it advisable to impress Britain with a strong sense of the importance of the navigation of that river, to their future commerce on the interior waters from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to that of the Mississippi, and thereby render that court averse to any stipulations with Spain to relinquish it. These two objects militated against each other, because to inhance the value of the navigation, was also to inhance the value of the countries contiguous to it; and thereby disincline Britain to the dereliction of them.

We are officially assured by Mr. Hartley, that positive orders for the evacuation of New-York, have been despatched, and that no avoidable delay will retard that event. Had we proposed to fix a time for it, the British commissioner would have contended that it should be a time posterior to the date of the definitive treaty, and that would have been probably more disadvantageous to us, than as that article now stands.We are surprised to hear that any doubts have arisen in America respecting the time when the cessation of hostilities took place there. It most certainly took place at the expiration of one month after the date of that declaration, in all parts of the world, whether land or sea, that lay north of the latitude of the Canaries.The ships afterwards taken from us, in the more northerly latitudes, ought to be reclaimed and given up. We shall apply to Mr. Hartley on this subject and also on that of the transportation of negroes from New-York, contrary to the words and intention of the provisional articles.
