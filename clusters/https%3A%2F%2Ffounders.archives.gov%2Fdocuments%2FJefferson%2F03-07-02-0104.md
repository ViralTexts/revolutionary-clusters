Dear Sir  Monticello Jan. 31. 14.  
Your favor of the 23d is recieved. Say had come to hand safely. but I regretted having asked the return of him; for I did not find in him one new idea on the subject I had been contemplating; nothing more than a succinct, judicious digest of the tedious pages of  
			 Smith.  
You ask my opinion on the question whether the states can add any qualifications to those which the Constitution has prescribed for their members of Congress? it is a question I had never before reflected on; yet had taken up an off-hand opinion, agreeing with your first, that they could not: that to add new qualifications to those of the  
			 Constitution, would be as much an alteration as to detract from them.  
			 and so I think the House of  Representatives of Congress decided in some case; I believe that of a member from Baltimore. but your letter having induced me to look into the Constitution, and to consider the question a little, I am again in your predicament of doubting the correctness of my first opinion. had the constitution  
			 been silent, nobody can doubt but that the right to prescribe all the qualifications and disqualifications of those they would send to represent them would have belonged to the state. so also the  
			 constitution might have prescribed the whole, and excluded all others. it seems to have preferred the middle way. it has exercised the power in part, by declaring some disqualifications, to wit,  
			 those of not being 25. years of age, of not having been a citizen 7. years, and of not being an inhabitant of the state at the time of election. but it does not declare itself that the member  
			 shall  
			 not be a lunatic, a pauper, a convict of treason, of murder, of felony, or other infamous crime, or a non-resident of his district: nor does it prohibit to the state the power of declaring these  
			 or  
			 any other disqualifications which it’s particular circumstances may call for: and these may be different in different states. of course then, by the 10th Amendment, the power is reserved to the state. if, wherever the constitution assumes a single power out of many which belong to the same subject, we should consider it as assuming the  
			 whole, it would vest the general government with a mass of powers never contemplated. on the contrary the assumption of particular powers seems an exclusion of all not assumed. this reasoning  
			 appears  
			 to me to be sound; but, on so recent a change of view, caution requires us not to be too confident, and that we admit this to be one of the doubtful questions on which honest men may differ with  
			 the  
			 purest motives; and the more readily as we find we have differed from ourselves on it.  
  
I have always thought that where the line of demarkation between the powers of the general &amp; state governments was doubtfully or indistinctly drawn, it would be prudent and praise-worthy in both parties never to approach it but under the most urgent necessity. is the necessity now urgent to declare that no non-r

Sir* . You ask my opinion on the  
question, whether the States can add  
any qualifications to thofe which  
the Constitution has prescribed for  
their members of Congress? It is a  
question I had never before reflected  
on; yqt had taken up an off-hand  
opinion that the}&#x27; could not. That  
to add new qualifications to those of  
the Constitution, would he as much  
an alteration as to detract from them.  
And so I think the House decided  
in some ease; I believe that a mem­  
ber from Baltimore. But your letter  
having induced me to look into the  
Constitution and to consider the  
question a little, I am again in your  
predicament, of doubting the cor­  
rectness of my first opinion. Had  
the Constitution been silent, nobody  
can doubt but that the right to pre­  
scribe all the qualifications and dis­  
qualifications of those they would  
send to represent them, would have  
belonged to the State. So also the  
Constitution might have prescribed  
the whole and excluded all others.  
It seems to have preferred the mid­  
dle way. It has exercised the power  
in part, by declaring some disqual­  
ifications. But it does not declare,  
itself, that the member shall not be  
a lunatic, a convict of murder or a  
non-resident of his district. Nor  
docs it prohibit to the State the  
power o!‘ declaring these, or any  
other, disqualifications which its  
particular circumstances may call  
tor; and these may be different in  
different States. Ot course, then, by  
the tenth amendment, the power  
is reserved to the State. If,  
whenever the Constitution assumes  
a single power out of many which  
belong to same subject, we should  
consider it as assuming the whole it  
would vest the General Government  
with a mass of powers never contem  
plated. On the contrary, the as  
sumption of particular powers seems  
an exclusion of all not assumed.  
This reasoning appears to me to be  
sound; but, on so recent a change of  
view, caution requires us not to he  
too confident, and we admit this to  
be one of the doubtful questions on  
which honest men may differ with  
the purest motives, and the more  
readily as we find we have differed  
from oversetves on it
