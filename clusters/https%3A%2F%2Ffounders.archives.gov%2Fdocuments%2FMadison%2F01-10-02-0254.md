uary 1788]  
Having shewn that no one of the powers transferred to the federal government is unnecessary or improper, the next question to be considered is whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous to the portion of authority left in the several states.  
The adversaries to the plan of the convention instead of considering in the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary for the purposes of the federal government, have exhausted themselves in a secondary enquiry into the possible consequences of the proposed degree of power, to the governments of the particular states. But if the union, as has been shewn, be essential, to the security of the people of America against foreign danger; if it be essential to their security against contentions and wars among the different states; if it be essential to guard them against those violent and oppressive factions which imbitter the blessings of liberty, and against those military establishments which must gradually poison its very fountain; if, in a word the union be essential to the happiness of the people of America, is it not preposterous, to urge as an objection to a government without which the objects of the union cannot be attained, that such a government may derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual states? Was then the American revolution effected, was the American confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands spilt, and the hard earned substance of millions lavished, not that the people of America should enjoy peace, liberty, and safety; but that the governments of the individual states, that particular municipal establishments might enjoy a certain extent of power, and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the old world that the people were made for kings, not kings for the people. Is the same doctrine to be revived in the new, in another shape, that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to the views of political institutions of a different form? It is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good, the real welfare of the great body of the people is the supreme object to be pursued; and that no form of government whatever, has any other value, than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object. Were the plan of the convention adverse to the public happiness, my voice would be, reject the plan. Were the union itself inconsistent with the public happiness, it would be, abolish the union. In like manner as far as the sovereignty of the states cannot be reconciled to the happiness of the people; the voice of every good citizen must be, let the former be sacrificed to the latter. How far the sacrifice is necessary, has been shewn. How far the unsacrificed residue will be endangered, is the question before us.  
Several important considerations have been touched in the course of these papers, which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the state governments. The more I revolve the subject the more fully I am persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by the preponderancy of the last than of the first scale

.  
We have seen in all the examples of antient and modern confederacies, the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the members to despoil the general government of its authorities, with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the encroachments. Although in most of these examples, the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration, as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the fate of the former; yet as the states will retain under the proposed constitution a very extensive portion of active sovereignty, the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded. In the Ach√¶an league, it is probable that the federal head had a degree and species of power, which gave it a considerable likeness to the government framed by the convention. The Lycian confederacy, as far as its principles and form are transmitted, must have borne a still greater analogy to it. Yet history does not inform us that either of them ever degenerated or tended to

particularly had the local sovereigns possessed the affections of the people, the great kingdoms in Europe, would at this time consist of as many independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons.  
The state governments will have the advantage of the federal government, whether we compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on the other; to the weight of personal influence which each side will possess; to the powers respectively vested in them; to the predilection and probable support of the people; to the disposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures of each other.  
The state governments may be regarded as constituent and essential parts of the federal government; whilst the latter is no wise essential to the operation or organisation of the former. Without the intervention of the state legislatures, the president of the United States cannot be elected at all. They must in all cases have a great share in his appointment, and will perhaps in most cases of themselves determine it. The senate will be elected absolutely and exclusively by the state legislatures. Even the house of representatives, though drawn immediately from the people, will be chosen very much under the influence of that class of men, whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an election into the state legislatures. Thus each of the principal branches of the federal government will owe its existence more or less to the favor of the state governments, and must consequently feel a dependence, which is much more likely to beget a disposition too obsequious, than too overbearing towards them. On the other side, the component parts of the state governments will in no instance be indebted for their appointment to the direct agency of the federal government, and very little if at all, to the local influence of its members.  
The number of individuals employed under the constitution of the United States, will be much smaller, than the number employed under the particular states. There will consequently be less of personal influence on the side of the former, than of the latter. The members of the legislati

lone, we may pronounce the advantage of the states to be decisive. If the federal government is to have collectors of revenue, the state governments will have theirs also. And as those of the former will be principally on the sea-coast, and not very numerous; whilst those of the latter will be spread over the face of the country, and will be very numerous, the advantage in this view also lies on the same side.

er the federal government, the influence of the whole number would not be a comparison with that of the multitude of state-officers in the opposite scale. Within every district, to which a federal collector would be allotted, there would not be less than thirty or forty or even more officers of different descriptions and many of them persons of character and weight, whose influence would lie on the side of the state.  
The powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negociation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected. The powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement and prosperity of the state.  
The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the state governments, in times of peace and security. As the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter, the state governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal government. The more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defence, the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favour their ascendancy over the governments of the particular states.  
If the new constitution be examined with accuracy and candour, it will be found that the change which it proposes, consists much less in the addition of new powers to the union, than in the invigoration of its original powers. The regulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power; but that seems to be an addition which few oppose, and from which no apprehensions are entertained. The powers relating to war and peace, armies and fleets, treaties and finance, with the other more considerable powers, are all vested in the existing congress by the articles of confederation. The proposed change does not enlarge these powers; it only substitutes a more effectual mode of administering them. The change relating to taxation, may be regarded as the most important: and yet the present congress have as compleat authority to require of the states indefinite supplies of money for the common defence and general welfare, as the future congress will have to require them of individual citizens; and the latter will be no more bound than the states themselves have been, to pay the quotas respectively taxed on them. Had the states complied punctually with the articles of confederation, or could their compliance have been enforced by as peaceable means as may be used with success towards single persons, our past experience is very far from countenancing an opinion that the state governments would have lost their constitutional powers, and have gradually undergone an entire consolidation. To maintain that such an event would have ensued, would be to say at once, that the existence of the state governments is incompatible with any system whatever that accomplishes the essential purposes of the union.

ution.‚Äù‚Äî  
The ‚Äú Federalist‚Äù makes the same remark: ‚Äú If the  
constitution be examined with accuracy and can¬≠  
dour, it will be found that the change which it  
proposes, consists much less in the addition of  
new powers to the union, than in the invigora¬≠  
tion of its original, powers. The regulation of  
commerce, it is true, is anew power; but that  
-eem* to be an addition which few oppose, and  
from which no apprehensions are entertained. The  
powers relating to war aud peace, armies and fleetsj  
treaties and finance, with the other more conside¬≠  
rs powers, are ali vested in the existing Congress  
by the articles of confederation. The proposed  
change does not enlarge these powers; it only sub¬≠  
stitutes a more effectual mode of administering  
them,‚Äù Ate.  
The following extract from the same No. of  
the Federalist explains the true character of the  
powers conveyed: t* The powers delegated by the  
propo-ed constitution to the federal government,  
are few and defined. Those which are to remain  
in the sta&#x27;e governments, arc numerous and in¬≠  
definite. The lormer will he exerci-ed prncipally  
on external ohjcc\s,s* war, -pence, negotiation,  
and foreign commerce; with which last the power  
of taxation will lor the most part be couuected.  
The powers reserved to the several states will ex¬≠  
tend to all the objects, which, in the erdinary  
course &#x27;of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, anil  
properties of the people; and the internal order,  
improvement, and prosperity of the stute. The  
operations of the fedeiul goverment will be most  
exten-i ve and important in times of war and dan¬≠  
ger; those of the state governments, in times of  
peace and security.

THE PASSAGKS.  
&quot;The powers dalegated by the proposed con-  
stitution to the Federal Government, are few and  
defined; those which remain to the State Govern.  
ments, are numerous and indefinite.  
The number of individuals employed under the  
constitution of the United States, will be much  
smalter than the number employed under the par-  
ticular States; there will, consequently, be less  
of personal influence on the side of the former  
than of the lalter.

revenue, the State Governments will have theirs  
also; and as those of the former (the United

States.)  
Within every district to which a Federal collector

thirty or forty, or even more officers, of different  
descriptions (in the employmient of the States,)  
and many of them persons of character and weight,

as to the course of many of the States on this

theory of the l ights of the State Legislatures.?  
&quot;The Federalist&quot; holds, that &quot;the Stale Govern¬≠

when a question of transcendant importance to  
the whole Union, and especially to the South,

That Mr. Calhoun is right in supposing that this power,  
is confined to the external and not internal relations of the  
States, is evident from opinions expressed previous to the  
adoption of the constitution and while it was under discus-

In the 45th No. of the Federalist, Mr. Madison says,  
  
‚ÄúThe powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal  
government, are few and defined. ‚ÄòThose which are to remain in the

nicipul establishments, mi  
a certain extent of power, and be  
arrayed with certain dignities and at.¬≠  
tributes of sovereignty? We have  
heard of the impious doctrine in the  
old World, that the people were  
made for kings, not kings for the  
people. Is the same doctrine to be  
revived in the New, in another  
shape, that the solid happiness of the  
people is to be sacrificed to the views  
of the political institutions of a different  
rin? It is too carly for politicians to  
presume on our forgetting that the  
public good--the real welfare of the  
great body of the people,-is the sue¬≠  
preme object to be pursued, and that  
no form of Government whatever, has  
any other value than as it may be  
fitted for the attainment of this olject.  
Were the plan of the Convention  
adverse to the public happiness, my  
voice would be, reject the plan. Were  
the Union itself inconsistent with the  
public happiness, it would be, abolish  
the Union. In like manner, as far as  
the sovereignty of the States cannot  
be reconciled to the happiness of  
the people, the voice of every good  
citizen mnust be, fet the former be  
sacrifieed for the lutter. How far the  
sacrifice is necessary has been shown.  
How far the unsacrificed residue will  
be endangered is the question befor

Under the Con titution, these powers, with some in  
addition, were vested in three distinct departments  
of Government--the Legislative, Judicial and Exec¬≠  
utive. In the 49th number of the Federalist, Mr.  
Madison, speaking of this matter, says:

relating to war and peace, armies and fleets, trea¬≠  
ties and finance, with other more considerable  
powers, are all vested in the existing Congress by  
the articles of confederation. The proposed change  
does not enlarge these powers; it is only substituting a  
more efectual mode of administering them.&quot;

d‚Äô√©tre of the various European nations is the promotion of the  
grandeur and dignity of the reigning houses.  
  
These doctrines are not, as we have said, of recent origin.  
They were broached just as freely, and maintained just as stoutly,  
eighty years ago as now, and the comments made on them at  
that time by Madison possess just as much point to-day as when  
they were uttered : ‚Äî  
  
‚ÄúThe adversaries to the plan of the Convention, instead of considering,  
in the first place, what degree of power was absolutely necessary for the  
purposes of the federal government, have exhausted themselves in a  
secondary inquiry into the possible consequences of the proposed degree  
of power to the governments of the particular States. But if the Union,  
as has been shown, be essential to the security of the people of Amer-  
ica against foreign danger ; if it be essential to their security against  
contentions and wars among the different States ; if it be essential to  
guard them against those violent and oppressive factions which embit-  
ter the blessings of liberty, and against those military establishments  
which must gradually poison its very fountain ; if, in a word, the Union  
be essential to the happiness of the people of America, is it not pre-  
posterous to urge as an objection to a government, without which the  
objects of the Union cannot be attained, that such a government may  
derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual  
States? Was, then, the American Revolution effected, was the Amer-  
ican Confederacy formed, was the precious blood of thousands spilt, and  
the hard-earned substance of millions lavished, not that the people of  
America should enjoy peace, liberty, and safety ; but that the govern-

another shape, that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to  
the views of political institutions of a different form? It is too early  
for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good, the
