upposed that the governing considerations should be the healthiness of the site, the fertility of the neighbouring  country, and it’s centrality to the white population of the whole state: for altho the act authorised &amp; required them to receive any voluntary contributions whether conditional or absolute, which might be offered thro them to the President &amp; Directors of the literary fund, for the benefit of the University, yet they did not consider this as establishing an auction, or as pledging the location to the highest bidder.  
Three places were proposed, to wit Lexington in the County of Rockbridge, Staunton in the County of Augusta, and the Central college in the County of Albemarle: each of these was unexceptionable as to healthiness &amp; fertility. It was the degree of centrality to the white population of the state which alone then constituted the important point of comparison between these places: and the board, after full enquiry &amp; impartial &amp; mature consideration, are of opinion that the central point of the white population of the state is nearer to the central college, than to  either Lexington or Staunton by great &amp; important differences, and all other circumstances of the place in general being favorable to it as a position for an University, they do report the central college in Albemarle to be a convenient &amp; proper part of the State for the University of Virginia.  
2d The board having  thus agreed on a proper site for the University to be reported to the legislature, proceeded to the second of the duties assigned to them, that of proposing a plan for its buildings; and they are of opinion that it should consist of distinct houses or pavilions, arranged at proper distances on each side of a lawn of a proper breadth, &amp; of indefinite extent in one direction at least, in each of which should be a lecturing room with from two to four apartments for the accommodation of a professor and his family: that these pavilions should be united by a range of Dormitories, sufficient each for the accommodation of two Students only, this  provision being deemed advantageous to morals, to order, &amp; to uninterrupted study; and that a passage of some kind under cover from the weather should give a communication along the whole range. It is  supposed that such pavilions on an average of the larger &amp; smaller will cost each about $5,000, each  dormitory about $350,  and Hotels of a single room for a Refectory, &amp; two rooms for the tenant necessary for dieting the students will cost about $3,500 each. The number of these pavilions will depend on the number of Professors, and that of the Dormitories &amp; Hotels on the number of  students to be lodged &amp; dieted. The advantages of this plan are, greater security against fire &amp; infection; tranquillity &amp; comfort to the Professors, and their families thus insulated; retirement to the Students, and the admission of enlargement to any degree to which the institution may extend in future times. It is supposed probable that a building of somewhat more size in the middle of the grounds may be called for in time, in which may be rooms for religious  worship under such impartial regulations as the visitors shall prescribe, for public examinations, for a Library, for the schools of music, drawing, and other associated purposes.

ter the affairs of our Country in all its departments, Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary, and to bear their proper share in the councils of our national Government; nothing, more than education, advancing the prosperity, the power and the happiness of a nation.  
Encouraged therefore by the sentiments of the Legislature, manifested in this statute, we present the following tabular statement of the branches of learning which we think should be taught in the University, forming them into groups, each of which are  within the powers of a single professor.

Some Articles in this distribution of Sciences will need observation  
  
A Professor is proposed for antient Languages, the Latin, Greek and Hebrew, particularly, but these Languages being the foundation common to all the Sciences, it is difficult to foresee what may be the extent of this school. at the same time no greater obstruction to industrious study could be proposed than the presence, the intrusions, and the noisy turbulence of a multitude of small boys: and if they are to be placed here for the rudiments of the Languages, they may be so numerous, that its character &amp; Value as an University, will be merged in those of a Grammar school. It is therefore greatly to be wished, that preliminary schools, either on private or public establishment, could be distributed in districts thro the state, as preparatory to the entrance of Students into the University. The tender age at which this part of education commences, generaly about the tenth year, would weigh heavily with parents in sending their sons to a school so distant as the Central establishment would be from most of them. Districts of such extent as that every parent should be within a days journey of his son at school, would be desireable in cases of sickness, and convenient for supplying their Ordinary wants and might be made to lessen sensibly the expence of this part of their education. and where a sparse population would not, within such a compass, furnish subjects sufficient to maintain a school, a competent enlargement of District must, of necessity, there be submitted to. At these District schools or colleges boys should be rendered able to read the easier Authors, Latin and Greek. this would be usefull and sufficient for many not intended for an University education. At these too might be taught English grammar, the higher branches of numerical Arithmatic, the geometry of straight lines and of the circle, the elements of navigation and Geography to a sufficient degree, and thus afford to greater numbers the means of being qualified for the Various Vocations of life, needing more instruction than merely menial or praedial labor; and the same advantages to youths whose education may have been neglected untill too late to lay a foundation in the learned languages. These institutions, intermediate between the Primary schools and the University, might then be the passage of entrance for Youths into the University, where their classical learning might be entirely critically compleated, by a study of the authors of highest degree. And it is at this stage only that they should be recieved at the University—Giving then a portion of their time to a finished knowledge of the latin and Greek, the rest might be appropriated to the modern languages, or to the commencement of the course of science, for which they should be destined. This would generally be about the 15th year of their age when they might go with more safety and contentment to that distance from their parents. Untill this preparatory provision shall be made, either the University will be overwhelmed with the Grammar school or a seperate establishment under one or more ushers for its Lower classes will be adviseable, at a mile or two distance from the general one: where too may be exercised the stricter government necessary for young boys, but unsuitable for youths arrived at years of discretion  
The considerations which have governed the specification of languages to be taught by the professor of modern Languages were that the French is the Language  of general intercourse among nations, and as a depository of human Science is unsurpassed by any other language living or dead: that the Spanish is highly interesting to us, as the Language spoken to by so great a portion of the inhabitants of our Continents, with whom we shall probably have great intercourse ere long; and is that also in which is written the greater part of the early history of America.  
The Italian abounds with works of very superior order, Valuable for their matter, and still more distinguished as models of the finest taste in style and composition: and the German now stands in a line with that of the most learned nations in richness of erudition and advance in the sciences. It is too of common descent with the language of our Own Country, a branch of the same original  Gothic stock, and furnishes Valuable illustrations for us. but in this point of View the Anglo-Saxon is of peculiar Value. We have placed it among the modern languages because it is in fact that which we speak, in the earliest form in which we have knowledge of it. it has been undergoing, with time, those gradual changes which all languages, antient and modern, have experienced: and, even now, needs only to be printed in the modern character and orthography, to be intelligible, in a considerable degree to an English reader. it has this Value too above the Greek and Latin, that while it gives the radix of the mass of our Language, they explain its innovations only. obvious proofs of this have been presented to the modern reader in the disquisitions of Horne Tooke, and Fortescue Aland has well explained the great instruction which may be derived from it towards a full understanding of our Antient common Law on which as a stock our whole System of Law is engrafted. it will form the first link in the  Chains of an historical review of our language through all its successive changes to the present day, will constitute the foundation of that critical instruction in it, which ought to be found  in a Seminary of general learning and thus reward amply the few weeks of attention which would Alone be requisite for its attainment. a language already fraught with all the eminent science of our parent Country the future Vehicle of whatever we may Ourselves achieve atchieve and destined to Occupy so much space on the Globe, claims distinguished attention in American Education—  
Medicine, where fully taught, is usually subdivided into several professorships. but this cannot well be without the accessory of an hospital, where the student  can have the benefit of attending clinical lectures &amp; of assisting at operations of surgery. With this accessory, the seat of our university is not yet prepared, either by its population, or by the numbers of poor, who would leave their own houses, and accept of the charities of an hospital. For the present therefore we propose but a single professor for both medicine &amp;  anatomy. By him the elements of medical science may be taught, with a history &amp; explanations of all it’s successive operations theories from Hippocrates to the present day: and anatomy may be fully treated. Vegetable pharmacy will make a part of the botanical course, &amp; mineral &amp; chemical pharmacy, of those of mineralogy &amp; chemistry. This degree of medical information is such as the mass of scientific students would wish to possess, as enabling them, in their course thro life, to estmate estimate with satisfaction the extent &amp; limits of the aid to human life &amp; health, which they may understandingly expect from that art: and it constitutes such a foundation for those intended for the profession, that the finishing course of practice at the bedsides of the sick, and at the operations of surgery in a hospital, can  neither be long nor expensive. To seek this finishing elsewhere, must therefore be submitted to for a while.  
In conformity with the principles of our constitution, which places all sects of religion on an equal footing, with the jealousies of the different sects in guarding that equality from encroachment &amp; surprise, and with the sentiments of the legislature in favor of freedom of religion manifested on former occasions, we have proposed no professor of Divinity: and the rather, as the proofs of the being of a god, the creator, preserver, &amp; supreme ruler of the universe, the author of all the relations of morality, &amp; of the laws &amp; obligations these infer, will be within the province of the professor of ethics; to which adding the developements of these moral obligations, of those in which all sects agree with a knolege of the languages, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, a basis will be formed common to all sects. proceeding thus far without offence to the constitution, we have thought it proper at this point, to leave every sect to provide as they think fittest, the means of further instruction in their own peculiar tenets.  
We are further of opinion that, after declaring by law that certain sciences shall be taught in the university,  fixing the number of professors they require, which we think should at present, be ten, limiting (except as to the professors who shall be first engaged in each branch) a maximum for their salaries, (which should be a certain but moderate subsistence,  to be made up by liberal tuition fees, as an excitement to assiduity,) it will be best to leave to the discretion of the visitors, the grouping of these sciences together, according to the accidental qualifications of the professors; and the introduction also of other branches of science, when enabled by private donations, or by public provision, and called for by the encrease of population, or other change of circumstances; to establish beginnings,  in short, to be developed by time, as those who come afterwards after us shall find expedient. They will be more advanced than we are, in science and in useful  arts, and will know best what will suit the circumstances of their day.  
We have proposed no formal provision for the gymnastics of the school, altho a proper object of attention for every institution of youth. These exercises with antient nations, constituted the principal part of the education of their youth. Their arms and mode of warfare rendered them severe in the extreme. Ours on the same correct principle, should be adapted to our arms &amp; warfare; and the manual exercise, military maneuvres, and Tactics generally, Should be the frequent exercises of the students, in their hours of recreation. It is at that age of aptness,  docility &amp; emulation of the  practices of manhood, that such things are soonest learnt, and longest remembered. The use of tools too in the manual arts is worthy of encouragement, by facilitating, to such as choose it, an admission into the  neighbouring workshops. To these should be added the arts, which embellish life, dancing music &amp; drawing; the last more especially; as an important part of military education. These innocent arts furnish amusement &amp; happiness to those who, having time on their hands, might less inoffensively employ it; needing, at the same time, no regular incorporation with the institution, they may be left to accessory teachers, who will be paid by the individuals employing them; the university only providing proper apartments for their exercise.  
The 5th duty prescribed to the commissioners is to propose such general provisions as may be properly enacted by the legislature, for the better organising &amp; governing the university.  
In the education of youth, provision is to be made for 1. tuition. 2. diet. 3. lodging. 4. government. and 5. honorary excitements. The 1st of these constitutes the proper functions of the professors. 2. the dieting of the students should be left to private boarding houses, of their own choice, and at their own expense; to be regulated by the visitors from time to time, the house only being provided by the university within its own precincts, and thereby of course subjected to the general regimen, moral or sumptuary, which they shall prescribe. 3. They should be lodged in dormitories, making a part of the general system of buildings. 4. The best mode of government for youth in large collections, is certainly a desideratum not yet attained with us. It may well be questioned whether fear, after a certain age, is the motive to which we should have ordinary recourse. The human character is susceptible of other incitements to correct conduct, more worthy of employ, and of better effect. Pride of character, laudable ambition, &amp; moral dispositions are innate correctives of the indiscretions of that lively age; and when strengthened by habitual appeal &amp; exercise, have a happier effect on future character, than the degrading motive of fear; hardening them to disgrace, to corporal punishments, and servile humiliations, cannot be the best process for producing erect character. The affectionate deportment between father &amp; son offers in truth the best example for that of tutor &amp; pupil; and the experience &amp; practice of  
*a police exercised by the students themselves, under proper direction, has been tried with success in some countries, and the rather as forming them for initiation into the duties and practices of civil life.  
other countries in this respect, may be worthy of enquiry &amp; consideration with us. It will be then for the wisdom &amp; discretion of the visitors to devise &amp;

k they should moreover be charged with the erection, preservation &amp; repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds, &amp; appurtenances and of the interests of the university generally: that they should have power to appoint a Burser, employ a Proctor &amp; all other necessary agents; to appoint &amp; remove professors, two thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal: to prescribe their duties &amp; the course of education, in conformity with the law:  to establish rules for the government &amp; discipline of the students not contrary to the laws of the land: to regulate the tuition fees, &amp; the rent of the dormitories they occupy: to prescribe &amp; control the duties &amp; proceedings of all officers, servants &amp; others with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances &amp; other property &amp; interests of the university: to draw from the literary fund such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution: and in general to direct &amp; do all matters &amp; things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of the said institution; which several functions they should be free to exercise in the form of bye laws, rules, resolutions, orders, instructions or otherwise as they should deem most proper.  
That they should have two stated meetings in the year, and occasional meetings at such times as they should appoint, or on a special call with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule; which meetings should be at the university; a majority of them constituting a quorum for business; and that on the death or resignation of a member, or on his removal by the President &amp; Directors of the Literary fund, or the executive or such other authority as the legislature shall think best, such President &amp; Directors or the Executive, or other authority shall should appoint a successor.  
That the said visitors should appoint one of their own body to be rector &amp; with him, be a body corporate, under the style &amp; title of the Rector &amp; visitors of the University of Virginia, with the right as such, to use a common seal: that they should have capacity to plead &amp; be impleapleaded impleaded, in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be the subjects of legal cognizance &amp; juridiction jurisdiction; which pleas should not abate by the determination of their office, but should stand revived in the name of their successors; and they should be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions &amp; donations, real &amp; personal, as well from bodies corporate, or persons associated, as from private individuals.  
And that the said Rector &amp; Visitors should at all times conform to such laws, as the legislature may from time to time think proper to enact for their government; and the said University should in  all things, &amp; at all times be subject to the controul of the legislature—  
And lastly the Commissioners report to the Legislature the following conditional offers to the President and Directors of the Literary fund for the benefit of the University.  
On the condition that Lexington, or its vicinity shall be selected as the site of the University, and that the same shall be permanently established there within two years from the date, John Robinson of Rockbridge County, has executed a deed to the President &amp; Directors of the Literary fund, to take effect at his death for the following tracts of Land, to wit,  
400 acres on the north fork of James River known by the name of Hart’s bottom purchased of the late General Bowyer  
171 acres adjoining the same purchased of James Griggsby  
203 acres joining the last mentioned tract, purchased of William Paxton  
112 acres lying on the north river above the lands of Arthur Glasgow conveyed to him by William Paxton’s heirs.  
500 acres joining the lands of Arthur Glasgow, Benjamin Cambden, and David Edmondson.  
545 acres lying in Pryor’s gap conveyed to him by the heirs of William Paxton deceased.  
260 acres lying in  Childers gap purchased from of William Mitchell  
300 acres lying also in Childer’s gap purchased of Nicholas Jones  
500 Acres lying on Buffalo, joining the lands of James Johnstone  
340 acres on the Cowpasture river conveyed to him by General James Breckenridge, reserving the right of selling the two last mentioned tracts, and converting them into other lands contiguous to Hart’s bottom, for the benefit of the University.  
Also the whole of his Slaves amounting to 57 in number.  
One Lot of twenty two acres joining the town of Lexington to pass immediately, on the establishment of the University, together with all the personal estate of every kind; subject only to the payment of his debts, and fulfilment of his contracts.  
It has not escaped the attention of the Commissioners that the deed referred to is insufficient to pass the estate in the lands intended to be conveyed, &amp; may be otherwise defective; but if necessary this defect may be remedied before the meeting of the Legislature which the Commissioners are advised will be done.  
The board of Trustees of Washington College have also proposed to transfer the whole of their  funds, viz,  
100 shares in the funds of the James River company.  
31 acres of land on which all their buildings stand.  
Their philosophical apparatus; their expected interest in the funds of the Cincinnati society: the Libraries of the Graham and Washington societies; and 3000 dollars in cash, on condition that a reasonable provision be made for the present Professors.  
A subscription has also been offered by the people of Lexington and its vicinity amounting to 17,878 dollars; all which will appear from the deed and other documents, reference thereto being had.  
In this case also, it has not escaped the attention of the Commissioners, that questions may arise as to the power of the Trustees to make the above transfers.  
On the condition that the central College shall be made the site of the University, its whole property real &amp; personal in possession, or in action is offered. This  consists of a parcel of land of 47 acres whereon the buildings of the College are begun, one pavilion and its appendix of dormitories, being already far advanced, and with one other pavilion, &amp; equal annexation of dormitories, being expected to be compleated during the present season. Of another parcel of 153 acres near the former, and including a considerable eminence very favorable for the erection of a future observatory.  Of the proceeds of the sales of two Glebes amounting to 3,280 dollars 86 cents; and of a subscription of 41.248 dollars on papers in hand, besides what is on outstanding papers of unknown amount, not yet returned. Out of these sums are to be taken however, the cost of the lands, of the buildings, and other  works done, and for existing contracts.  
For the conditional transfer of these to the President &amp; Directors of the literary fund, a regular power signed by the Subscribers and founders of the College generally; has been given to its Visitors and Proctor, and a deed conveying the said property accordingly, to the President and Directors of the literary fund has been duly executed by the said Proctor, and acknowledged for record in the Office of the Clerk of the County court of Albemarle  
Signed and certified by the members present, each in his proper handwriting this 4th day of August 1818.

A professor is proposed for anei tit  
languages, the Latin, (ireck ami Hebrew  
particularly. But these languages hi ing  
the foundation common to all the scien­  
ces, it is difficult to foresee wltat may be  
the extent of this school. At the same  
time, no greater obstruction to industri­  
ous study could be proposed than tiie  
presence, the intrusions and the noisy  
turbulence of a multitude ol small buys;  
and if they are to be placed here for llu*  
rudiments of lire languages, tlicy may be  
so numerous that ils cbaraclcrand value,  
as an university, will lie merged in those  
of a grammar school. It is, therefore,  
greatly to lie wished, tlr.it preliminary  
school*, cither on private or public estuh­  
isli incuts, could In-distributed indistricls  
thro’ tin-state, as preparatory to the en­  
trance of students into the university.—  
Tin* t. ud i age at which this part of edu­  
cation coin indices, generally about the  
tenth year, would weigh heavily with pa­  
reuis in sending their sons to a school so  
  
(itsiutit as Hie centra! establishment

ol such extent as that every parent should  
be within n (lax’s journey of bis son at  
school, would he desirable in cases of  
sickness, and convenient for supplying  
their ordinary wants, and-might he tirade  
to lessen sensibly the expence oft big part  
of their education. And where a sparse  
population would not, within such a  
compass, furnish subjects sufficient to  
maintain a school, a competent enlarge­  
ment ol district must, of necessity, theie  
ke submitted to. At these district schools  
or colleges, hoys should be rendered able  
to read Iheeusierauthors, Latin and (ireek.  
I Ins would he useful and sufficient for  
many not intended for an university edu­  
cation. At Ihcke too might be taught  
English grammar, the higher branches of  
nuuurica! arithmetic, the geometry of  
straight lines and ol the circle, the ele­  
ments ol navigation and geography to a  
sufficient degree,and thus afford to great­  
er numbers the means of being qualified  
lor the various vocations of life, needing  
more instruction than merely menial or  
praeiliai labor, and the same advantages  
to y oaths w hose education muv Itax e been  
neglected until too late to lay a fouuda­  
tion in the learned languages. These in­  
stitutions, intermediate* between tt;e pri­  
mary schools and university, might then  
he the passage of entrance for youths into  
the uuiveisity, where their classical learn­  
ing might he ethically completed, by a  
study of llte authors of highest degree ;  
and jlis al this stage only that they should  
be received at the university. Giving  
then a portion of their time to :t finished  
knowledge of Ihe Latin and Greek, the  
rest might be appropriated to the modern  
languages, or to the commencement of  
the course of science for which they  
should he destined. &#x27;This would gene­  
rally he about the loth year of their age,  
«hen they might gowith more safety and  
contentment l&lt;» that distance from their  
parents. Untd this preparatory prov isioit

lor young hoys, hut unsuitable Ibr youths  
arrived at years of discretion.  
I Ik* considerations which have govern­

«&gt;; general intercourse among nations, and  
as i|« pository ol liniiian science, is un­  
surpassed bv any oilier language, living  
or dead ; llwit the Spanish is highly inte­  
resting to us, a* the language spoken by  
so great a portion of the inhabitants of  
our continents, wit li whom we shall prob­  
ably have great intercourse ere long, and  
is that also in which is written the great­  
er part ot 1 lie earlier history of America :  
the Italian abounds with works of very  
superior order, valuable (or their mallei,  
and still more distinguish! d as models ol  
the finest taste ill style and composition;  
Bud the German now stands in a line with  
that ot the most learned nalioiisin richness  
ot erudition and advance in the sciences.  
It is too of common descent with the lan­  
guage of our own country, a branch of  
the same original Gothic stock, and fur­  
nishes valuable illustrations lor us. Hpt  
in this point of&#x27;view, the Anglo-Saxon is  
of peculiar value. We have placed it a*  
mong lho&#x27; modern language-, because it  
is in fact that which we speak, in the ear­  
liest form in which we have knowledge of  
it. It has been undergoing, with lime,  
those gradual changes which ail langua­  
ges, ancient and modern, have expo; kne­  
ed ; and even now needs only to be pi iol­  
rd in the modern character and orthogra­  
phy to he intelligible, in a i ousiderahlc  
degree, loan English reader, it ha* tins  
value, too, above the Greek and Latin,  
that, while it gives the ra i\ ol the mass  
ol our language, they explain its innova­  
tions only. Obvious proofs ol this have  
been presented to the modern render  
in the disquisitions of Horn Tooke,  
and Fortcseile Aland has well cxplaiti­  
e I the great instruction which may be  
derived horn it towards a full understand­  
ing ol our ancient common law, on which,  
»■* a ‘•lock, our whole system of law  
is engrafted. It will form the first  
link in the chain ol an historical review of  
our language through all its successive  
Changes to the present day, will coiiati­  
iule the foundation of that critical in­  
Itrilciion in it which ought to he found m  
i seminary ol general learning, and thus  
reward amply Ibe few weeks of atlcnti &gt;n, i  
a uidi would alone be requisite forksut­  
aimncnt ; a language already fraught  
■villa all the eminent science «d our parent  
•oiinlrj, the tuliirc vehicl- of whatever i  
vc may ourselves Atchievc, and destined  
  
lo occupy so much space on the glob**,  
claims distinguished attention in Ameri­  
can education.  
Medicine, where fully taught, is usually  
.subdivided into several professorships,  
but this cannot well lie without the ac­  
cessory of an hospital, where the student  
can have the benefit of attending clinical  
, lectures, and of assisting at operations ol  
surgery. With this accessory, the s*\it  
of our university is not yet prepared, ci­  
ther by its population, or by tin&#x27; numbers  
of poor who would leave their own hou­  
ses, nnd accept of the cliaritics-ol an hos­  
pital. For tiie present, there hue, we pro­  
pose hut a single professor for both medi­  
cine and anatomy. J»y him the elements  
«l medical science may he taught, with a  
history and explanations ot all its succes­  
sive lli. oiio Iroiu Hippocrates lo the pre­  
sent day : and anatomy may he fully  
Heated. Vegetable pharmacy will make a  
part ot the botanical course, and mineral  
ami chemical pharmacy of those ot min­  
eralogy ami chemistry. This degree of  
medical information is such as flic mass  
of scientific students would wish fo pos­  
sess, as enabling them, in their course  
through life, to estimate with satisfaction  
the extent and limits ot the aid to human  
life ami health, which they may ninler­  
stamliugly expect from that art ; and it  
constitutes such a foundation for those  
intended for the profession, that the fin­  
ishing course of practice at the bedsides  
ol the sick, and at the operations ot sur­  
gery in a hospital, can neither be lung nor  
expensive. To seek this tiuishiog else­  
where, must therefore be submitted to for  
a while.  
In conformity with the principles of  
our constitution, which places all sects of  
religion on an equal footing, with th*1 jea­  
lousies of 1 lie ditfereiit sects in guarding  
• hat equality from encroachment and sur­  
prise, ami with I In* sentiments of the legis­  
lature in tavor of freedom of religion,  
in a n i tested on former occasions, we have  
proposed no professor of divinity ; and  
the rather as the proofs of the being of n  
(iod, the creator, preserver, and supreme  
ruler ot thu universe, Hie author of all the  
iclatioiis of morality, and of the laws amt  
obligations these infer, will he within the  
province of the nndessor of ethics: lo  
  
&quot; Inch adding the developemeuts of these  
moral obligations, of those in which all  
sects agree, with a ktiowlege of the langua­  
ges, Hebrew,Greek ami Latin, a basis will  
be formed common to all sects. Proceed­  
ing finis tar without offence to thecousti­  
luiion, we have lliouglit it proper at ibis  
point, to leave every sect to provide, as  
they think fittest, the means of further in­  
stmetion in their own peculiar tenets.  
We are further of opinion, that after  
declaring hy law that certain sciences  
shall he taught in the university, fixing  
the number of professors they require,  
which we think should, at present, be ten,  
limning (except as to the professors who  
shall he first engaged in each branch) a  
maximum for their salaries (which should  
he a certain, hut moderate subsistence, to  
be made up hy liberal tuition fees, as an  
excitement to assiduity) it will be best to  
leave to the discretion of (lie visitors the  
grouping of these sciences together, ac­  
cording to the accidental qualification? of  
the professors; and the introduction also  
of oilier branches of science, when ena­  
bled by private donations, or by public  
provision, and called for hy the increase  
of population, or other change of circum­  
stances; to establish beginnings in short,  
to he developed hy time,asthosp.whoconie  
after us shall find expedient. They will he  
more advanced than we are in science and  
in useful arts, and will know best what  
will suit the circumstances of their day.  
We have proposed no formal provision  
for the gymnastics of the school, although  
a proper object of attention for every in­  
stitution of youth. These exercises with  
aiiticnt nations, constituted the principal  
part ol the education of their youth.—  
I&#x27;heir arms and mode of warfare rendered  
fbein severe in the extreme : ours, on the j  
same correct principle, should b adapt- i  
i&#x27;ll to our arms and warfare ; and the  
manual exercise, military mnmeuvri s,and  
tactics generally, should he the frequent  
exercises of the students, in their hours  
of reci eat ion. It is at tl at age of aptness,  
docility and emulation of the practices ot  
manhood that such things are soonest  
learnt, and longest remembered. The  
use of tools too in the manual arts is wor­  
thy ol encouragement, hy facilitating to  
such as choose it an admission into the  
neighboring workshops. To these should  
  
I#* 1J III* &lt;1| 1&gt; VI nil&#x27;ll C&#x27;lUIH Ill&#x27;ll llir,  
(laming, music, and drawing; tlie last  
more especially, as an important part of  
military education. These innocent arts  
tiiruish amusement and happiness to those  
who, haying time on their hands, might  
l&gt; ss inoffensively employ it. Needing, at  
the same time, no regular incorporation  
with the institution, they may he left to  
accessory teachers, who will he paid by  
the individuals employing them, the uni­  
versity only providing proper apartments  
for their exercise.  
The frill duty prescribed to the commis­  
sioners is to propose such general provi­  
sions as may he properly enacted by the  
legislature, for the belter organising and  
governing the university.  
In tin* edu atinn nt youth provision is to  
be made Ibr, I. tuition, 2, diet, :i, lodging,  
t, government, and fi, honorary excite­  
ments. The 1st of these constitutes the  
proper functions oftlio professors. &#x27;2, the  
dieting of the students should be led to  
private boarding houses of their own  
choice, and at their own expense ; to he  
regulali &lt;1 by the visitors from time to  
time, the house only being provided by  
the university within its own precincts,  
and thereby of course subjected to the  
general regimen, moral or sumptuary,  
which they shall prescribe. 0, they shouid  
he lodged in dormitories, making a part  
of the general system of buildings. 4, flic  
best mode of government for youth, in ■  
large collect ions, is certainly a desidera- i  
turn not yet attained with u». It may well i  
be questioned whether f»«r, after a cer- I  
tain, age is the motive to which we should I  
have ordinary recourse. The human clia- i  
racier is susceptible of nth.er incitements l  
to correct conduct, more worthy of em- \
plov. and of better effect. Pride of charac- |  
ier, laudable ambition, and moral dispo- t  
silions are innate correctives of the indis- y  
cretions of that lively age; and when t  
strengthened by habitual appeal and ex- &lt;  
ei&#x27;cisc, have a happier effect on future  
character Ilian tVe degrading motive of c  
b ar. Hardening them to disgrace, to cor- i  
l&gt;oral punishments, and servile liuniilia- I  
lions cannot be the best process lor pro- I  
fin ing erect character. The affectionate t  
leporlment between father and soil offers ri  
it truth the best example lor Ifiat of tutor c  
uni pupil; arid the experience and prac­  
ticc of* other countries, in this respect, |&lt;  
nay be worthy of enquiry and considcra- v  
ion with us. It will be thou for the wis- I

nent, with whom we shall probably have  
great intercourse ere long; and is that also in which is written the  
greater part of the early history of America: The Italian abounds  
with works of very superior order, valuable for their matter, and  
still more distinguished as models of the finest taste in style and  
composition: and the German now stands in a line with that of the  
most learned nations in richness of erudition, and advance in the  
sciences. It is too of common descent with the language of our  
own country, a branch of the same original Gothic stock, and fur-  
nishes valuable illustrations for us. But in this point of view, the  
Anglo-Saxon is of peculiar value. We have placed it among the  
modern languages, because it is in fact that which we speak, in  
the earliest form in which we have knowledge of it. It has been  
undergoing, with time, those gradual changes which all languages,  
ancient and modern, have experienced; and even now, needs only  
to be printed in the modern character and orthography, to be in-  
telligible, in a considerable degree, to an English reader. It has  
this value too above the Greek and Latin, that while it gives the  
radix of the mass of our language, they explain its innovations  
only. Obvious proofs of this have been presented to the modern  
reader, in the disquisitions of Horne Tooke; and Fortescue Aland  
has well explained the great instruction which may be derived  
from it towards a full understanding of our ancient common law,  
on which as a stock, our whole system of law is engrafted. It will  
form the first link in the chain of an historical review of our lan-  
guage, through all its successive changes, to the present day; will  
constitute the foundation of that critical instruction in it, which  
ought to be found in a seminary of general learning; and thus re-  
ward amply the few weeks of attention which would alone be re

[county of Albemarle. Each of these was unexcep-  
tionable as to healthiness and fertility—It was the  
degree of centrality to the white population of the  
state which alone then constituted the important  
point of comparision between these places; and the  
board, #fter full enquiry and impartial and mature  
consideration, are of opinion that the central point  
of the white population of the state is nearer to the  
Central College than to either Lexington or Staun-  
ton, by great and inportant differences, and all other  
circumstances of the place in general being favor-  
able to it asa position for an university they do re-  
port the Central College in Albemarle to be a con-  
venient and proper part of the state for the university  
of Virginia.  
  
2. The board having thus agreed on a proper  
site for the university, to be reported to the legis-  
lature, proceeded to the 2d of the duties assigned  
to them, that of proposing a plan for its buildings;  
and they xre of opinion that it should consist of  
distinct houses or pavilions, atranged at proper  
distances on each side of a lswn of a proper breadiht  
and of indefinite =«xtent in one direciion at least,  
in each of which should be a lecturing room with  
‘from two to four apartments for the accommoda-  
‘tion of a professor and his family: ‘hat these pa-  
vilions should be united by a range of do-miiories,  
sufficient each for the accommodation of two stu-  
| dents only, this provision being deemed a:vanta-  
| Seous to morals, to order and to uninterrupted  
istudy; and that a passage of some ki:d, under  
|cover from the weather, should give « communi-  
|cation along the whole range. I* is supposed that  
such pavilions, on an average of the larger and  
‘smaller, will cost each about $5000, each dormi-  
jtory, about $350, and hotels of a single room for  
‘a refectory, and two rooms for the tenants, neces-  
sary for dieting the students, wili cost aboui $3,500  
each. The number of these pavilions will depend  
on the number of professors; and that of the dor-  
mitories and hotels, on the number of students to  
The «advantages of this  
  
  
  
tranquility and comfort to the professors, and their  
_familles thus insulated, retirement to the s&#x27;ndents,  
and the admission of eniargement to any degree to  
‘which the jnstitution may extend in future times,  
  
It is supposed probable that a building of some-  
‘what more size in the middle of the growids may

greatly to be wished, that preliminary schools,  
‘either on private er public establishments, could

puratory to the entrance of students into the uni-

would weigh heavily with parenis in sending their  
sons to a school so distant as the central establish-  
‘ment would be from most of them. Districts of  
‘such extent as that every parent should be within  
a day’s journey of his son at s¢hool, would be desir-  
able in cises of sickness, and convenient for sup-  
plying their ordinary wants, and might be made to

university will. be overwhelmed with the grammar  
school, or a separate establishment, under one or  
more ushers, for its lower classes, will be advisable,  
ata mile or two distant from the general one, wiiere  
too may be exercised the stricte: government neces-  
sary for young boys, but unsuitable for youths ar-  
rived at years of discretion.  
  
The considerations which have governed the  
specification of languages to be taught by the pro-  
fessor of modern languages were, that the French  
is the language of general intercourse among na.  
tions, and as a depository of human science, is un-  
surpassed by any other language, living or dead:  
that the Spanish is highly interesting to us, as the}  
language spoken by so great a portion of the in-  
habi:ants of our continents, with whom we shall  
probably have great intercourse ere long, and is  
that also in which is written the greater part of the  
earlier history of America: the Italian abounds with  
works of very superior order, valuable for their  
matter, and still more disiinguished as models of!  
the finest taste in style and composition; and the  
German now stanas ina line with that of the most  
learned nations io richness of erudiiion and advance  
in the sciences. It is too of common descent with  
the language of our own country, « branch of the  
sime original Gothic stock, and furnishes valuable  
illustrations for us. But in this point of view, the  
Anglo Saxon is of peculiar value. We have pliced  
it among the modern languages, bec.use it is in  
fact that which we speak, in the earliest form in  
which we have knowledge of it. It has been un.  
dergoing, with time, those gradual changes which  
all langu.ges, ancient and modern, have experienced;  
and even uow needs only ‘o be printed in the modern  
character and orthography to be intelligible, in a  
considerable degree, ‘o an English reader. It has  
this value, too, above the Greek and Latin, that,  
while it gives the radix of the mass of our language,  
they explain its innovations only. Obvious proofs  
of this have been presented to the modern reader  
in th- disquisitions of Horn Tooke, and Fortescue  
Aland has well explained the great instruction  
Which may be derived from it towards a full under-  
Standing of our ancient common law, on which, 1s  
a stock, our whole system of law is engrafted. Ih  
will form the first link in the chain of an historical  
review of our language, thro’ all its successive  
changes to the present day; will constitute the  
foundation of that critical instruction in it which  
ought to be found in a seminary of general learning,  
and thus reward amply the few weeks of attention,  
which would alone be requisite for its attainment;  
alanguage already fraught with all the eminent  
science of our parent country, the future vehicle of  
whatever we may ourselves achieve, and destined  
to occupy so much space on the globe, claims dis-  
tinguished attention in American education.  
  
Medicine, where fully taught, is usually subdivid-  
ed into several professorships, but this cannot well  
be without the accessory of an hospit«l, where the  
student can have the benefit of attending clinical  
lectures, and of assisting at operations of surgery.  
With this accessory, the seat of our university is  
not yet prepared, either by its population, or by the  
numbers of poor who would leave their own houses,  
aud accept of the charities of an hospital. For the  
present, therefore, we propose but a single professor  
for both medicine and anatomy. By him the ele-  
ments of medical science may be taught, with a his  
tory and explanations of all its successive theories,  
from Hippocrates to the present day: and anatomy  
may be fully treated. Vegetable pharmacy will  
  
a  
  
and chemical pharm«cy of those of mineralogy and  
chemistry. This degree of medical information 1s  
such as the mass of scientific students would wish  
to possess, as enabling them, in their course through  
life, to estimate with satisf.ction the extent and  
limits of the aid to human life and health, which  
they may understandingly expect from that art: and  
it constitutes such a foundation for those intended  
for the profession, that the finishing course of pric-  
tice at the bedsides of the sick, and at the opera-  
tions of surgery in a hospital, can neiher be long  
nor expensive. Yo seck this finishing elsewhere,  
must therefore be submitted to for a while.  
  
In conformity with the principles of our constitu-  
  
ition, which places all sects of religion on an equal  
  
footiny, with the jealousies of the different sects in  
guarding that equality from encroachment and sur-  
prise, and with the sentiments of the legislature in  
favor of freedom of religion, manifested on former  
occasions, We have proposed no professor of divi-  
nity; and the rather as the proofs of the being of a  
God, the creator, preserver, and supreme ruler of  
the universe, the author of all the relations of  
morslity, and of the laws and obligations these infer,  
will be within the province of the professor of ethics;  
to which adding the developements of these moral  
obligations, of those in which all sects agree, with a  
knowledge of the languages, Hebrew, Greek and  
Lutin, a basis will be formed common to all sects.  
Proceeding thus far without offence to the constitu-  
ion, we have thought it proper at this point, to  
leave every sect to provide as they think fittest, the  
means of fuither instruction in their own peculiar  
lenets.  
  
We are further of opinion, that after declaring  
by law that certain sciences shall be taught in the  
university, fixing the number of professors they re-  
quire, which we think should, at present, be ten,  
limiting (except as to the professors who shall be  
first engaged in each branch) a maximum for their  
salaries (which should be a certain, but moderate  
subsistence, to be made up by liberal tuition fees,  
as anexcitement to assiduity) it will be best to leave  
to the discretion of the visitors the grouping of  
these sciences together, according to the accidental  
qualifications

nocent arts furnish amusement and happiness to  
those who, having time on their hands, might less  
inoffensively employ it. Needing, at the same time,  
no regular incorporation with the institution, they  
may be left to uccessory teachers, who will be paid  
by the individuals employing them, the university  
only providing proper apartments for their exercise.  
  
The 5th duty prescribed to the commissioners 1s  
to propose such general provisions as may be pro-  
perly enacted by the legisl:ture, for the better or-  
Fan Zing and governing the university.  
  
In the education of youth, provision is to be made  
for, 1, wition, 2, diet, 3, lodging, 4, government.  
and 5, honorary exci‘ements. The Ist of these con-  
stitutes the proper functions of the professors: 2,  
the dieting of the students should be left to private  
bouriing houses of their own choice, and at their  
own expense, to be regulated by the visitors from  
tim~ to time, the house only being provided by the  
universi:y within its own precincts, and thereby of  
cours? subjected to the general regimen, moral or  
sumptuary, which they shall prescribe: 3, they  
should be lodged in dormitories, making a part of  
the general system of buildings: 4, the best mode  
of government for youth, in large collections, is  
ceriainly a desideratum not yet attained with us.  
{t may will be questioned whether fear, after a cer-  
tain age, is the motive to which we should have  
ordinary recourse. ‘The human character is susceptt-  
ble of other incitements to correct conduct, more  
worthy of employ, and of better effect. Pride of  
character, laudable ambition, and moral dispositions  
are innate correctives of the indiscretions of that  
lively age; and when strengthened by habitual ap-  
peal and exercise, have a happier effect on future  
character than the degrading motive of fear.—  
Hardening them to disgrace, to corporal punish-  
ments and servile humiliations, cannot be the best  
process for producing erect character. The affec-  
tionate depor:men:

at the head of this article. Among the members of the board  
of commissioners, we observe the names of Messrs. Jefferson  
and Madison, and the Report before us is ascribed to the former  
of these gentlemen, who acted as the president of the board.  
  
The first business of the board was to fix on a site for the  
University. ‘Three places were proposed ; Lexington, in the  
county of Rockbridge; Staunton, in the county of Augusta ;

THE best mode of government for youth,  
in large collections, is certainly a desider-  
atum not yet attained with us. It may well  
be questioned whether fear, after a certain  
age, is a motive to which we should have  
ordinary recourse. The human character is  
susceptible of other incitements to correct  
conduct, more worthy of employ, and of  
better effect. Pride of character, laudable  
ambition, and moral dispositions are innate  
correctives of the indiscretions of that lively  
age; and when strengthened by habitual ap-  
peal and exercise, have a happier effect on  
future character than the degrading motive  
of fear. Hardening them to disgrace....  
can not be the best process for producing  
erect character.—THOMAS JEFFERSON
