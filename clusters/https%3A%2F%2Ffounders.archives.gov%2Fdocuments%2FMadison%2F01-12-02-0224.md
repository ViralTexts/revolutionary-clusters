To prevent these effects he presumed the amendment was intended, and he thought it as well expressed as the nature of the language would admit.

ue; in the sense in which it is true, we have asserted the right sufficiently in what we have done; if we mean nothing more than this, that the people have a right to express and communicate their sentiments and wishes, we have provided for it already. The right of freedom of speech is secured; the liberty of the press is expressly declared to be beyond the reach of this government; the people may therefore publicly address their representatives; may privately advise them, or declare their sentiments by petition to the whole body; in all these ways they may communicate their will. If gentlemen mean to go further, and to say that the people have a right to instruct their representatives in such a sense as that the delegates were obliged to conform to those instructions, the declaration is not true. Suppose they instruct a representative by his vote to violate the constitution, is he at liberty to obey such instructions? Suppose he is instructed to patronize certain measures, and from circumstances known to him, but not to his constituents, he is convinced that they will endanger the public good, is he obliged to sacrifice his own judgment to them? Is he absolutely bound to perform what he is instructed to do? Suppose he refuses, will his vote be the less valid, or the community be disengaged from that obedience which is due from the laws of the union? If his vote must inevitably have the same effect, what sort of a right is this in the constitution to instruct a representative who has a right to disregard the order, if he pleases? In this sense the right does not exist, in the other sense it does exist, and is provided largely for.  
The honorable gentleman from Massachusetts, asks if the sovereignty is not with the people at large; does he infer that the people can, in detached bodies, contravene an act established by the whole people? My idea of the sovereignty of the people is, that the people can change the constitution if they please, but while the constitution exists, they must conform themselves to its dictates: But I do not believe that the inhabitants of any district can speak the voice of the people; so far from it, their ideas may contradict the sense of the whole people; hence the consequence that instructions are binding on the represen

 the other alterations which I had the honor to bring forward before the present congress. I appeal to the gentlemen on this floor who are desirous of amending the constitution, whether these proposed are not compatible with what are required by our constituents; have not the people been told that the rights of conscience, the freedom of speech, the liberty of the press, and trial by jury, were in jeopardy; that they ought not to adopt the constitution until those important rights were secured to them.  
But while I approve of these amendments, I should oppose the consideration at this time, of such as are likely to change the principles of the government, or that ar

in the Declaration of Rights (for such  
are the amendments to the constitu­  
tien) &quot;Nor shall private property be  
taben for publle use without sust  
  
compensation.&quot;  
The amendments to the constitu­  
tion of the United States wore added  
  
for the purpose of defluing as well as  
enforcing a republican form of gov  
ernment, and this one principle was  
as sacred as the rights of conscience,  
the freedom of speech, the liberty of  
the press--which aro the safeguards  
of property as well as liberty. This  
is unquestionably an immunity which  
every citizen of the United States  
clearly has and ought to enjoy, and  
which no state has a right to abridge.  
The fourteenth amendment to the  
constitution of the United States de  
clares in section I  
That &quot;no state shall make or on  
force any law which shall abridge the  
privileges or immunities of citizens  
of the United States.

ment to the Federal Constitution:  
The privilege which is thus protected against  
unfriendly legislation by Congress is almost  
universally regarded not only as highly impor­  
tant, but as being ossential to the very existence  
and pernetuity of free government.&quot;  
&quot;You remember what James Madison said  
in the summer of 1789, when the Federal Con­  
gress met in the city of New York:  
&quot;The right of freedom of speech is secured;  
the liberty of the press is expressly declared to  
be beyond the reach of this Government.&quot;  
&quot;What did the great Hamilton say in 18047  
The real danger to our liberties is not from  
a few provisional troops. The road to tyranny  
will be opened by making dependent Judges, by  
packing juries, by stifling the press, by silencing  
leaders and patriots.&quot;  
&quot;But it is hardly worth while to argue to a  
conmittee of the Legislature of this great State  
in favor of the principle that the freedom of the  
press, the liberty of the press, must be upheld.  
Can any one of you gentlemen read this bill  
and remain of the opinion that it does not re­  
strain the freedom of the press, that it does not
