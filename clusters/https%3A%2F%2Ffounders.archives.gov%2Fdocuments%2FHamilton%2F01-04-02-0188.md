To the People of the State of New-York.  
IN disquisitions of every kind there are certain primary truths or first principles upon which all subsequent reasonings must depend. These contain an internal evidence, which antecedent to all reflection or combination commands the assent of the mind. Where it produces not this effect, it must proceed either from some defect or disorder in the organs of perception, or from the influence of some strong interest, or passion, or prejudice. Of this nature are the maxims in geometry, that “The whole is greater than its part; that things equal to the same are equal to one another; that two straight lines cannot inclose a space; and that all right angles are equal to each other.” Of the same nature are these other maxims in ethics and politics, that there cannot be an effect without a cause; that the means ought to be proportioned to the end; that every power ought to be commensurate with its object; that there ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose, which is itself incapable of limitation. And there are other truths in the two latter sciences, which if they cannot pretend to rank in the class of axioms, are yet such direct inferences from them, and so obvious in themselves, and so agreeable to the natural and unsophisticated dictates of common sense, that they

t this should be the case. Caution and investigation are a necessary armour against error and imposition. But this untractableness may be carried too far, and may degenerate into obstinacy, perverseness or disingenuity. Though it cannot be pretended that the principles of moral and political knowledge have in general the same degree of certainty with those of the mathematics; yet they have much better claims in th

on to them. They are in substance as follow:  
A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care, and to the complete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible; free from every other control, but a regard to the public good and to the sense of the people.  
As the duties of superintending the national defence and of securing the public peace against foreign or domestic violence, involve a provision for casualties and dangers, to which no possible limits can be assigned, the power of making that provision ought to know no other bounds than the exigencies of the nation and the resources of the community.  
As revenue is the essential engine by which the means of answering the national exigencies must be procured, the power of procuring that article in its full extent, must necessarily be comprehended in that of providing for those exigencies.  
As theory and practice conspire to prove that the power of procuring revenue is unavailing, when exercised over the States in their collective capacities, the Federal government must of necessity be invested with an unqualified power of taxation in the ordinary modes.  
Did not experience evince the contrary, it would be natural to conclude that the propriety of a general power of taxation in the national government might safely be permitted to rest on the evidence of these propositions, una

unt to this: “It is not true, because the exigencies of the Union may not be susceptible of limitation, that its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined. Revenue is as requisite to the purposes of the local administrations as to those of the Union; and the former are at least of equal importance with the latter to the happiness of the people. It is therefore as necessary, that the State Governments should be able to command the means of supplying their wants, as, that the National Government should possess the like faculty, in respect to the wants of the Union. But an indefinite power of taxation in the latter might, and probably would in time deprive the former of the means of providing for their own necessities; and would subject them entirely to the mercy of the national Legislature. As the laws of the Union are to become the supreme law of the land; as it is to have power to pass all laws that may be NECESSARY for carrying into execution, the authorities with which it is proposed to vest it; the national government might at any time abolish the taxes imposed for State objects, upon the pretence of an interference with its own. It might alledge a necessity of doing this, in order to give efficacy to the national revenues: And thus all the resources of taxation might by degrees, become the subjects of fœderal monopoly, to the intire exclusion and destruction of the State Governments.”  
This mode of reasoning appears some times to turn upon the supposition of usurpation in the national government; at other times it seems to be designed only as a deduction from the constitutional operation of its intended powers. It is only in the latter light, that it can be admitted to have any pretensions to fairness. The moment we launch into conjectures about the usurpations of the fœderal Government, we get into an unfathomable abyss, and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning. Imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst the labyrinths of an enchanted castle, and knows not on which side to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has so rashly adventured. Whatever may be the limits or modifications of the powers of the Union, it is easy to imagine an endless train of possible dangers; and by indulging an excess of jealousy and timidity, we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism and irresolution. I repeat here what I have observed in substance in another place that all observations founded upon the danger of usurpation, ought to be referred to the composition and structure of the government, not to the nature or extent of its powers. The State governments, by their original constitutions, are invested with complete sovereignty. In what does our security consist against usurpations from that quarter? Doubtless in the manner of their formation, and in a due dependence of those who are to administer them upon the people. If the proposed construction of the Fœderal Government, be found upon an impartial examination of it, to be such as to afford, to a proper extent, the same species of security, all apprehensions on the score of usurpation ought to be discarded.  
It should not be forgotten, that a disposition in the State governments to encroach upon the rights of the Union, is quite as probable, as a disposition in the Union to encroach upon the rights of the State Governments. What side would be likely to prevail in such a conflict, must depend on the means which the contending parties could

But it is evident, that all conjectures of this kind, must be extremely vague and fallible, and that it is by far the safest course to lay them altogether aside; and to confine our attention wholly to the nature and extent of the powers as they are delineated in the constitution. Every thing beyond this, must be left to the prudence and firmness of the people; who, as they will hold the scales in their own hands, it is to be hoped, will always take care to preserve the constitutional equilibrium between the General and the State Governm

As the command of money is necessary for all the operations of

We might here rest our case, satisfied with the conclusion,  
that, in a time of need and peril to the nation, Congress, in  
order to save it, has absolute control over the whole of its re-  
sources, and that no amendment to the Constitution is neces-  
sary, as its framers did not commit the error of setting limits to  
a power ‘destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable  
of limitation.”  
  
Nevertheless, the idea prevails that Congress has no authority

to imagine an endless train of possible dan-  
gers, (could they have imagined worse things  
than have now transpired?) and by indulg-  
ing an excess of jealousy and timidity, we  
may bring ourselves to a state of absolute  
scepticism and irresolution. I repeat here,  
what I have observed in substance in another  
place, that all observation founded upon the  
danger of usurpation ought to be referred to  
the nature of the composition and structure  
of the government, not to the nature or ex-  
tent of its powers. The State Governments,  
by their original Constitutions, are invested  
with complete sovereignty. In what does  
our security consist against usurpations from  
that quarter? Doubtless in the manner of  
their formation, and in due dependence of  
those who are to administer them upon the  
people. If the proposed Constitut.on of the  
Federal Government be found, upon an im-  
partial examination of it, to be such as to  
afford to a proper extent, the same species  
of security, all apprehensions on the score  
of usurpation ought to be discarded.” —[e-  
deralist, No. XXX.  
  
In this passage Mr. Iamilfon places  
the security of the State against the  
dangers of usurpation on the part of  
the General Government, in the sove-  
reiguty of the States, and in the na-

## [AUSTRAL'S NATAL DAY. THE DAWN OF NATIONHOOD](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/169751228)

given as follows: — , &#x27;It is not.true  
thatbeoause the exigenoieB of the Union  
may not be susceptible of {imitation,  
that its power of levying taxes ought to  
be unconfined. Revenue is as requisite  
to the purposes of the local  
administrations as to those of the  
union; and the former are at least of  
equal importance with the latter, to the  
happiness of the people- It is therefore  
as necessary that the State Governments  
should be able to command the means of  
supplying their wants as that the  
national government should possess the  
like faculty, in respect to the wants of  
the union. Eat an indefinite power of  
taxation in the latter might, and  
probably would in time, deprive the  
former of the means of providing for  
their own necessities; and would subject  
them entirely to the mercy of the  
national legislature. As the laws of the  
union are to became the supreme law of  
the land ; as it is to have power to  
pass ail laws that may be necessary for  
carrying into execution the authorities  
with which it iB proposed to vest it,  
the national government might at any &#x27;  
time abolish the taxes imposed for State  
objects, upon the pretence of an  
interference with its own. It might  
allege a necessity of doing this, in  
order to give efficacy to the national  
revenues ; and thus all the resources of  
taxation might, by degrees, become the  
snbjectB of federal monopoly, to the  
entire exclusion and destruction of the  
State Governments.&#x27; Against thi

sources. As the duties of  
superintending the national defence, and  
of securing the public peace against  
foreign or domestic violence, involve a  
provision for casualties and dangers, to  
which no possible limits can bo  
assigned, the power of making that  
provision ought to know no other bounds  
than the exigencies of the nation and  
the resources of the community.&#x27; These  
wero weighty words, and they wero of so  
great importance that evory member ought  
to make himself well acquainted with the  
relations that existed between the  
Supremo Court in America and Congress
