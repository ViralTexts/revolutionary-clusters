[17 June 1788]  
  
  
The importation of slaves until 1808, guaranteed by Article I, Section 9, was attacked by Mason as “a fatal section, which has created more dangers than any other.” Mason said “this infamous traffic” would continue, but those who already owned slaves had “no security for the property of that kind” (Robertson, Virginia DebatesDavid Robertson, Debates and Other Proceedings of the Convention of Virginia (2d  
ed.; Richmond, 1805)., p. 321).  
  
  
Mr. Madison. Mr. Chairman—I should conceive this clause to be impolitic, if it were one of those things which could be excluded without encountering greater evils. The southern states would not have entered into the union of America, without the temporary permission of that trade. And if they were excluded from the union, the consequences might be dreadful to them and to us. We are not in a worse situation than before. That traffic is prohibited by our laws, and we may continue the prohibition. The union in general is not in a worse situation. Under the articles of confederation, it might be continued forever: But by this clause an end may be put to it after twenty years. There is therefore an amelioration of our circumstances. A tax may be laid in the mean time; but it is limited, otherwise congress might lay such a tax as would amount to a prohibition. From the mode of representation and taxation, congress cannot lay such a tax on slaves as will amount to manumission. Another clause secures us that property which we now possess. At present, if any slave elopes to any of those states where slaves are free, he becomes emancipated by their laws. For the laws of the states are uncharitable to one another in this respect. But in this constitution, “no person held to service, or labor, in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.” This clause was expressly inserted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim them. This is a better security than any that now exists. No power is given to the general government to interpose with respect to the property in slaves now held by the states. The taxation of this state being equal only to its representation, such a tax cannot be laid as he supposes. They cannot prevent the importation of slaves for twenty years; but after that period they can. The gentlemen from South-Carolina and Georgia argued in this manner: “We have now liberty to import this species of property, and much of the property now possessed, has been purchased, or otherwise acquired, in contemplation of improving it by the assistance of imported slaves. What would be the consequence of hindering us from it? The slaves of Virginia would rise in value, and we would be obliged to go to your markets.” I need not expatiate on this subject. Great as the evil is, a dismemberment of the union would be worse. If those states should disunite from the other states, for not indulging them in the temporary continuance of this traffic, they might solicit and obtain aid from foreign powers.

Mr. Madison. Mr. Chairman, I should conceive this clause to be  
impolitic, if it were one of those things whieh could be excluded  
Without encountering greater evils. The Southern States would not  
have entered into the Union of America, without the temporary per-  
mission of that trade. And if they were exciuded trom the Union,  
the consequences might be dreadful to them and to us. We are not  
in a worse situation than before. That traffie is prohibited by our  
laws, and we may continue the prohibition. The Union in general is  
not in a worse situation. Under the articles of confederation, it might  
he continued forever: but by this clause an end may be put to it  
after twenty years. There is, therefore, an amelioration of our cireum-  
stances. A tax may be laid in the mean time ; butit is limited, other-  
wise Congress might lay such a tax as would amount to a prohibition.  
From the mode of representation and taxation, Congress cannot lay  
such a tax on slaves as will amount to manumission. Another clause  
secures us that property which we now possess. At present, if any  
slave elopes to any of those States where slaves are free, he becomes

emancipated by their laws. For the laws of the States are uncharita-  
ble to one another in this respect. But in this Constitution, “no  
person held to service, or labor, in one State, under the laws thereof,  
escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation  
therein, be discharged from such service or labor; but shall be deliv-  
ered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be  
due.” This clause was expressly inserted to enable owners of slaves  
to reclaim them. ‘This is a better security than any that now exists.  
No power is given to the general government to interpose with re-  
spect to the property in slaves now held by the States. The taxation  
of this State being equal only to its representation, such a tax cannot  
be lauidas he supposes. ‘They cannot prevent the importation of slaves  
for twenty years; but after that period, they can. The gentlemen  
from South Carolina and Georgia argued in this manner: “ We have  
now liberty to import this species of property, and much of the prop-  
erty now possessed, has been purchased, or otherwise acquired, in  
contemplation of improving it by the assistance of imported slaves.  
What would be the consequence of hindering us from it? The slaves  
of Virginia would rise in value, and we would be obliged to go to  
your markets.” I need not expatiate on this subject. Great as the  
evil is, a dismemberment of the Union would be worse. If those  
States should disunite from the other States, for not including them  
in the temporary continuance of this traflic, they might solicit and  
obtain aid from foreign powers

some other States, objections were raised on the same point.  
And to show that the practice and the theory were alike, there

be excluded without encountering greater evils. The  
Southern States would not have entered into the

isnot in a worse situation. Under the articles of con-

There is, therefore, an amelioration of our circum-

the Union, the consequences might he dreadful  
to them und to us. We are not in a worse  
situation than before. That traffic is prohibited  
hy our laws, and we may continue the prohibition  
The Union in general is not in a worse  
situation. Under the Articles of Confederation  
it might he continued forever; hut hy this  
clause an end may he put to it after twenty  
years. There is, therefore, an amelioration of  
our circumstances. A tax may be laid in the  
mean time; but it is limited, otherwise Congress  
might lay such a tax as would amount to  
a prohibition. From the mode of representation  
and taxation, Congress cannot lay such a  
tax on slaves us will amount to manumission.  
Another clause secures us that property which  
we now possess. At present, if any slave elopes

There are other clauses in the Constitution, sir,

‘At present, if any slave elopes to any of those States  
  
where slaves are free, he becomes emancipated by their |  
  
Jaws. For the laws of the States are uncharitable to one  
another in this respect. But in this Constitution, ‘ no per-  
  
son held to service or labor in one State, under the laws |  
  
thereof, eseaping into another, shall, in consequence of any  
  
law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service |  
or labor; but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to  
whom such service or iabor may be due.’ This clause was  
expressly inserted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim  
them. ‘This is a better security than any that now exists.  
No power is given to the General Government to interpose  
with respect to the property in slaves now held by the States.  
The taxation of this State being equal only to its represent- |  
ation, such a tax cannot be laid as he supposes. They |  
cannot prevent the importation of slaves for twenty years ;  
  
but after that period theycan. The gentlemen from South  
Carolina and Georgia argued in this manner: ‘ We have  
now liberty to import this species of property, and much of  
tke property now poasessed has been purchased or other-  
wise acquired in contemplation of improving it by the as-  
sistance of imported slaves. What would be the conse- |  
quence of hindering us from it? The slaves of Virginia |  
would rise In value, and we would be obliged to go to your |  
markets,’ I need not expatiate on this subject. Great as

claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be

The gentleman evasively says that the word  
laves or slavery nowhere appears in the Con­  
stitution. He surely will not have the temerity  
to say that slaves are not meant in this clause  
of the Constitution. Mr. Madison, who made  
the Constitution, and who, I presume, knew  
as much about its meaning as any of the ia  
lights who set up to interpret it--Mr.  
Madison, in speaking, of this very clause of  
the Constitution, and after citing it, used the  
following language:  
This clause was expressly inserted to enable owners  
of slaves to reclaim them.  
Now, here is the Constitution, plain and  
unmistakable, declaring positively that no  
law or regulation of a State shall be passed  
to discharge slaves--runaway negroes,-escap­  
ing into those States from service, but shall be  
delivered up upon claim of the party to whom  
such service is doe. Let us see how this  
mandate of the Constitution has been carried  
out. The gentleman has had the hardihood to  
say:  
Southern men sometimes complain that the people of  
the free States obstruct the due execution of the fugitive  
slave law, but they are mistaken in this assumption.
