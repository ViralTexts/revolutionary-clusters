Were You But Such a Man as julius Cæsar or the king of Prussia, I should Almost Be sorry for You at the End of the Great tragedy Where You are Acting Such a Part—But With My dear General I Rejoice at the Blessings of a Peace Where our Noble Ends Have Been  
Secured—Remember our Valley forge times, and from a Recollection of Past dangers and labours, We still will Be More pleased at our Present Comfortable Situation—What a Sense of Pride and Satisfaction I feel, When I think of the times that Have determined My Engaging in the  
AmeriCan Cause! As for You, My dear General, Who truly Can Say You Have done all this, What Must Your Virtuous and Good Heart feel on the Happy instance Where the Revolution You Have Made is Now firmly Established—I Cannot But Envy the Happiness of My Grand Children When they  
Will Be about Celebrating and Worshipping Your Name—to Have Had One of their Ancestors Among Your Soldiers, to know He Had the Good fortune to Be the friend of Your Heart, Will Be the Eternal Honour in Which they shall Glory—and to the Eldest of them, as long as My Posterity  
will last, I shall Delegate the favour You Have Been pleased to Confer Upon My Son George.  
At the Prospect of a Peace, I Had prepared to Go to AmeriCa—You know me too Well, My dear General, Not to Be Sensible of the Pleasure I Anticipated in the Hope to Embrace You, and to Be Reunited With My fellow Soldiers—Never did Any thing Please me so much  
as the delightfull Prospect I Had Before me—But on a Sudden I Have Been obliged to differ My darling Plan, and as I Have at Last Been Blessed with a Letter of Yours, I know You Approve of My Lengthtining My furlough Upon Political Accounts—the enclosed Copy of a letter to  
Congress, and My official letter to Mr Livingston Which I Request Him to Communicate to You, Will fully inform You of the Reasons that Urge me to Post off to Madrid—from there, it Will Be Better for me to Go to Paris, and in the Month of june, I will Embark  
for AmeriCa—Happy, ten times Happy will I Be in Embracing My dear General, My father, My Best friend Whom I love with an Affection and a Respect Which I too well feel, Not to know it is impossible for me to Express it.  
in my letters to Congress, You Will Also See that, independant of the Plans I Had Been Permitted to propose to You, in the Execution of Which We Were to Have an immense Naval and Land force, it Had Been at last obtained I should Enter Canada—I Had My Hopes  
to Embrace You at Mont Real, or at least to Be Met there By a detachment from the Army—the Necesity of a diversion Was the Ground Upon Which We Had obtained the King of Spain’s Consent—But Now those schemes are Over, and we Must Rejoice at the Happiness of those You Have  
Rescued from the Hands of British tyranny.  
Now, My dear General, that You are Going to Enjoy some Ease and Quiet, Permit me to propose a plan to you Which Might Become Greatly Beneficial to the Black part of Mankind—Let us Unite in Purchasing a small Estate Where We May try the Experiment to free  
the Negroes, and Use them only as tenants—Such an Example as Yours Might Render it a General Practice, and if We succeed in America, I Will chearfully devote a part of My time to Render the Method fascionable in the West indias—if it Be a Wild scheme, I Had Rather Be Mad that  
Way, than to Be thought Wise on the other tack.

MY DEAR GENERAL: Were you but such a man  
as Julius Casor or the King of Prussia, I should  
almost be sorry for you at the end of the great  
tragedy in which you are acting such a part, but  
with my dear General I rejoice at the blessings of a  
peace where our noble ends have been secured.  
As for you, my dear General, who truly can  
say you have done all this, what must your vir­  
tuous and good heart feel on the happy instant when  
the revolution you have made is now firmly estab­  
lished! I cannot but envy the happiness of my  
grandchildren when they will be about celebrating  
and worshiping your name. To have one of their  
ancestors among your soldiers, to know he had the  
good fortune to be the friend of your heart, will be  
the eternal honor in which they shall glory, and to  
the eldest of them as long as my posterity shall last  
I shall delegate the favor you have been pleased to  
confer upon my son George.  
Happy, ten times happy, shall I be in embracing  
my dear General, my best friend, whom I love with  
an affection and a respect which I too well feel not  
to know it is impossible to me to express it.&quot;
