Dear Sir  Monticello Oct. 24. 23.The question presented by the letters you have sent me is the most momentous which has ever been offered to my contemplation since that of independance that made us a nation; this sets our compass, and points the course which we are to steer thro’ the ocean of time opening on our view. and never could we embark on it under circumstances more auspicious. our first and fundamental maxim should be, never to entangle ourselves in the broils of Europe; our 2d never to suffer Europe to intermeddle in Cis-Atlantic affairs. America, North &amp; South, has a set of interests distinct from those of Europe, and peculiarly her own. she should therefore have a system of her own, separate and apart from that of Europe. while the last is laboring to become the domicil of despotism, our endeavor should surely be to make our hemisphere that of freedom. one nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit, she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. by acceding to her proposition, we detach her from the band of despots, bring her mighty weight into the scale of free government, and emancipate  at one stroke a whole continent, which might otherwise linger long in doubt and difficulty. Great Britain is the nation which can do us the most harm of any one, or all on earth; and with her on our side we need not fear the whole world. with her then we should the most  sedulously nourish a cordial friendship; and nothing would tend more to knit our affections than to be fighting once more side by side in the same cause. not that I would purchase even her amity at the price of taking part in her wars. but the war in which the present proposition might engage us. should that be its consequence, is not her war, but ours. it’s object is to introduce and to establish the American system, of ousting from our land all foreign nations, of never permitting the  powers of Europe to intermeddle with the affairs of our nations. it is to maintain our own principle, not to depart from it. and if, to facilitate this, we can effect a division in the body of the European powers, and draw over to our side it’s most powerful member, surely we should do it. but I am clearly of mr Canning’s opinion, that it will prevent war, instead of provoking it. with Great Britain withdrawn from their scale and shifted into that of our two continents, all Europe combined would not dare to risk war. nor is the occasion to be slighted, which this proposition offers, of declaring our Protest against the atrocious violations of the rights of nations by the interference of any one in the internal affairs of another, so flagitiously begun by Bonaparte and now continued by the equally lawless alliance, calling itself Holy.But we have first to ask ourselves a question. do we wish to acquire to our own Confederacy any one or more of the Spanish provinces? I candidly confess that I have ever looked on Cuba as the most interesting addition which could ever be made to our system of states. the controul which, with Florida point this island would give us over the Gulph of Mexico, and the countries and the Isthmus bordering on it, as well as all those whose waters flow into it, would fill up the measure of our political well-being. yet, as I am sensible that this can never be obtained, even with her own consent, but by war; and as her independance, which is our second interest, and especially  her independance of England, can be secured without it, I have no hesitation in abandoning my first wish to future chances, and accepting it’s independance with peace, and the friendship of England, rather than it’s association, at the expence of war, and her enmity. I could honestly therefore join in the declaration proposed that we aim not at the acquisition of any of those possessions, that we will not stand in the way of any amicable arrangement between them and the mother country: but that we will oppose, with all our means, the forcible interposition of any other power, either as auxiliary, stipendiary, or under any other form or pretext, and most especially their transfer to any power, by conquest, cession, or acquisition in any other way.I should think it therefore advisable that the Executive should encorage the British government to a continuance in the dispositions expressed in these letters, by an assurance of his concurrence with them, as far as his authority goes, and that as it may lead to war, the Declaration of which is vested in Congress, the case shall be laid before them for consideration at their first meeting under the reasonable aspect in which it is seen by himself.I have been so long weaned from political subjects, and have so long ceased to take any interest in them, that I am sensible that I am not qualified to offer opinions on them worthy of any attention. but the question now proposed involves consequences so lasting, and effects so decisive of our future destinies, as to rekindle all the interest I have heretofore felt on these occasions, and to induce me to the hazard of opinions, which will prove my wish only to contribute still my mite in what may be useful to our country, and praying you to accept them at only what they are worth, I add the assurance of my constant and affectionate friendship and respect.Th: Jefferson

quence, is not her war but ours. Its object is to introduce and  
establish the American system, of keeping out of our land all foreign  
powers, of never permitting those of Europe to intermeddle with the  
affairs of our nations. It is to maintain our own principle, and not  
to depart from it: and if to facilitate this we can effect a division  
in the body of the European powers, and draw over to our side its  
most powerful member, surely we should do it. But I am clearly of  
Mr. Canning’s opinion, that it will prevent instead of provoking war.

mental maxim should be, never to entangle our­  
selves in the broils of Europe; our second, never to  
suffer Europe to intermeddle with cis-Atlantic af  
fairs. He then speaks of the proposition of this doe­  
trine as coming from England, and says:  
  
&quot;By acceeding to her proposition, we detach her  
from the bands, bring her mighty weight into the  
scale of free Government, and emancipate a continent  
at one stroke, which might otherwise linger long in  
doubt and difficulty. Great Britain is the nation  
which can do us the most harm of any one, or all on  
earth; and with her on our side we need not fear the  
whole world. With her, then, we should most sedu­  
lously cherish a cordial friendship; and nothing would  
tend more to knit our affections than to be fighting  
once more, side by side in the same cause. Not that  
I would purchase even her amity at the price of  
taking part in her wars. But the war in which the  
present proposition might engage us, should that be  
its consequence, is not her war, but ours. Its object is  
to introduce and establish the American system, of  
keeping out of our land all foreign powers, of never  
permitting those of Europe to intermeddle with the  
affairs of our nations.  
  
It is to maintain our own principle, not to depart  
from it. And if to facilitate this, we can effect a di­  
vision in the body of the European powers, and draw  
over to our side its most powerful member, surely we  
should do it. But I am clearly of Mr. Canning&#x27;s opin­  
ion, that it will prevent instead of provoking war.  
With Great Britain withdrawn from their scale and  
shifted into that of our two continents, all Europe  
combined would not undertake such a war. For how

The Powers of the Old World had their system  
of policy and government. The views promulgated  
by Mr. Monroe, elaborated and slightly extended  
by Mr. Jefferson, were, that it should be a funds­  
mental maxim with the republics of America never  
to embroil themselves with the affairs of Europe  
and never to allow Europe to intermeddle in Amer­

those of Europe, and peculiarly her own; she  
should therefore have a system of her own,  
separate and apart from that of Europe.&quot;

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
* The question presented by the letters you have sent me, is the most momentous  
which has ever been offered to my contemplation since that of independence.  
That made us a nation; this sets our compass, and points the course we are to  
steer through the ocean of time opening on us. Our first fundamental maxim  
should be, never to entangle ourselves in the broils of Europe ; our second,  
never to suffer Europe to intermeddle with cis-atlantic affairs. America, North  
and South, has a set of interests distinct from those of Europe, and peculiarly  
her own; she should, therefore, have a system of her own, separate and apart  
from that of Europe. While the last is laboring to become the domicil of des-  
potism, our endeavor should surely be, to make our hemisphere that of freedom.  
One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit ; she now offers to lead, aid,  
and accompany us in it. By acceding to her proposition, we detach her from  
the band of despots, bring her mighty weight into the scale of free government,  
and emancipate a continent, at one stroke, which might otherwise linger long in  
doubt and difficulty. Great Britain is the nation which can do us the most  
harm if any one, or all, on earth ; and with her on our side, we need not fear the  
whole world. With her, then, we should most sedulously cherish a cordial  
friendship ; and nothing would tend more to knit our affections than to be  
fighting once more, side by side, in the same cause. Not that I would purchase  
even her amity at the price of taking part in her wars; but the war in which  
the present proposition might engage us, should that be its consequence, is not  
her war, but ours. Its object is to introduce and establish the American system,  
of keeping out of our land all foreign powers, and never permitting those of  
Europe to intermeddle with the affairs of our nation. It is to maintain our own  
principle, not to depart from it. And, if to facilitate this, we can effect a divi-  
sion in the body of the European powers, and draw over to our side its most  
powerful member, surely we should do it. But Iam clearly of Mr. Canning’s  
opinion, that it will prevent instead of provoking war. With Great Britain

withdrawn from their scale, and shifted into that of our two continents, all  
Europe combined would not undertake such a war. Nor is the occasion to be  
slighted which this proposition offers of declaring our protest against the attro-  
cious violations of the rights of nations, by the interference of any one in the  
internal affairs of another, so flagitiously begun by Bonaparte, and now continued  
by the equally lawless alliance calling itself holy. But we have first to ask our-  
selves a question. Do we wish to acquire to our own confederacy any one or  
more of the Spanish provinces? I candidly confess that I have ever looked on  
Cuba as the most interesting addition which could ever be made to our system  
of States. The control which, with Florida Point, this island would give us  
over the Gulf of Mexico, and the countries and isthmus bordering on it, as well  
as all those whose waters flow into it, would fill up the measure of our political  
well-being. Yet as I am sensible this can never be obtained, even with her own  
consent, but by war; and its independence, which is our second interest, (and  
especially its independence of England,) can be secured without it, I have no  
hesitation in abandoning my first wish to future chances, and accepting its inde-  
pendence, with peace and the friendship of England, rather than its association,  
at the expense of war and her enmity. I could honestly, therefore, join in the  
declaration proposed, that we aim not at the acquisition of any of those posses-  
sions, that we will not stand in the way of any amicable arrangement between  
them and the mother country ; but that we will oppose, with all our means, the  
forcible interposition of any other power, as auxiliary, stipendiary, or under any  
other form or pretext, and most especially their transfer to any power by con-  
quest, cession, or acquisition in any other way. I should think it, therefore,  
advisable, that the executive should encourage the British government to a con-  
tinuance in the dispositions expressed in these letters, by an assurance of his  
concurrence with them as far as his authority goes ; and that, as it may lead to  
war, the declaration of which requires an act of Congress, the case shall be laid  
before them for consideration at their first meeting, and under the reasonable  
aspect in which it is seen by himself.

491. Mr. Jefferson says: &quot;The question  
presented by the letters you have sent  
me is the most momentous which has  
ever been offered to my contem­  
plation since that of independence. That  
made us a nation; this sets our compas  
and points the course which we are t  
steer through the ocean of time opening on  
us; and never could we embark on it under  
circumstances more auspicious. Our first  
and fundamental maxim should be, never  
to entangle ourselves in the broils of Eu­  
rope. Our second, never to suffer Europe  
to intermeddle with cis-Atlantic affairs.  
America, North and South, has a set of in­  
terests distinct from those of Europe, and  
peculiarly her own. She should, therefore,  
have a system of her own, separate and  
apart from that of Europe. While the last  
is laboring to become the domicile of despote  
our endeavor should surely be to make  
our hemisphere that of freedom. One nation,  
most of all, could disturb us in this  
pursuit; she now offers to lead, aid and ac­  
company us in it. By acceding to her pro  
position, we detach her from the band of de­  
pots, bring her mighty weight into the sale of  
free government, and emancipate a continent  
at one stroke, which might otherwise  
linger long in doubt and difficulty.  
treat Britain is the nation which can  
do us the most harm of anyone, or all on earth;  
and with her on our side, we need not fear the  
whole world. With her, then, we should  
most sedulously cherish a cordial friendship;  
and nothing would tend more to knit our af­  
fections than to be fighting once more, side by  
side, in the same cause. Not that I would pur­  
chase even her amity at the price of taking part  
in her wars. But the war in which the present  
proposition might engage us, should that be  
its consequence, is not her war, but ours. Its  
object is to introduce and establish the Ameri­  
can system of keeping out of our land all for­  
eign powers, of never permitting those of Eu­  
rope to intermeddle with the affairs of our na­  
tions. It is to maintain our own principle, not  
to depart from it; and if, to facilitate this, we  
can affect a division of the body of the Euro­  
pean powers, and draw over to our side the  
most powerful member, surely we should do  
it. But I am clearly of Mr. Chan­  
ning&#x27;s opinion, that it will prevent instead of  
provoking war.  
With Great Britain withdrawn from their  
scale and shifted into that of our two contin­  
ents, all Europe combined would not under­  
take such a war. For how would they pro­  
pose to get at either enemy without superio

fleets? Nor is the occasion to be slighted which  
this proposition offers, of declaring our protest  
against the atrocious violations of the rights of  
nations, by the interference of any one in the  
internal affairs of another, so flagitiously be­  
gun by Bonaparte, and now continued by the  
qually lawless alliance calling itself holy.  
But we have first to ask ourselves a ques­  
tion: Do we wish to acquire to our own con­  
federacy any one or more of the Spanish pro­  
inces? I candidly confess that I have ever  
looked on Cuba as the most interesting addi­  
tion which could ever be made to our system  
of States. The control which, with Florida  
point, this island would give us over the Gulf  
of Mexico, and the countries and isthmus bor-  
dering on it, as well as all those whose water  
flow into it, would fill up the measure of our po­  
litical well-being. Yet as I am sensible that  
this can never be obtained, even with her own  
 consent, but by war; and its independence,  
which is our second interest (and especially it  
independence of England can be secured  
 without it, I have no hesitation in abandoning  
 my first wish to future chances, and accepting  
its independence, with peace and the friend­  
I ship of England, rather than its association at  
 at the expense of war and her enmity.  
I could honestly, therefore, join in the dee­  
aration proposed, that we aim not at the ac­  
quisition of any of those possessions, that we  
will not stand in the way of any amicable ar-  
rangement between them and the mother coun-  
try; but that we will oppose, with all our  
means, the forcible interposition of any other  
power, as auxiliary, stipendiary, or under any  
ther form or pretext, and most especially  
their transfer to any power by conquest, o­  
sion, or acquisition in any other way, I should  
think it, therefore, advisable that the Execu­  
tive should encourage the British Government  
 to a continuance in the dispositions expressed  
in these letters, by an assurance of his concur­  
rence with them as far as his authority goes;  
and that, as it may lead to war, the declaration  
I which requires an act of Congress, the ease  
hall be laid before them for consideration, at  
 their first meeting, and under the reasonable­  
 aspect in which it is seen oy himself.  
&quot;I have been so long weaned from political  
subjects, and have so long ceased to take any  
interest in them, that I am sensible I am not  
qualified to offer opinions on them worthy of  
any attention. But the question now proposed  
involves consequences so lasting, and effects so  
lecisive of our future destinies, as to rekindl  
all the interest I have heretofore felt on such  
casions, and to induce me to the hazard of  
opinions which will prove only my wish to  
ntribute still my mite toward any thing  
which may be useful to our country. And  
praying you to accept it at only what it I  
Worth, I add the assurance of my constant and  
Affectionate friendship and respect.

JIonticello, October 24, 1S23.  
Dear Sir, The question presented by the  
letters you have sent me, is the most momen­  
tous which has ever been offered to my con  
  
templation since that ot independence. That  
made us a nation; this sets out our compass  
and points the course which we arc to steer  
through the ocean of time opening on us.  
And never could we embark on it under  
circumstances more auspicious. Our first  
and fundamental maxim should be never to  
  
entangle ourselves in the broils of Europe.  
Our second, never to snfler Europe to inter­  
meddle with cis-Atlantic affairs. America,  
Xorth and South, has a set of interests dis­  
tinct from those of Europe, and peculiarly  
her own. She should therefore have a sys­  
tem of her own, separate and apart from that  
of Europe. &quot;While the last is laboring to  
become the domicil of despotism, our en­  
deavor should surely be, to make our hem­  
isphere that of freedom. One nation, most  
of all, could disturb us in this pursuit; she  
now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in  
it. 35y acceding to her proposition, we de­  
tach her from the bands, bring her mighty  
weight into the scale of free government,  
and emancipate a continent at one stroke,  
which might otherwise linger long in doubt  
and difficulty. Great Britain is the nation  
  
which can do us the most harm of any one,  
orall on carth;and with heron ourside we need  
not fear tho whole world. With her then, we  
should most sedulously cherish a cordial  
friendship ; and nothing would tend more to  
knit our affections than to be fighting once  
more, side by side, in the same cause. 2s&quot;ot  
that I would purchase even her amity at the  
price of taking part in her wars. But the  
war in which the present position might en­  
gage us, should that be its consequence, is  
not her war, but ours. Its object is to intro­  
duce and establish the American system, of  
keeping out of our land all foreign powers,  
of never permitting those of Europe to inter­  
meddle with the affairs of our nations. It is  
to maintain our own principle, not to depart  
from it. And if, to facilitate this, we can ef­  
fect a division in the body of the European  
powers, and draw over to our side its most  
powerful member, surely we should do it.  
Jlut I am clearly of Mr. Canning&#x27;s opinion,  
that it will prevent, instead of provoking  
war. With Great Britain withdrawn from  
their scale, and shifted into that of our two  
continents, all Europe combined would not

over the Gulf of Mexico, and the countries  
and isthmui bordering on it, as well as all  
those whose waters How into it, would fill  
  
up the measure of our political well-being,  
let, as I am sensible that this can never be  
obtained, even with her own consent, but by  
war; arid it independence, which is our  
second interest (especially its independence  
of England), can be secured without it, 1

wish to future chances, and accepting&#x27;its in­  
dependence, with peace and the friendship  
of England, rather than its association, at  
the expense of war and her enmity.  
I could honestly, therefore, join in the

any other power by conquest, cession, or

tion of which requires an act of Congress, the  
case shall be laid before them for considera­  
tion at their first meeting, and under the  
reasonable aspect in which it is seen by  
himself.  
I havc been so Jong weaned from political  
subjects, and have so long ceased to take any  
interest in them, that I am sensible I am  
not qualified to offer opinions on them  
worthy of any attention. But the question  
now proposed involves consequences so last­  
ing, and effects so decisive of our future des­  
tinies, nsj to re-kindle all the interest ,1 have  
heretofore-felt on snch occasions, and in­  
duce jno to the hazard of opinions, which&#x27;  
will prove only my wish to contribute still  
my mite towards anything which may be  
useful to our country. And praying you to

&quot;The question presented by the letter rou have  
aent me ia the mmt momeutuua ever of­  
fered to my contemplation aioce that of indepen­  
dence. That made as a nation ; thin sets ear  
compass and puidta our cour.-e which we are to  
steer tbrough the ocean of time opening on ua  
and never could we embark on it under cirr.um­  
atancea more auspicious. Our first and fundamen­  
tal maxim should be&#x27;, never to entangle ouraelve  
in the broiU ot Europe. Our second, never to  
antler Europe to intermeddle with cie-Atlantis af­  
fair. America, north and south, ha a set ot in­  
terests distinct from thi.se oi Europe, and pecu­  
liarly her own. She hould, therefore, have a svs­  
teai uf her own, separate and apart from that &quot;of  
Europe. VVuile the last ia laboring- to become the  
domicile of despotism, our eoeaur should surely  
be to make our hemisphere that of freedom. One  
nation, most of all, could duturb as in thi pur­  
suit; she now oilers to lead, a d and accompany  
us in it. By acceding to her proposition, we de­  
tach her from the hand of despots, buog ner  
m ghty weight into the scale of free government,  
a Ml emancipate a continent at one atroke, which  
might otherwise linger long in doubt and difficul­  
ty. Great Briuan is the nation which can do ua  
the moat harm of any one, or all on earth; and  
with her on our side, we need not fear the whole  
  
Wednesday Eveulne;.  
  
world. With her, then, we ahonld moat sedulous  
  
ly cherish a cordial Iriendship ; and nothing would  
tend mora to knit oui affections than to be fight­  
ing oace more, side by side, in the same cause.  
Not that I would purchaae even her amity at the  
price of taking part ia her wars. Bat the war ia  
which the present proposition might engage us,  
should that be its consequence, i not her war,but  
ours. Its object is to introduce and establish the  
American system of keeping out of our land alt  
foreign powers, of aever permitting those of Eu  
rope to intermeddle with the affair ot our nation.  
It ia to maintain our own principle, not to depart  
from it; and if, to facilitate ibis, we can effect a  
division in the body of the European powera, and  
draw over to our aide ita mosi&#x27;powerlul member,  
surely we should do it. But I am clearly of Mr.  
Canning&#x27;a opinion, that it will prevent instead ot  
provoke a war. With Great Britian withdrawn  
from their scale and shifted into that of our two  
continents, all Europe combined would not un­  
dertake auch a war. For how would they piopoae  
to get at either enemy without auperior fleets f  
Nor is the occaaion to be alighted which thia prop­  
osition offers, of declaring our protests against the  
atrocioua violations ot the rights ot nations, by the  
interference ot any one ia the international affairs  
of another, ao flagitiously begun by Bonaparte,  
and now continued by the equally lawleaa alliance  
calling itself holy.  
But we have first to ask ourselves a question :  
Do we wish to acquire to our own confederacy any  
one or more ol the Spanish provinces t I candid  
ly conless that t have ever looked on Cuba aa the  
roost interesting addition that could ever be made  
to our aystem of alates. The control which, with  
Honda point, this island would Rive us over the  
Gulf of Mexico, and the countries and iathmua  
bordering on t, as well as all those whose watera  
flow into it, would nil up the measure ot our po  
litical well-being. Vet, as 1 am sensible that lots  
can never be obtained, even with her own consent,  
but by war; and if ita independence, which ia our  
second interest (and especially its independence  
ot EneUnd). can be aecured without it, I have no  
hesitation in abandoning mv first wish to future  
chances, and accepting its independence, with  
peace and the friendship ot Kngl&amp;nd, rather than  
its associations at the expense ol war ana ner en  
mitv.  
&#x27;I could honestly, therefore, join in the decla­  
ration proposed, that we aim not at the acquisi­  
tion of any of those possessions, that we will not  
stand in the wav of any amicable arrangement oe  
tween them and the mother country , but that we  
will oppose, with all our means, the forcible inter  
position of any other power, as auxiliary, atipen-  
mrv nr under an other lonn or pretext, anu  
most especially their transfer to any power by con  
quest, cession or acquisition in any other way.  
1 ahould think it, tberelore, advisable that ths ex  
ecutive should encourage the British government  
to rnnimuioca in the dispositions expressed in  
these letters, by an assurance of bia concurrence  
with them as far a his authority goea ; and that,

Quires an act of congress, the case shall be laid  
be lore them tor considertion,at their first meeting,  
and under the reasonable aspect in which it is  
seen by himseif.  
&quot;I have been so long weaned from political sub­  
jects, and have so lone ceased to take any inter  
est in them, that I am sensible I am not qualified  
to otler opiniona on them worthy ol any attention  
But the question now proposad involves conse­  
quences so lasting, and effects ao deciaive of our

MoNTIcELlO, October 2, 182.  
  
To the PresIdent:  
  
Dear Sir- The question presented by the  
letters you have sent me is the most mo­  
mentous which has ever been offered to my  
contemplation since that of independence.  
That made us a nation, this sets the com­  
pass and points the course which we are to  
steer through the ocean of time opening  
upon us. And never could we embark upon  
it under circumstances more auspicious.  
Our first and fundamental maxim should  
be, never to entangle ourselves in the broils  
of Europe. Our second, never to suffer  
Europe to intermeddle with Cis-tlantic af­  
fairs. America, North and South, has a set  
of interests distinct from those of Euro  
and peculiarly her own. She should there­  
fore have a system of her own, separate and  
apart from that of Europe.  
While the last is laboring to become the  
domicile of despotism, our endeavor should  
surely be to make our hemisphere that of  
freedom. One nation, most of all, could  
disturb us in this pursuit; she now offers  
to lead, ald, and accompany us in it. By  
acceding to her proposition, we detach her  
from the band of despots, bring her mighty  
weight into the scale of free government,  
and emancipate a continent at one stroke,  
which might otherwise linger long in  
doubt and difficulty. Great Britain is the  
nation which can do us the most harm of  
any one or all on earth; and with her on  
our side, we need not fear the whole world.  
With her, then, we should most sedulously  
cherish a cordial friendship; and nothing  
would tend more to knit our affections than  
to be fighting once more, side by side, in  
the same cause. Not that I would pur­  
chase even her amity at the price of taking  
part in her wars.  
But the war in which the present propost­  
tion might engage us, should that be its con­  
sequence, is not her war, but ours. Its object  
is to introduce and establish the American  
system, of keeping out of our land all foreign  
powers, of never permitting those of Europe  
to intermeddle with the affairs of our ndtion.  
It is to maintain our own principle, not to  
depart from it. And if, to facilitate this,  
we can effect a division in the body of the  
European powers, and draw over to our  
side its most powerful member, surely we  
should do it. But I am clearly of Mr. Can­  
ning&#x27;s opinion that it will prevent, instead  
of provoking war. With Great Britain  
withdrawn from their scale, and shifted  
into that of our two continents all Europe  
combined would not undertake such a war.  
For how would they propose to get a

either enemy without superfor fleets? Nor  
is the occasion to be slighted which this  
proposition offers of declaring our protest  
aqinst the atrocious vlolations of the rights  
nations, by the interference of any one in  
the internal affairs of another, so flagitiously  
began by Bonaparte, and now continued by  
the equally lawless Alliance calling itself  
Holy. Goil wowine umins  
But we have first to ask ourselves a ques­  
tion. Do we wish to acquire to our own  
confederacy any one or more of the Span­  
ish provinces? I candidly confess that I  
have ever looked on Cuba as the most in­  
terestingraddition which could ever be  
made to our system of States. The con­  
trol which, with Florida point, this island  
would give us over the Gulf of Mexico,  
and the countries and isthmus bordering  
on it, as well as all those whose waters  
flow into it, would fill up the measure of  
our political well-being.&quot;Yet, as I am sen­  
sible that this can never be obtained, even  
with her own consent, but by war, and its  
independence, which is our second interest  
(and especially its independence of Eng­  
land), can be secured without it, I have no  
hesitation in abandoning my first wish to  
future chances, and accepting its inde  
pendence, with peace and the friendship of  
England rather than its association at the  
expense of the war and her enmity  
I could honestly, therefore, join in the  
declaration proposed, that we aim not at  
the acquisition of any of those possessions,  
that we will not stand in the way of any  
amicable arrangement between them and  
the mother country; but that we will op-  
pose, with aldour means, the forcible in  
terposition of any other power as auxilary,  
stipendary, or under any other form or  
pretext, and most especially their transfer  
to any power by conquest, cession, or acqui  
sition in any other way. I should think it,  
therefore, advisable that the Executive  
should encourage the British Government  
to a continuance in the dispositions ex  
pressed in these letters, by an assurance of  
his concurrence with them so far as his an  
thority goes; and that, as it may lead to  
war, the declaration of which requires an  
act of Congress, the case shall be laid before  
them for consideration, at their first meets  
ing, and under the reasonable aspect in  
which it is seen by himself.  
I have been so long weaned from politi­  
cal subjects, and have so long ceased to  
take any interest in them, that I am sensi­  
ble I am not qualifled to offer opinions on  
them worthy of any attention. But the  
question nom proposed involves consequences  
so lasting, and effects so decisive of our future  
destinies, as to rekindle all the interest I have  
heretofore felt on such occasions, and to ins  
duce ine to the hazard of opinions which  
will prove only my wish to contribute still  
my mite toward any thing that may be use­  
ful to our country. And in the hope that  
you accept it for what it is worth, I give  
you the assurance of my constant and af-  
fectionate

DzAR SIR: The question presented by the letters  
ou have sent meis the most momentous which has ever  
n offered tomy contenppinsion sincethat of Independ-  
ence. That made us a Nation; this sets our compass  
and points the course which we are to steer through  
the ocean of time opening on us. And never could  
we embark on itt under circumstances more aus-  
icious. Our first and fundamental maxim should  
be never to entangle ourselves in the_ broils  
ot pe. Our second, never to suffer Europe  
to intermeddle with cisatiantic aire. Amer-  
ica, North and South, has a set of interests dis-  
tinct from those of Europe, and peculiarly her own.  
She should therefore have a system of her own, sepa-  
rate and apart from that of Europe. While the last is  
laboring to become the domicil of despotism, our en-  
deavor should surely be, to make our hemisphere that  
of freedom. One nation, most of all, could disturb us  
in this pursuit; she now offers to lead, aid, and ac-  
company us in it. By acceding to her pecepeven we  
detach her from the bands, bring ber mighty weight  
into the scale of free government, and emancipate a con-  
tinent at one stroke, which might here ola lone  
doubt and difficulty. Great Britain is the nation which  
ean do us the most harm of any one or a)! on earth, and  
with her on our side we need not fear the whole world.  
With her, then, we should most sedulously cherish a  
cordial friendship, and nothing would tend more to knit  
our affections than tobe fighting once more, side by  
side,inthe same cause. Not that I would purchase  
even her amity at So Bice of taking part in her wars.  
But the warin which the present proposition might  
engage us, should that be its consequence, is not her  
war, but ours. Its ob, isto introduce and establish  
the American system of keeping out of our land all  
foreign powers; of never permitting those of Europe  
to intermeddle with the irs of our nations. Itisto  
maintain our own principle, not to depart from it. And  
if, to {ncliltate this. we can effect a division in the body  
of the Euro powers, und draw over to our side its  
Tr, surely we should doit. But  
  
re elear of ir Cauning’s opinion, gat it will  
prevent inslead of provoking war. &quot;With Gveat Brita  
  
n nad sh at  
of our two continents, all Europe combined would not  
undertake such a war. w  
  
would they propose to  
  
\
  
Euro  
  
get at either  
Qouasion to bes  
  
ec! oO  
of hts of  
  
without superior fleets? Nor is the  
ted which this proposition offers, of  
the atrocious violations  
  
ms; by the interference of any  
one 8 of another, so flagitiously be-  
  
nay and now continued by th uall  
fawiess iance itself holy. haat a  
  
But we have first to ask ourselves a question. Do wa  
wish to acquire to our own confederacy any one or more  
of the Spani ces? I candidly confess that I have  
ever looked on Cuba‘as the most interesting addition  
which could ever made to our system of States.  
The control which, with Florida Point, this island  
would give us over the Gulf of Mexico, und  
the countries and istlimus sneering on it, as  
well as those whose waters flow into it, would fill  
up the measure of our political well-being. Yet,  
as lam sensible that this can never be obtained, even  
with her own consent, but by war, and its independence,  
which is our second interest, (and especially its inde-  
pendence of England,) can secured without it, I  
have no_ hesitation in abandoning my first wish to  
future chances, and accepting its independence, with  
peace and the friendship of Bngland, rather than its  
assoctati:-n, at the expense of war and her enmity.  
  
I could honestly. layimy join in the declaration  
proposed, that we aim not at the acquisition of any of  
those possessions; that we will not stand in the way of  
any amicable arrangement between them and the  
mother country; but that we will oppose with ail our  
means the forcible interposition of any other power,  
as auxiliary, stipendiary, or under any other form  
or pretext, and most especially. their transfer  
to any power by conquest, cession, or sacquisi-  
tion in any other way. I should think it, therefore, ad-  
visable that the Executive should encourage the  
British Government to a continuance in the Eopcat-  
tions expressed in these letters by an assurance of his  
concurrence with them as far us his authority goes,  
and tha. as it may lead to wur, the declaration of which  
requires an act of Congress, the case sball be laid be-  
fore them for consideration at their first meeting, and  
ung the reasonable aspect in which it is seen by him-  
set.  
  
I have been so long weaned from political subjects,  
and haye so long ceased to take any interest in them,  
that] am sensible! am not qualified to offer opinions  
on them wary of any attention. But the question  
now proposed involves consequences so lasting and

which will prove only my wish to contribute still my

the importance of the subject, sent the pa­

 eaet ee   
as follows  
The question is the most momentous ever of  
fered to my contemplation since that of indepen­  
e dence. That made us a nation; this sets our compass  
and points the course which we should steer through  
the ocean of time opening on us. And never could we  
embark upon it under circumstances more auspicious  
Our first and fundamental maxim should be never to  
entangle ourselves in the broits of Europe; our second  
never to suffer Europe to intermeddle with cis-Atlantic  
affairs. America, North and South, has a set of inter  
FFC2 ests distinct from those of Europe and peculiarly her­  
$25 own. She should therefore have a aystem of her awn

*“* MONTICELLO, Oct. 24, 1823.  
  
“Dear Sir: The question presented by  
the letters you have sent me is the most  
momentous which has even been offered to  
my contemplation since that of Independ-  
ence. That made us a Nation; this sets our  
compass and points the course which we  
are to steer through the ocean of time  
opening on us. And never could we em-  
bark upon it under circumstances more  
auspicious. Our first and fundamental max-  
im should be never to entangle ourselves in  
the broils of Europe; our second, never to  
suffer Europe to intermeddle with cisatlan-  
tic affairs. America, North and South, has  
@ set of interests distinct from those of  
Europe and peculiarly our own. She,should,  
therefore, have a system of her own, sepa-  
Tate and apart from that of Europe. While  
the last is laboring to become the domi-  
Cile of despotism, our endeavor should surely  
be to make our hemisphere that of free-  
dom.  
  
“One nation, most of all, could disturb  
us in this pursuit; she now offers to lead,  
aid and accompany us in it. By acceding  
to her proposition we detach her from the  
bands, bring her mighty weight into the  
scale of free government, and emancipate  
a continent at one stroke, which might  
otherwise linger long in doubt and difficulty.  
Great Britain is the nation which can do  
us the most harm of any one or all on  
earth, and with her on our side we need  
not fear the whole world. With her, then,  
we should moct sedulously cherish a cor-  
dial friendship, and nothing would tend  
more to knit our affections than to be  
fighting once more side by side in the same  
cause. Not that I would purchase even  
her amity at the price of taking part in her  
wars.  
  
*“ But the war in which the present propo-  
sition might engage us, should that be its  
consequence, is not her war but ours. Its  
object is to introduce and establish the  
American system of keeping out of our  
land all foreign powers—ot never permitting  
those of Europe to intermeddle with the  
affairs of our nations, It is to maintain  
our own principle, not to depart from it;  
and if, to facilitate this, we can effect a  
division in the body of European powers  
and draw over to our side its most power-  
ful member, surely we should do it. But  
I am clearly of Mr. Canning’s opinion that  
it will prevent, instead of provoking war.  
With Great Britain withdrawn from their  
scaie and shifted into that of our two  
continents, all Eurone combined would not  
undertake such a war, for how would they  
propose to ge. at either enemy without  
superior fieets? Nor is the occasion to be  
slighted which this proposition offers of  
declaring our protest against the atrocious  
violations of the rights of nations by the  
interference of any one in the internal  
affairs of another so flagitiously begun by  
Bonaparte, and how continued by the equal-  
ly lawless alliance calling itself Hoiy.  
  
“But we have first to ask ourselves a  
question. Do we wish to acquire to our  
own confederacy any one or more of the  
Spanish provirces? I candidiy confess that  
I have ever looked on Cuba as the most  
interesting addition which could ever be  
made to our system of States. The con-  
trol which, with Florida Point, this island  
would give us over the Gulf of Mexico and  
the countries and isthmus bordering on it, as  
well as all those whose waters flow into it,  
would fill up the measure of our political  
well-being. Yet, as I am sensible that this  
can never be obtained, even with her own  
consent, but by war, and its independence,  
which is our second interest, (and espe-  
cially its independence of England,) can  
be secured without it, I have no hesitation  
in abandoning my first wish to future  
chances, and accepting its independence,  
with peace and the friendship of England,  
rather than its association at the expense  
of war and her enmity.  
  
“JT could honestly, therefore, join in the  
declaration proposed that we aim, not at  
the acquisition of any of those possessions—  
that we will not stand in the way of any  
amicable arrangement between them and  
the mother country—but that we will op-  
pose with all our means the forcible in-  
terposition of any other power as aux-  
jliary, stipendiary, or under any other form  
or pretext, and most especially their trans-  
fer to any power by conquest, cession, of  
acquisition in any other way. I should  
think it therefore advisable that the Ex-  
ecutive should encourage the British Gov-  
ernment to a continuance in the disposi-  
tions expressed in these letters by an as-  
surance of nis concurrence with them as  
far as his authority goes, and that, as it  
may lead to war, the declaration of which  
requires an act of Congress, the case shall  
be laid before them for consideration at  
their first meeting, and under the reason®  
ble aspect in which it is seen by himself.  
  
“T have been so long weaned from politi-  
cal subjects, and have so long ceased to  
  
_ take any interest in them, that I am sensi-  
ble I am not qualified to offer opinions on  
them worthy of any attention; but the ques-  
  
tion now proposed involves consequences so  
lasting and effects so decisive of our future  
  
destinies as to rekindle all the interest I  
  
have heretofore felt on such occasions, and  
to induce me to the hazard of opinions  
which will prove only my wish to contribute  
still my mite toward anything which may  
be useful to our country. And, praying you  
to accept it at only what it is worth, I add  
  
  
  
the assurance of my constant and affection-  
ate friendship and respect.”’ :

“The question presented by the letters  
you have sent me is the most momentous  
which has ever been offered to my con-  
templation since that of Independence.  
That made us a nation; this sets our  
compass and points the course which  
we are to steer through the ocean of  
time opening on us. And never could we  
embark upon it under circumstances  
more auspicious. Our first and funda-

our second, never to suffer Europe to

America, North and South, has a set of  
interests distinct from those of Europe,  
and peculiarly her own. She should,  
therefore, have a system of her own,

The question presented by the letters ycu have  
sent me fs the most momentous which has ever  
been offered to my contemplation since that of  
Independence. That made us a_i nation,  
this sets our compass and points the course  
which we are to steer through the ceean of  
time opening on us. And never could we embark  
on it under circumstances mere auspicious. Our  
first and fundamental maxim should be, never  
to entangle ourselves in the broils of Europe.  
Our second, never to suffer Burope to intermeddle  
with cis-Atlantic affairs. America, North and  
South, has a set of interests distinct from  
those of Europe, and peculiarly her own. She  
should, therefore, have a system of her own,  
separate and apart from .that of Europe. While  
the last is laboring to become the domicile of  
despotism, our endeavor should surely be to  
make our hemisphere that of freedom.  
  
One nation, (England), most of all, could dis-  
turb us in this dispute; she now offers to lead,  
aid, and accompany us in it. By acceding to her  
proposition, we detach her from the bands, bring  
her mighty weight into the scale of free gov-  
ernment, and emancipate a continent at one  
stroke, which might otherwise linger long in  
doubt and difficulty. Great Britain is the nation  
which can do us the most harm of any one,  
or all on earth; and with her on our side we need  
not fear the whole world. With her, then, we  
should most sedulously cherish a cordial friendship,  
and nothing would tend more to knit our affec-  
tions than to be fighting once more, side ty side,  
in the same cause.  
  
Not that I would purchase even her amity  
at the price of taking part in her wars. But  
the war in which the present proposition might  
engage us, should that be its consequence, ig  
not her war, but ours. Its object is to intro-  
duce and establish the American system, of  
keeping out of our land all foreign powers, of  
never permitting those of Europe to intermed-,  
die with the affairs of our nations. It is to  
maintain our own principle, not to depart frem it.  
And if, to facilitate this, we can effect a  
division in the body of the European powers,  
and draw over to our side its most powerfal  
member, surely we should do it. But,I am  
clearly of Mr. Canning’s opinion, that it will  
prevent instead of provoking war. With Great  
Britain withdrawn from their scale and shifted

‘*Our first and fundamental maxim should be never to entangle

snit. She now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us init. By  
acceding to her proposition we detach her from the band of des-  
pots, bring her mighty weight into the scale of free government,  
and emancipate a continent at one stroke. Great Britain is the  
nation which can do us the most harm of any one or all on earth,  
and with her on our side we need not fear the whole world. With  
her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial friendship ;  
and nothing would tend more to knit our affections than to be  
fighting once more side by side in the same cause. Not that I  
would purchase even her amity at the price of taking part in her  
wars. But the war in which the present proposition might engage  
us, should that be its consequence, is not her war but ours. Its  
object is to introduce and establish the American system of keep-  
ing out of our land all foreign powers; of never permitting those  
of Europe to intermeddle with the affairs of our nation. But I  
am clearly of Mr. Canning&#x27;s opinion that this will prevent war in-  
stead of provoking it. Nor is the occasion to be slighted which  
this proposition offers of declaring our protest against the atro-  
cious violations of the rights of nations by the interference of any-  
one in the internal affairs of another, so flagitiously begun by  
Bonaparte, and now continued by the equally lawless Alliance  
calling itself Holy.  
  
‘* But we have first to ask ourselves a question, Do we wish to  
acquire to our own Confederacy any one or more of the Spanish  
provinces? I candidly confess that I have ever looked on Cuba  
as the most interesting addition which could ever be made to our  
system of States. The control which, with Florida Point, this is-  
land would give us over the Gulf of Mexico and the countries bor.  
dering on it as well as all those whose waters flow into it would  
fill up the measure of our political well-being. Yet as I am sensi-  
ble that this can never be obtained, even with her own consent,  
without war; and its independence, which is our second interest,  
can be secured without it, I have no hesitation in abandoning my  
first wish to future chances, and accepting its independence with  
peace and the friendship of England, rather than its association  
at the expense of war and her enmity.  
  
‘I could honestly, therefore, join in the declaration proposed,  
that we aim not at the acquisition of any of those possessions ;  
that we will not stand in the way of any amicable arrangement  
between them and the mother country. But that we will oppose  
with all our means the forcible interposition of any other powers,  
as auxiliary, stipendiary, or under any other form or pretext, and  
most especially their transfer to any power by conquest, cession,  
or acquisition in any other way, I should think it therefore ad-  
visable that the executive should encourage the British govern-  
ment to a continuance in the dispositions expressed in these let-  
ters by an assurance of his concurrence with them as far as his  
authority goes. JaFFrERSON.&quot;

earl  
.^part of the  
Monticollo, Oct. 34. 1823.—To the  
President—Dear Sir: The question  
presented by tho letters you have sent  
me, is the most momentous which has  
ever been offered to my contemplation  
since that of Independence. That made  
nation, this sets our compass and  
aro to steer  
lutter&#x27;s second tenu  
of  
points a course which  
through tho ocean of time, opening  
And novor could  
.  
embark  
under circumutancns more auspicious.  
Our first and fundamental maxim  
should bo, never to ontanglo ourselves  
in tho broils of Europe. Our second,  
never to suffer Europe to iutermeddle  
with eis-Atlantic affairs. America, »  
North and South, has a set of interests  
distinct from those of Europe, and  
peculiarly her  
fore have a system of her own, separate  
and apart from that of Europe. While  
the last is laboring to become the  
domicile of despotism, our endeavor  
should surely bo to make our hemis­  
phere that of freedom. One nation,  
most of all, could disturb us in this  
pursuit ; she now offers to lead, aid,  
and accompany us in It. By acceding  
to her proposition, we detach her from  
the bands, bring her mighty weight  
into the scale of free government, anil  
emancipate the continent at one stroke,  
which might otherwise linger long in  
doubt and difficulty,  
tho nation which ca  
harm of any  
with her  
tho whole world. r ~  
should most sedulously  
cordial friendship; and nothing would  
tend more to knit  
to be fighting  
in the same «  
purchase even her amity at tho price  
of taking part in her wars. But tho  
war in which the present proposition  
might engage  
consequents©, is not her war but ours.  
Its object is to introduce and establish  
tho American system, of keeping out  
land all foreign powers, of never  
permitting those of Europe to inter­  
meddle with the affairs of  
tions. It is to maintain our  
eiplo «not to depart fr  
facilitate this,  
in the body of the European powers  
and draw over to our side its most  
powerful member, surely we should do  
it. But I am clearly of Mr. Canning&#x27;s  
opinion, that it will prevent instead of  
provoking war. With Great Britain  
withdrawn fr«  
into that of  
it  
She should thorn­  
Great Britain is  
do us the most  
earth ; and  
need not fear  
With her then,  
cherish a  
all  
side  
affections than  
•e more, side by side,  
». Not that I would  
. should that be its  
prin­  
it. And if, to  
effect a division  
their hcuIo and shifted  
two continents, all  
Europe combined would not undertake  
such a war. For how would they pro­  
pos» to get at either enemy without  
superior fleets? N«  
be slighted which this proposition  
offers, of declaring  
the at loci  
of nations, by tho interference of any  
in tho internal affairs of another,  
flagitiously begun by Bonaparte,  
continued by the equally law­  
less alliance, calling jtself holy.  
But we have first to ask ourselves a  
question. Do wo wish to acquire to  
tho occasion to  
protest against  
violations of tho rights  
more  
of the Spanish provinces? I candidly  
looked  
confess, that I have  
Cuba as tin* in««si interesting addition  
which could ever bn mudo to  
tern of States. The control which,  
from Florida I &#x27;«mit, this island would  
give us over the Gulf of Mexico, and  
the countries and isthmus bordering  
all those whoso waters  
into it. would fill up the measure  
political well-being. Yet,  
sensible that thin can never be  
obtained, even with her  
but by  
which i  
especially its independence of Eng­  
land, ) can be secured without it. t  
have no hesitation, in abandoning my  
first wish to future chances,and accept­  
ing its independence, with peace and  
the friendship of England, rather than  
its association, at the expense of war  
and her enmity.  
I could honestly, therefore, join in  
the declaration proposed, that w  
not at the aciiuisition of any of these  
possessions, that wo will not stand in  
the way of any amicable arrangement  
between them and the mother country;  
but that we will oppose, with all  
•ans, the forcible interposition of any  
other power, as auxiliary, stipendiary,  
or under any other form or pretext,  
and most especially, their transfer to  
any power by conquest, cession,  
acquisition in any other way. I should  
think it, therefore, advisable, that the  
•utive should encourage tho British  
government to the continuance in the  
dispoaiti  
fl  
(

I its independents,

expressed in these letters,

it may lead to war, tho  
declaration of which requires  
of Congress, the c  
fore them for consideration at their  
first meeting, and under the reasonable  
;bieh it is s«*on by himself.  
long weaned from  
political subjects, and bavo  
with them  
and that  
not  
shall bo laid bn­  
have been  
i  
long  
ceased to take any interest in them,  
that I am sensible I am n«»t qualifie«!  
to offer opinions on them worthy of any  
attention. But tho question now pro­  
posed involves consequences so lasting,  
and effects so decisive of our future  
destini(*s. as to rekindlo all tiie interest  
I have heretofore felt on such  
sinus, and to induce mo to the hazard  
, which will prove only my  
wish to contribute still my mite  
towards anything which may bo useful  
country. And praying you to  
accept it at only what it îh worth, I  
adil the assurance of my constant and  
affectionate frmndship and respect.

IMontieello, Oct. 2, US”.”,.  
Dear Sir: The question presented by  
the letters you have sent me is the  
most momentous which has been ever  
otTcred to my contemplation since that  
of imh&#x27;pendenee. That made us a na­  
tion. this sets our compass and points  
(lie course which we are to steer thro’  
the ocean of time opening on us. and  
never could we embark on it: under cir­  
cumstances more auspicious. Our first  
and fundamental maxim should lie  
never to entangle ourselves in the  
broils of Eurojie; our second, never to  
suffer Europe to intermeddle with Ois-  
Atlaivtic affairs. America. North and  
South, has a set of interests distinct  
from those of Europe, and pec ilia ric­  
her own. Sin* should thereto is4, have  
a system of her own, separate and apart  
from that of Europe. While the last  
is laboring to become the domicil of des­  
potism, omr endeavor should surely l»e to  
make our hemisphere that of freedom.  
One nation, most of all, could distur-.-  
us in this pursuit; she now ofltrs to  
lead, aid. and aeeompanv us in it—b&gt;  
acceding to her proposition, we detach  
her from the hand of despots, bring hci  
mighty weight into the scale of free  
g&lt; \* riin ens, and emancipate a continent  
at one stroke, which might otherwise  
linger long in doubt and difficulty. Great  
Britain is the nation which can do us  
th*4 most harm of any one, or all. on  
earth; and with her on our side we  
need not fear the whole world—wills  
her then we should the most sedulously  
cherish a cordial friendship, and nothing  
would tend more to knit our affections  
than to lie fighting once more, side by  
side, in the same cause. Not that i  
would purchase even her amity at tin­  
price of taking prut in her wars but  
the war in which the pres. :,t proposition  
might engage us, should that be its con­  
sequence, is not her war. but ours, its  
object is to introduce and establish the  
American system of keeping out of our  
land all foreign jtowers, of never per­  
mitting those of Enrol** to intermeddle  
with the affairs of our nations. It is  
to maintain our own principle, not tv  
depart from it, and if. to facilitate this,  
we can effect a division in the body of  
the European powers, and draw ove,  
to our side its most powerful memliet.  
surely wo should do it, but I am clear­  
ly of Mr. Fanning&#x27;s opinion that it will  
prevent, instead of provoking war.  
With Great Britain withdrawn from  
tier scale and shifted into that of our  
two continents, all Europe combined  
would not undertake such a war. fo*  
how&#x27; would they propose to get at eithe

MdNTICEL,Lf&gt;. October 24. 1823.  
Dear Sir: The question presented by  
the inters you have sent me Is the most  
momentous&quot; which has ever been offered  
to my contemplation since that of in­  
dependence made us a nation. This sets  
our compass and points the course  
which we are to steer through the  
ocean of time opening on us; and never  
could we embark on it under circum­  
stances more auspicious. Our first and  
fundamental maxim should be never to

rope- our second should be never to suf­  
fer Europe to interfere with Cis-Atlan­

has a set of interests distinct from those  
of Europe, and peculiarly her own.  
While the last is seeking to become the  
domicile of despotism, our endeavor  
ehould be to surely make our hemis­

of all could disturb ub in this pursuit.  
She now offers to lead and accompany

do us the most harm of any one, or  
all on earth; and, with her on our side,  
we need not fear the whole world. With  
her, then, we should most sedulously  
cherish a cordial friendship; ajid noth­  
ing could more securely knit our af­  
fections than to be fighting side by side,  
in the same cause. Not that I would  
purchase even her amity at the price of  
taking part in our wars. But the war  
in which the present proposition might  
engage us. should that be its conse­  
quence, is not her war, but ours. Its  
object is to introduce and establish the  
American system of keeping out of our  
land all foreign powers; of never per­  
mitting those of Europe to intermeddle  
with the affairs of our nations. It is  
to maintain our own principle; not to  
depart from it. And if, to facilitate this  
we can effect a division in the body of  
the European powers and draw over to  
our side its most powerful member,  
surely we should do it.  
But I am clearly of Mr. Canning&#x27;s  
opinion that it will prevent. Instead of  
provoking war with Great Britain.  
Withdrawn from their scale and shifted  
into that of our two continents, all Eu­  
rope combined could not undertake such  
a war. For how would they propose to  
get at either enemy without superior  
Meets? Nor is the occasion to be slight­  
ed which this proposition offers to pro­  
test against the interference of any one  
in the internal affairs of another, so  
flagitiously begun by Bonaparte, and  
now continued by the equally lawless  
alliance calling itself &quot;holy.&quot;  
But we have first to ask ourselves a  
question. Do we wish to acquire to our  
own confederacy any one or more of the  
Spanish provinces? I cordially confess  
that I have ever looked upon Cuba as  
the most interesting addition that could  
ever be made to our system of States.  
The control which, with Florida point,  
this island would give us over the Gulf  
of Mexico and the countries and the  
isthmus bordering on it, &amp;s well as  
those whose waters would flow into it,  
would fill up the measure of our po­  
litical well being. Yet, as I am sensible  
that this can never be obtained, even

with her own consent, but by war, and  
its own independence, which is our sec­  
ond interest (and especially its inde­  
pendence of England), I have no hesita­  
tion in abandoning my first wish to fu­  
ture chances and accepting its independ­  
ence with peace, and the friendship of  
England, rather than its association at  
the expense of war and her enmity.  
I could honestly, therefore, join in the  
declaration proposed, that we aim not  
at the acquisition of any of these pos­  
sessions; that we will not stand in the  
way of any amicable arrangement be­  
tween them and the mother country,  
but that we will oppose, with all our  
means, the forcible interposition of any  
other power, as auxiliary, stipendiary  
or in any other form or pretext, and  
most especially their transfer to any  
power by conquest, cession or acquisi­  
tion in any other way.  
I should think it therefore advisable  
that the executive should encourage  
the British Government to a continu­  
ance in the dispositions expressed in  
these letters by an answer of his con­  
currence with them as far as his au­  
thority goes; and that, as it may lead  
to war, the declaration of which re­  
quires an act of Congress, the case shall  
be laid before them for consideration at  
their first meeting and under the rea­  
sonable aspect in which it is seen by  
himself.

&quot;The question presented by the letters you have  
sent me is the most momentous which has ever been  
offered to my contemplation since that of Independ­  
ence. That made us a nation, this sets our compass  
and points the course which we are to steer through  
the ocean of time opening on us. And never could  
we embark on it under circumstances more auspi-  
cious. Our first and fundamental maxim should be:  
Never to entangle ourselves in the brolls of Europe, our  
second: Never to suffer Europe to intermeddle with of  
Atlantio affairs. America, North and South, has a set  
of interests distinct from those of Europe, and peou­  
liarly her own. She should therefore have a system  
of her own, separate and apart from that of Europe.  
While the last is laboring to become the domicile of  
despotism, our endeavor should surely be to make  
our hemisphere that of Freedom.

&#x27;Llonticello, October 24, 1823: . &#x27;Dear  
Sir, — The question presented by the  
letters you have eent me is the most  
momentous which has ever been offered to  
my contemplation since that of  
independence made us a nation. This sjts  
our compass, and paints the course which  
we are to steer through the ocean cf  
time opening on us; and neve? could we  
embark on it under circumstances more  
auspicious. Our first and fundamental  
maxim should be never to entangle  
ourselves in the broils of Europe; our  
seccud should be never to suffer Europe  
to interfere with Cis-Atlantic affaire.  
America, North and South, has a set of  
interests distinct from those of Europe,  
aid peculiarly ner own. While the last  
is seeking to become the domicile of  
despotism, our endeavor should bs to  
surely make our hemisphere that of  
freedom.1 , Onenation, most cf all,  
could disturb us in this pur- . suit.  
She now offers to lead and accompany us  
in it. By acceding to her proposition we  
detach her from a band of despots, bring  
her mighty weight into the ecale for  
free government, and emancipate a  
continent at one stroke, which might  
otherwise linger long in doubt and  
difficulty. &#x27;Great Britain is the nation  
which can do us the most barm cf any  
one, or ell on earth; and, with j her on  
cur side, we need not fear the -whole  
world, j With her, then, we should most  
sedulously cherish ? a cordial  
friendship; andnotfiing could more  
securely ] knit cur affections than to  
be fighting side by side, j in the same  
cause. Not that I would purchase even !  
her amity at the price of taking part in  
our wars. J But the war in which the  
present proposition might i engage us,  
should that bs its consequence, is not  
her j war, but ours. Its object is to  
introduce and es- I tablish the American  
system of keeping out of our ] land all  
foreign powers; of never permitting  
these ] of Europe to intermeddle with  
the affairs of&#x27; our j nations. It is to  
maintain our own principle ; not j to  
depart from it. And if, to facilitate  
this we i can effect a division in the  
body of the European ! Powers and draw  
over to our side its most powerful j  
member, surely we ehould do it. j But I  
am clearly of Mr. Canning&#x27;s opinicu that  
it will prevent, instead of provoking  
war with Great Britain. Withdrawn from  
their scate and shifted onto that of our  
two continents, all Europe combined  
could not undertake euch a. war. For how  
would they propose to get ai either  
enemy without superior j fleets? Not is  
ihe occasion to be slighted which j this  
proposition offers to protest against  
the inter- ; ferenee of any one in the  
internal affairs of another, eo  
flagitiously tegun by Bonaparte, and now  
continued by the equally lawless  
alliance calling itself ?holy.&#x27; : But we  
have first to aek oureelves a question.  
Do we wish to acquire to our own  
confederacy any one cr more of th©  
Spanish provinces? I cordially confess  
that I have ever looked upon Cuba as the  
most interesting addition that could  
&#x27;ever be made to our &#x27;system of States.  
The control which, with Florida point,  
this island would give us over the Gulf  
of Mexico, and the countries and the  
isthmus bordering on it, as well as  
those wbess waters would flow into it.  
would fill up the measure of our  
political well-being. Yet, as I am  
eeasible that this can never be  
obtained, even with her own consent, but  
by war, and its own independence, which  
is our second interest (and especially  
its independence of England), I have no  
hesitation in abandoning my first wish  
to future chances, and accepting its  
independence with peace, and the  
friendship of England, rather than its  
association at the expense of war and  
her enmity. - &#x27;I could honestly,  
therefore, join in the dBclaraticn  
proposed, t&amp;at we aim not at the  
acquisition of any of these possessions;  
that we will not stand in the way of any  
amicable arrangement bstween them and  
the mother country, but that we will  
..oppose, with all our means, the  
forcible interposition of any other  
power, as auxiliary, ?stipendiary, or in  
any ether form or pretext, and most  
especially their transfer to any power  
by conquest, csssion, or*acquieiticn in  
any other way. &#x27;I should think it  
therefore advisable that the executive  
(should encourage the British Government  
to a continuance in the dispositions  
expressed in ibeas letters by an answer  
of his concurrence witli them as far as  
his authority goes; and that, as it may  
lead to war,, the declaration of which  
requires an act of Congress, the case  
shall be laid before them for.  
consideration &#x27; at their first .meeting  
and under the reasonable aspect in which  
it is seen by himself. &#x27;I have been so  
long weaned from political subjects and  
have so long ceased to take any interest  
in them that I am sensible that I am not  
qualified to offer opiniors on them  
worthy of any attention;, but the  
question now proposed Involves  
consequences eo lasting and&#x27; effects so  
decisive of our future deitinies as to  
rekindle all the interest I have  
hitherto felt on such occasions, iand to  
induce me to hazard opinions which will  
prove only my wish to contribute still  
my mite towards anything which may be  
useful to cur eourtry.. and praying you  
to accept it only at what it is Vorth. I  
add the observance of my constant and  
affectionate f riend^iip and respect. _

course which we are to steer thro’ the ocean of time opening on onr view,  
and never could we embark on it under circumstances more auspicious. Our  
fii-st and fundamental maxim should be, never to entangle ourselves in the broils  
of Europe ; our 2&#x27;&#x27;- never to suffer Europe to meddle in Cis-Atlautic atlairs.  
America, North &amp; South, has a set of interests distinct from those of Europe,  
&amp; peculiarly her own. she should therefore have a system of her own, separate  
&amp; apart from that of Europe. While the last is laborinjj to become the  
domicil of despotism, our endeavor should surely be to make our hemisphere  
that of freedom. One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit; she  
now offers to lead, aid and accompany us in it. by acceding to her proposition  
W&#x27;e detach her from the hand of despots, bring her mighty weight into the scale  
of free Government, and emancipate at one stroke a whole continent, which might  
otherwise linger long in doubt &amp; difficulty. Great Britain is the nation which  
can do us the most harm of anyone, or all on earth ; and with her on our side we  
need not fear the whole world, with her then we should the most sedulously  
nourish a cordial friendship ; and nothing would tend more to knit our affections  
than to be fighting once more side by side in the same cause, not that I would  
purchase even her amity at the price of taking part in her wars, but the war  
in which the present proposition might engage us, should that be its consequence,  
is not her war, but ours, its object is to introduce and to establish the American  
system, of ousting fro!u our land all foreign nations, of never permitting the  
powers of Europe to intermeddle with the affairs of our nations, it is to main¬  
tain our own principle, not to depart from it, and if, to facilitate this, we can  
effect a division in the bod}- of the European powers, and draw over to our side  
its most powerful member, surely w’e should do it. but I am clearly of M&quot;&#x27;-  
Canning’s opinion, that it will prevent war, instead of provoking it. with Great  
Britain withdrawn from their scale and shifted into that of our two continents, all  
Europe combined would not dare to risk war. nor is the occasion to be slighted,  
which this proposition offers, of declaring our Protest against the atrocious viola¬  
tions of the rights of nations by the interference of anyone in the internal affairs  
of another, so flagitiously begun by Bonaparte, and now&#x27; continued by the equally  
lawless alliance, calling itself Holy.  
  
“ But we have first to ask ourselves a question, do we wish to acquire to our  
Confederacy any one or more of the Spanish provinces 1 I candidly confess that  
I have ever looked on Cuba as the most interesting addition which could ever be

would give us over the Gulph of Mexico, and the countries &amp; the Isthmus border¬  
ing on it, as well as all those whose w’aters How into it, would fill up the measure  
of our political wellbeing, yet, as I am sensible that this can never be obtained,  
even with her own consent, but by war; and as her independance, which is our  
second interest, and especially her independance of England, can be secured  
without it, I have no hesitation at abandoning my first wish to future chances,  
and accepting its independance with peace &amp; the friendship of England, rather than  
its association, at the expense of a war, and her enmity. I could honestly there¬  
fore join in the declaration proposed that wo aim not at the acquisition of any of  
those possessions, that we wall not stand in the w’ay of any amicable arrangement  
between any of them and the mother country: but that we will oppose, with all  
our means, the forcible interposition of any other power, either as auxiliary,  
stipendiary, or umler any other form or pretext, and most especially their transfer  
to any power, by conquest, cession, or acquisition in anj&#x27; other way.  
  
“ I should think it therefore advisable that the Executive should encorage  
the British Government to a continuance in the dispositions expressed in these  
letters, by an assurance of his concurrence with them, as far as his authority goes,  
and that as it may lead to war, the Declaration of which is vested in congress, the

the reasonable aspect in which it is seen by himself.  
  
“ I have been so long weaned from political subjects, and have so long ceased to  
take any interest in them, that I am sensible that I am not qualified to offer  
opinions worthy of any attention, but the question now proposed involves conse¬  
quences so lasting, and effects so decisive of our future destinies, as to kindle all  
the interest I have heretofore felt on these occasions, and to induce me to the  
hazard of opinions, which will prove my wish only to contribute still my mite in  
what may be useful to our country, and praying you to accept them at only what  
they are worth, I add the assurance of my constant &amp; affectionate friendship  
and respect.

this England protested, and withdrew  
from the Alliance. Isolated, she decided  
to invite the United States to join he  
in formal protest against the proposed  
interference of the Holy Alliance in Span-  
ish America. Mr. Canning suggested this  
joint action to United States minister  
Rush, who submitted the correspondence  
to President Monroe, and the latter sent  
the papers to ex-Presidents Jefferson and  
Madison, asking their views. The reply  
of Jefferson, dated October 24, 1823,  
shows how logically he deduced the  
Monroe Doctrine from the principles of  
Washington’s Farewell Address: “The  
question presented by the letters you  
have sent me is the most momentous  
which has been offered to my contempla-  
tion since that of Independence. That  
made us a nation; this sets the compass  
and points the course which we are to  
steer through the ocean of time opening

maxim should be never to entangle our-  
selves in the broils of Europe; our sec-  
ond, never to suffer Europe to inter-  
meddle in cisatlantic affairs. America,  
North and South, has a set of interests  
distinct from those of Europe and pecu-  
liarly her own; she should have a system  
of her own, separate and apart from that  
of Europe. ... We will oppose with  
all our means the forcible interposition  
of any other power” (in American colo-  
nial questions) “as auxiliary, stipendia-  
ry, or under any other form or pretext ;  
and most especially their transfer to any  
other power by conquest, cession, or ac-  
quisition in any other way.” This is  
a concrete statement of the principles  
of the Monroe Doctrine, if we add the  
claim, already then announced, that as  
all American territory belonged to some  
Christian power, none of it was subject  
to European colonization.  
  
Thus we have the Monroe Doctrine  
for the protection of America, North  
and South, from the European political  
schemes of balance of power, primacy of  
the great Powers, and European concert.

Do we wish to acquire to our Confederacy any one or more of the Spanish

trol which, with Florida Point, this island would give us over the Gulf of Mexico,

flow into it, would fill up the measure of our political wellbeing. Yet, as I am sensible

her independence, which is our second interest, and especially her independence of  
England, can be secured without it, I have no hesitation in abandoning my first

Monroe, for it discusses most ably the  
question involved, which he thinks is  
“the most momentous which has ever  
been offered to my contemplation since  
that of independence that made us a  
nation.”  
There is much in this letter that  
bears upon some of the questions that  
confront the American people today,  
and may now be read in the light of  
the present as well as thaf 6f the past.  
He says: “Our first and fundamental  
maxing should be never to entangle  
ourselves in the broils of Europe; our  
second never to suffer Europe to med­  
dle in Cis-Atlantic affairs. America,  
North and South, has a set of interests  
distinct from those of Europe  
and peculiarly her own; she  
should therefore have a sys­  
tem of her own, separate and apart  
from that of Europe. * * * Great  
Britain is the nation which can do us  
the most harm of any one or all on  
earth;‘and with her on our side we  
need not fear the whole world. With  
her, then, we should most sedulously  
nourish a cordial friendship, and noth­  
ing would tend more to knit our af­  
, feetions than to be fighting once more  
side by side in the same cause. Not  
that I would purchase even her amity  
at the price of taking part in her wars,  
but the war in which the present  
proposition might engage us, should  
that be its consequence, is not her war  
but ours.”’  
Further along Jefferson asks the  
question: “Do we wish to acquire to  
our confederacy any one or more of the  
. Spanish provinces? I candidly confess  
• that I have ever looked on Cuba as the  
most interesting gfldltion which could  
. ever be made to &lt;nir system of states.

Jefferson’s comment upon the case as it  
stood is Interesting. He said: &quot;While  
Europe is laboring to become the domicile  
of despotism, our endeavor should surely  
be to_make our hemisphere that of free­

in it. By acceding to her proposition, we  
detach her from the powers, bring her

one of all on the earth, and with her on  
our side we need not fear the world. With  
her, then, we should most sedulously cher­

whom he could advise and John Quincy  
Adams as his Secretary of State. Mr.  
Jefferson said :—  
  
Our first and fundamental maxim should  
be never to entangle ourselves in the broiis  
of Europe; our second, never to suffer Eu-  
rope to intermeddle with Cisatlantic affairs.  
  
‘i While Europe is laboring to become  
the domicile of despotism, our endeavor  
should be to make our hemisphere that of  
freedom. One nation (Great Britain), most  
of all, could disturb us in this pursuit; she  
now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us  
in it. By acceding to her proposition we de-  
tach her from the bands, bring her mighty  
weight into the scale of free government,  
and emancipate a continent at a stroke.  
  
Great Britain is the nation which  
can do us the most harm of any one or all  
on earth, and with her on our side we need  
not fear the world. With her, then, we  
should most sedulously cherish a cordial  
friendship, and nothing would tend more to  
knit our affections than to be fighting once  
more side by side in the same cause.
