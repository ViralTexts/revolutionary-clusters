July 2d. Genl. Lincoln’s detachment embarked last Night after dark, at or near Tellers point; and as his operations were to be the movement of two Nights he was desired to repair to Fort Lee this day &amp; reconnoitre the enemy’s Works—Position and strength as well as he possibly could &amp; take his ultimate determination from appearances—that is to attempt the surprize if the prospect was favourable or to relinquish it if it was not, and in the latter case to land above the Mouth of Spikendevil &amp; cover the Duke in his operation on Delancys Corps.  
At three o’clock this Morning I commenced my March with the Continental Army in order to cover the detached Troops and improve any advantages which might be gained by them. Made a small halt at the New bridge over Croton abt. 9 Miles from Peekskill—another at the Church by Tarry Town till Dusk (9 Miles more) and compleated the remaining part of the March in the Night—arriving at Valentines Hill (at Mile square) about Sun rise.  
Our Baggage &amp; Tents were left standing at the Camp at Peekskill.

3d. The length of Duke Lauzens March &amp; the fatiegue of his Corps, prevented his coming to the point of Action at the hour appointed. In the meantime Genl. Lincolns Party who were  
  
ordered to prevent the retreat of Delancy’s Corps by the way of Kg. Bridge &amp; prevent succour by that Rout were attacked by the Yagers and others but on the March of the Army from Valentines Hill retired to the Island. Being disappointed in both objects from the Causes mentioned I did not care to fatiegue the Troops any more but suffered them to remain on their Arms while I spent good part of the day in reconnoitering the Enemys works.  
  
In the afternoon we retired to Valentines Hill &amp; lay upon our Arms. Duke Lauzen &amp; Waterbury lay on the East side of the Brunxs [Bronx] river on the East Chester road. Our loss in this days skirmishing was as follows—viz.—

10th. A Letter from Governor Trumbull, inclosing the proceedings of a convention of Eastern Deligates gives better hope of a regular supply of provision than we have been accustomed to for more than two years as the business seem to be taken up Systematically and regular modes adopted to furnish supplies at stated periods.

These troops were being held in readiness for a reconnaissance by French and American forces of the New York defenses. See “Instructions for Reconnoitering the Enemy’s Post at the North End of York Island,” 13 July 1781 (owned by Mr. Richard Maass, White Plains, N.Y.).

Two of the Carriages however were a good deal damaged by the fire. The Enemy however by sending their armed Boats up the River took the Vessel of a Captn. Dobbs laden with Bread for the French Army—Cloathing for Sheldons Regiment &amp; some passengers. This was done in the Night—it being after Sunset before the Vessels passed the Post at Dobs ferry.

16th. The Cannon &amp; Stores were got out of the Vessels &amp; every thing being removed from Tarry town, two french twelve pounders, &amp; one of our 18 prs. wer[e] brought to bear upon the Ships which lay of Tarry town, distant about a Mile, and obliged them to remove lower down &amp; move over to the West shore.  
  
  
  
17th. The Vessels being again fired at in the position they took yesterday run up the River to Tellers point &amp; there came to burning the House of the Widow Noy⟨e⟩ll.  
  
  
  
18th. I passed the North River with Count de Rochambeau Genl. de Beville his Qr. Mr. Genl. &amp; Genl. Duportail in order to reconnoitre the Enemy Posts and Encampments at the North end of York Island. Took an Escort of 150 Men from the Jersey Troops on the other side.  
From different views the following discoveries were made—viz.—  
That two Ships of 20 Guns &amp; upwards lay opposite to the Mouth of spikendevil—one pretty near the East Shore the other abt. the same distance from the West; the first is intended to guard the Mouth of Spikendevil equally with the No. River. Below these, &amp; directly opposite to Fort Washington (or Knyphausen) lay two transports with about 6 Guns &amp; few Men in each. The Eastermost Ship seems designed to Guard the landing at the little bay above Jefferys Rock. About the center of the Ground leading to Jeffreys Rock or point a Guard Mounts. It appears to be no more than a Sergeants guard with one centry in front where there is a small Work—the Guard House standing within.  
These are all the Guards and all the security I could discover upon the No. River—on the right flank of the Enemy. The Shore from Jeffreys rock downwards, was quite open, and free—without Hutts of any kind—Houses or Troops—none being encamped below the heights. There did not even appear springs, or washing places any where on the face of the Hill which were resorted to.  
The Island is totally stripped of Trees, &amp; wood of every kind; but low bushes (apparently as high as a Mans waste) appear in places which were covered with Wood in the year 1776.  
The Side of the Hill from the Barrier below Fort Tryon, to  
  
the Bay opposite to fort Knyphausen, is difficult of access; but there seems to be a place abt. 200 yds. above the bay, which has the best appearance of a landing, and is most private—but a hut or two on the heights abt. 200 yds. above Fort Knyphausen, &amp; a little above the old long Battery, which was thrown up in 1776 must be avoided by leaving it on the left in getting to the Fort last mentioned.  
In the hollow below Morris’s heights (between that &amp; Haerlam) is a good place to land but near the York Road opposite there appeared to be a few Tents and many Dragoon Horses seemed to be at Pasture in the low land between the heights. A landing perfectly concealed, but not so good, might be made a little higher up the river, and nearer to those heights which ought to be immediately occupied—(between the old American lines and the aforesaid hollow).  
From the point within the Mouth of Spiken devil, the way to the Fort on Cox’s Hill seems difficult, and the first part of it covered with bushes. There is a better way up from the outer point, but too much exposed to a discovery from the Ship which lays opposite to it, and on acct. of its being less covered with wood.  
The ground round the Fort on Cox’s hill is clear of Bushes. There is an abatis round the Work, but no friezing; nor could I discover whether there is a ditch. At the No. Et. corner there appeared to be no Parapet &amp; the whole seemed to be in a decaying State. The gate is next the No. River.  
Forts Tryon, Knyphausen &amp; Ft. George on Laurell, with the Batteries in the line of Pallisading across from River to river appeared to be well friezed, ditched &amp; abattied—In a word to be strong and in good repair.  
Fort No. 8 is also abatied &amp; friezed at the Top. The gate is next Haerlam River. There are no Houses or Huts on the side of the Hill from this work till you come near old Fort Independence.  
On McGowans heights there appears (by the extent of the Tents) to be two Battns. Encamped—supposed to be the British Grenadiers. A little in the rear of this, and on the (enemys) left, are a number of Huts but whether they are Inhabited or not could not be ascertained there being different opinions on this point, from the nearest view we could get of it. On the height opposite to Morris’s white House there appeared to be another Regt. (supposed to be the 38th. British). Between this and Fort Knyphausen (abt. half way) are two small Encampments contiguous  
  
to each other—both together containing two or 3 and 40 Tents—Hessians. On Laurel Hill near Fort George is another Encampment in view abt. 40 Tents &amp; huts which appear to be Inhabited also—by (it is said)—the 57th. Regiment. The other, and only remaining Encampment in View, &amp; discoverable from the West side of the river, is betwn. the Barrier and Kings bridge—in the Hollow between Cox’s hill and the heights below. One hundred Tents could be counted in view at the same time, and others might be hid by the Hills. At this place it is said the Jagers—Hessian &amp; Anspach lay.

20th. Count de Rochambeau having called upon me, in the name of Count de Barras, for a definitive plan of Campaign, that he might communicate it to the Count de Grasse—I could not but acknowledge, that the uncertainties under which we labour—the few Men who have joined (either as recruits for the Continental Battns. or Militia) &amp; the ignorance in which I am kept by some of the States on whom I mostly depended—especially Massachusetts from whose Govr. I have not received a line since I addressed him from Weathersfd. the 23d. of May last—rendered it impracticable for me to do more than to prepare, first, for the enterprize against New York as agreed to at Weathersfield and secondly for the relief of the Southern States if after all my efforts, &amp; earnest application to these States it should be found at the arrivl. of Count de Grasse that I had neither men, nor means adequate to the first object. To give this opinion I was further induced from the uncertainty with respect to the time of the arrival of the French Fleet &amp; whether Land Troops would come in it or not as had been earnestly requested by me &amp; inforced by the Minister of France.  
The uncertainty of sufficient aids, of Men &amp; Means from the States to whom application had been made, and the discouraging prospects before me of having my requisitions complied with—added to an unwillingness to incur any expence that could be avoided induced me to desire Genl. Knox to suspend the Transport of the heavy Cannon &amp; Stores from Philadelphia lest we should have them to carry back again or be encumbd. with them in the field.

Again ordered abt. 5000 Men to be ready to March at 8 oclock, for the purpose of reconnoitering the enemys Posts at Kings bridge and to cut off, if possible, such of Delancys Corps as should be found without their lines.  
At the hour appointed the March commenced in 4 Columns, on different roads. Majr. Genl. Parsons with the Connecticut Troops &amp; 25 of Sheldon’s horse formed the right column (with two field pieces) on the No. River road. The other Two divisions of the Army, under the Majr. Generals Lincoln &amp; Howe, together with the Corps of Sappers and Miners, and 4 field pieces, formed the next column on the Sawmill river road. The right column of the French (on our left) consisted of the Brigade of Bourbonnis, with the Battn. of Grenadiers and Choissairs, 2 field pieces &amp; 2 twelve pounders. Their left column was composed of the Legion of Lauzen—one Battn. of Grenadiers, &amp; Choissairs of Soussonnis, 2 field pieces &amp; 2 Howitzers. General Waterbury with the Militia and State Troops of Connecticut, were to March on the East chester Road and to be joined at that place by the Cavalry of Sheldon, for the purpose of Scouring Frogs Neck. Sheldons Infantry was to join the Legion of Lauzen for the purpose of Scouring Morrissania, and to be covered by Scammells light Infantry who were to advance thro’ the fields &amp; way lay the Roads—stop all communication &amp; prevent Intelligence getting to the Enemy.  
At Mile Square (Valentine’s hill) The left column of the American Troops, and right of the french formed their junction, as did the left of the French also, by mistake as it was intended it should cross the Brunx by Garrineaus, &amp; recross it at Williams’s bridge.  
The whole Army (Parson’s division first) arrived at Kingsbridge about day light &amp; formed on the heights back of Fort Independance—extending towards delancy’s Mills—While the Legion of Lauzen &amp; Waterbury proceeded to scour the Necks of  
  
Morrissania &amp; throgs to little effect, as most of the Refugees were fled, &amp; hid in such obscure places as not to be discovered; &amp; by stealth got over to the Islands adjacent, &amp; to the enemys shipping which lay in the East River. A few however were caught and some cattle &amp; Horses brought off.

22d. The enemy did not appear to have had the least intelligence of our movement or to know we were upon the height opposite to them till the whole Army were ready to display.  
After having fixed upon the ground, &amp; formed our line, I began, with General Rochambeau and the Engineers, to reconnoitre the enemy’s position and Works first from Tippets hill opposite to their left and from hence it was evident that the small redoubt (Fort Charles)  near Kings bridge would be absolutely at the  
  
command of a battery which might be erected thereon. It also appeared equally evident that the Fort on Cox’s hill was in bad repair, &amp; little dependence placed in it. There is neither ditch nor friezing to it, and the No. East Corner appears quite easy of access (occasioned as it would seem by a Rock). The approach from the inner Point (mentioned in the Reconnoitre from the Jersey shore) is secured by a ledge of Rocks which would conceal a party from the observation &amp; view of the ship till it got within abt. 100 Yds. of the Fort round which for that, or a greater distance the ground has little covering upon it of bushes. There is a house on this side under Tippets hill but out of view, I conceive of the crossing place most favourable to a partizan stroke. From this view, and every other I could get of Forts Tryon, Knyphausen &amp; Laurel hill the Works are formidable.  
There is no Barracks or huts on the East side of the Hill on which Fort Tryon and Knyphausen stands—nor are there any on the hill opposite except those by Fort George. Near the Blew bell there is a number of Houses but they have more the appearance of Stables than Barracks. In the hollow, near the Barrier gate, are about 14 or 15 Tents; which is the only Encampment I could see without the line of Pallisading as the large one discovered on the 18th. through the brake of the Hill betwn. Fort Tryon &amp; Coxss hill was not to be seen from any view I had.  
A continued Hill from the Creek, East of Haerlam River, &amp; a little below Morris’s White House, has from every part of it, the command of the opposite shore, &amp; all the plain adjoining, within range of shot from batteries which may be erected thereon. The general width of the river along this range of Hills, appears to be from one to two hundred yards. The opposite shore (tho’ more or less marshy) does not seem miry, &amp; the banks are very easy of access. How far the Battery, under cover of the block Ho[use] on the hill No. West of Harlaem town is capable of scouring the plain, is difficult to determine from this side, but it would seem as if the distance was too great to be within the range of its shot on that part of the plain nearest the Creek before mentioned &amp; which is also nearest the height back of our old lines thrown up in the year 1776. It unfortunately happens that in the rear of the (continued) hill before mentioned, there is a deep swamp, and the grounds East of that swamp, are not so high as the heights near Harlaem river. In the rear of this again is the Brunx which is not be crossed without Boats below De Lancys Mills.

1781, July 2—General Linco!n’s detachment

movements of two nights, he was directed to  
repair to Fort Lee this day, and reconnoitre the

attacked by the Yagers and others; but on the

1781, July 21. I ordered about five thousand  
men to be ready to march at eight o’clock for the  
purpose of reconnoitring the enemy’s posts at  
Kingsbridge, and of cutting off, if possible, such  
of Delancey’s corps as&#x27;should be found without  
their lines. At the hour appointed the march  
commenced in four columns on different roads,  
Major-General Parsons with the Connecticut  
troops, and twenty-five of Sheldon’s horse,  
formed the right column, with two field pieces,  
on the North River road. The other two divi-  
sions under Major-Generals Lincoln and Howe,  
together with the corps of sappers and miners  
and four field pieces, formed the next column  
on the Saw-Mill River road, The right column  
of the French, on our left, consisted of the  
bri ade of Bourbonnais, with the battalion of  
grenadiers and chasseurs, the regiment of Sois-  
sonnais, two field pieces and two twelve-pounders.  
General Waterbury with the militia and State  
troops of Connecticut was to march on the East  
Chester road, and to be joined at that place by  
the cavalry of Sheldon for the purpose of scour-  
ing Frog’s Neck. Sheldon’s infantry was to  
join the legion of Lauzun and scour Morrisa-  
nia, and to be covered by Scammell’s light  
infantry who were to advance through the fields,  
waylay the roads, stop all communications and  
prevent intelligence from getting to the enemy.  
At Valentine’s Hill the left column of the  
American troops and the right column. of the  
French formed their junction, as did the left of  
the French also by mistake, as it was intended  
it should cross the Bronx by Garrineau’s and  
recross it at Williams’ Bridge. The whole army  
(Parsons’s division first) arrived at Kingsbridge  
about daylight, and formed on the heights back  
of Fort Independence, extending towards De-

lancey’s Mills ; while the legion of Lauzun and  
Waterbury’s corps proceeded to scour Morrisania  
and Frog’s Neck to little effect, as most of the  
Refugees had fled, and hid themselvs in such  
obscure places as not to be discovered; and by  
Stealth got over to the islands adjacent, and to  
the enemy’s shipping which lay in East River.  
A few, however, were caught, and some cattle  
and horses brought off.

July 22.—The enemy did not appear to have  
had the least intelligence of our movement, or to  
know we were upon the heights opposite to them,  
until the whole army was ready to display it-  
self. After having fixed upon the ground, and  
formed our line, I began with General Rocham-  
beau and the engineers to reconnoitre the ene-  
my’s position and works; and first from Tip-  
pet’s Hill, opposite to their left. From thence it  
was evident that the small redoubt (Fort Charles),  
near Kingsbridge, would be absolutely at the  
command of a battery which might be erected  
thereon, It also appeared equally evident that  
the fort on Cox’s Hill was in bad repair, and  
little dependence placed upon it. There is  
neither ditch nor friezing, and the northeast  
corner appears quite easy of access, occasioned,  
as it would seem, by a rock. The approach  
from the inner point is secured by a ledge of  
rocks, which would conceal a party from observa-  
tion till it got within about one hundred yards  
of the forf, around which for that or a greater  
distance this ground has little covering of bushes  
upon it. There isa house on this side under Tip-  
pet’s Hill, but out of view, I conceive, of the cross-  
ing place most favorable to a partisan stroke.  
From this view, and every other I could get of  
Forts Tryon, Knyphausen and Laurel Hill, the  
works are formidable. There are no barracks  
or tents on the east side of the hill on which  
Forts Tryon and Knyphausen stand, nor are  
there any on the hill opposite, except those by  
Fort George. Near the Blue Bell there is a  
number of houses, but they have more the ap-  
pearance of stables than barracks, In the hol-  
low, near the barrier gate, are about fourteen or  
fifteen tents, which are the only encampment I  
could see without the line of palisades. A con-  
tinued hill from the Creek, east of Haerlem  
River, and a little below Morris’s White House,

has from every part of it the command of the  
opposite shore, and all the plain adjoining is  
within range of shot from batteries which may  
be erected thereon. The general width of the  
river, along this range of hills, appears to be  
from one hundred to two hundred yards. The  
opposite shore, though more or less marshy,  
does not seem miry, and the banks are very  
easy of access. How far the battery, under  
cover of the blockhouse on the hill northeast  
of Haerlem Town, is capable of scouring the  
plain, is difficult to determine from this side ;  
but it would seem as if the distance were too  
great to be within the range of its shot on that  
part of the plain nearest the creek before men-  
tioned, and which is also nearest the heights  
back of our old lines thrown up in the year  
1776. It unfortunately happens that in the rear  
of the continued hill before mentioned there is  
adeep swamp, and the grounds west of that  
swamp are not so high as the heights near Haer-  
lem River. In the rear of this again is the  
Bronx, which is not to be crossed without boats  
below Delancey’s Mill.

July 23—Went upon the Frog’s Neck to see  
what communication could be had with Long  
Island, and the engineers attended with instru-  
ments to measure the distance across, Having  
finished the reconnoitre without damage, a few  
harmless shot only being fired at us, we marched  
back about six o’clock by the same routes we  
went down, but in a reversed order of march,  
and arrived at camp about midnight.

JULY  
  
July 2d—Genl. Lincoln’s detachment  
embarked last night after dark at or near  
Tellar’s point ; and as his operations  
were to be the movement of two nights  
he was desired to repair to Fort Lee this  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
day and reconnoitre the enemy’s works.  
—Position and strength as well as he  
possibly could &amp; take his ultimate deter-  
mination from appearances—that is—to  
attempt the surprize if the prospect was  
favourable—or to relinquish it if it was  
not, and in the latter case to land above  
the mouth of Spiken devil &amp; cover the  
Duke in his operation on Delancys  
Corps.  
  
At three o’clock this morning I com-  
menced my march with the Continental  
Army in order to cover the detached  
Troops—and improve any advantages  
which might be gained by them—madea  
small halt at the New bridge over Croton  
abt. 9 miles from Peekskill—another at  
the Church by Tarry Town till Dusk (9  
miles more) and compleated the remain-  
ing part of the mar[ch] in the night—ar-  
riving at Valentines Hill (at Mile square)  
about sunrise,  
  
Our Baggage &amp; Tents were left stand-  
ing at the Camp at Peekskill.  
  
July 3¢—The length of Duke Lau-  
zens march &amp; the fatigue of his Corps,  
prevented his coming to the point of ac-  
tion at the hour appointed.  
  
In the meantime Genl. Lincolns Party  
who were ordered to prevent the retreat  
of Delancy’s Corps by the way of Kgs  
Bridge &amp; prevent succour by that route  
were attacked by the Yagers and others  
—but on the march of the Army from  
Valentines Hill retired to the Island.—  
Being disappointed in both objects from  
the causes mentioned I did not care to  
fatigue the Troops any more but suf-  
fered them to remain on their arms while  
I spent good part of the day in recon-  
noitering the Enemys works.—In the  
afternoon we retired to Valentines Hill

July 14th—Near 5000 men being or-  
dered to march for Kingsbridge, to cover  
and secure a reconnoitre of the Enemys  
works on the No. end of York Island,  
Harlaem river, &amp; the Sound, were pre-  
vented doing so by incessant rain—  
  
July 15th—The Savage sloop of war  
of 16 Guns—the ship Genl. Washington,  
lately taken by the Enemy—a ten Gal-  
ley—and two other sma[lkl] armed Ves-  
sels passed our post at Dobbs Ferry  
(which was not in a condition to oppose  
them)— At the same time three or four  
river Vessels with 4 Eighteen pounders  
—stores &amp;c had just arrived at Tarry-  
town and with infinite difficulty, &amp; by  
great exertion of Colo. Sheldon, Captn.

Lieut. Miles of the Artillery—&amp; Lt.

100 yards from the Dock, and were set  
fire to by the Enemy, but extinguished  
by the extraordinary activity &amp; spirit of  
the above Gentln—two of the Car-  
riages however were a good deal dam-  
aged by the fire—-  
  
The Enemy, however, by sending  
their armed Boats up the River took the  
Vessel of a Captn Dobbs laden with  
Bread for the French Army—clothing  
for Sheldons Regiment &amp; some passen-  
gers.—this was done in the Night.—it  
being after sunset before ‘the vessels  
passed the Post at Dobbs ferry.—  
  
july 16th — The Cannon &amp; Stores  
were got out of the Vessels &amp; every-  
thing being removed from Tarrytown,  
two French twelve pounders, &amp; one of  
  
our 18 prs were brought to bear upon the  
ships which lay of Tarrytown, distant  
about a mile, and obliged them to re-  
move lower down &amp; more over to the  
  
West shore.—  
  
July 17th—The vessels being again  
fired at in the position they took yes-  
terday, run up the river to Teller’s  
point, &amp; there come to burning the  
House of the widow Neyall.—(Noyelles).  
  
July 18th—I passed the North River  
with Count de Rochambeau—Genl. de  
Beville, his Qr. Mr. Genl. &amp; Genl. Du-  
portail in order to reconnoitre the En-  
emy Posts and Encampments at the  
North end of York Island—took an Es-  
cort of 150 Men from the Jersey Troops  
on the other side.  
  
From different views the following dis-  
coveries were made—viz :— That two  
Ships of 20 Guns &amp; upwards lay oppo-  
  
ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
site to the mouth of Spiken devil—one  
pretty near the East shore, the other  
abt the same distance from the West ;  
the first is intended to guard the mouth  
of Spiken devil equally with the No.  
River.— Below these &amp; directly oppo-  
site to Fort Washington (or Knyphausen)  
lay two transports with about 6 Guns  
&amp; few men in each, the Eastermost  
ship seems designed to Guard the land-  
ing at the little bay above Jeffereys Rock.  
— About the center of the Ground lead-  
ing to Jeffrey’s Rock or point a Guard  
mounts—  
  
It appears to be no more than a Ser-  
geants guard, with one centry in front,  
where there is a small Work—the Guard  
House standing within—  
  
These are all the Guards—and all the  
security I could discover upon the No.  
River—on the right flank of the En-  
emy. — the shore from Jeffreys rock  
downwards was quite open and free—  
without Hutts of any kind—Houses or  
Troops—none being encamped below  
the heights— There did not even ap-  
pear springs, or washing places any  
where on the face of the Hill which were  
resorted to.— .  
  
The Island is totally stripped of Trees,  
&amp; wood of every kind ; but low bushes  
(apparently as high as a mans waste) ap-  
pear in places which were covered with  
wood in the year 1776.  
  
The side of the Hill from the Barrier  
below Fort Tryon, to the Bay opposite  
to fort Knyphausen is difficult of access ;  
but there seems to be a place abt 200  
yds above the bay, which has the best  
appearance of a landing, and is most  
private—but a hut or two on the heights  
abt. 200 yds above Fort Knyphausen, &amp;  
  
  
  
* ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS  
  
a little above the old long Battery, which  
was thrown up in 1776 must be avoided  
by leaving it on the left in getting to the  
Fort last mentioned.  
  
In the hollow below Morris’s heights  
(between that &amp; Haerlam) is a good  
place to land; but near the York road  
opposite there appeared to be a few  
Tents — and many Dragoon Horses  
seemed to be at Pasture in the low land  
between the heights.—a landing perfect-  
ly concealed but not so good, might be  
made a little higher up the river, and  
nearer to those heights which ought to  
be immediately occupied—(between the  
old American lines and the aforesaid  
hollow)  
  
From the point within the mouth of  
Spiken devil, the way to the Fort on  
Cox’s Hill seems difficult, and the first  
part of it covered with bushes—there is  
a better way up from the outer point, but  
too much exposed to a discovery from  
the ship which lays opposite to it, and  
on acct of its being less covered with  
wood.—  
  
The ground round the Fort on Cox’s  
hill is clear of Bushes—there is an abatis  
round the work, but no friezing; nor  
could I discover whether there is a ditch.  
—At the No. Et corner there appeared  
to be no Parapet—&amp; the whole seemed  
to be in a decaying state—the gate is  
next the No. River.  
  
Forts Tryon, Knyphausen &amp; Ft. George  
on Laurell, with the Batteries in the line  
of Pallisading across from River to river  
appeared to be well friezed, ditched &amp;  
abattied—In a word to be strong and in  
good repair.  
  
Fort No, 8. is also abatied &amp; friezed  
at the Top—the gate is next Haerlam  
  
I2I  
  
river—there arc no Houses or Huts on  
the side of the Hill from this work till  
you come near old Fort Independence.  
  
On McGowans heights there appears  
(by the extent of the Tents) to be two  
Battns encamped.—supposed to be Brit-  
ish Grenadiers—a little in the rear of  
this and on the (enemys) left, are a num-  
ber of Huts—but whether they are In-  
habited or not could not be ascertained  
—there being different opinions on this  
point from the nearest view we could get  
of it.—On the height opposite to Morris’  
White House there appeared to be an-  
other Regt. (supposed to be the 38th.  
British) Between this and Fort Knyp-  
hausen (abt. half way) are two small En-  
campments contiguous to each other—  
both together containing two or 3 and 40  
Tents. —Hessians—On Laurel Hill near  
Fort George is another Encampment in  
view abt 40 Tents &amp; Huts which appear  
to be Inhabited also—by (it is said)—the  
57th Regiment.—  
  
The other, and only remaining En-  
campment in view, discoverable from  
the west side of the river, is betwn the  
Barrier and King’s bridge—in the Hol-  
low between Cox’s Hill and the heights  
below—  
  
One hundred Tents could be counted

July 22d—The enemy did not appear  
to have had the least intelligence of our  
movement—or to know we were upon  
the heights opposite to them till the  
whole Army were ready to display.  
  
After having fixed upon the ground,  
&amp; formed our line, I began, with General  
Rochambeau and the Engineers, to re-  
connoitre the enemy’s position and works,  
first from Tippet’s hill opposite to their  
left—and from hence it was evident that  
the small redoubt (Fort Charles) near  
Kingsbridge would be absolutely at the  
command of a battery which might be  
erected thereon.— It also appeared  
equally evident that the Fort on Cox’s  
hill was in bad repair, &amp; little depend-  
ence placed in it—there is neither ditch  
nor friezing to it, and the No. East  
Corner appears quite easy of access (oc-  
casioned, as it would seem) by a rock.—  
the approach from the inner Point (men-  
tioned in the reconnoitre from the Jer-  
sey shore) is secured by a ledge of  
Rocks, which would conceal a party from  
the observation &amp; view of the ship till it  
got within abt. 100 yds of the Fort, round  
which for that or a greater distance  
the ground has little covering upon it  
of bushes—there is a house on this side  
under Tippets hill, but out of view, I  
conceive, of the crossing place most fa-  
vourable to a partizan stroke— From  
this view and every other I could get of  
Forts Tryon, Knyphausen &amp; Laurel hill,  
the works are formidable.—  
  
There is no Barracks or huts on the  
East side of the Hill on which Forts  
Tryon and Knyphausen stands—nor are  
  
  
  
124  
  
there any on the hill opposite except  
those by Fort George.— Near the Blew  
bell there is a number of Houses, but  
they have more the appearance of Sta-  
bles than Barracks.— In the hollow,  
near the Barrier gate, are about 14  
or 15 Tents; which is the only Encamp-  
ment I could see without the line of  
Pallisading, as the large one discov-  
ered on the 18th through the brake of  
the Hill betwn Fort Tryon &amp; Coxs’s hill  
was not to be seen from any view I had.—  
  
A continued Hill from the Creek East  
of Haerlam River, &amp; a little below Mor-  
ris’s White House, has from every part  
of it the command of the opposite  
shore, and all the plain adjoining within  
range of shot from batteries which may  
be erected thereon— The general width  
of the river along this range of Hills  
appears to be from one to two hundred  
yards—the opposite shore (tho’ more or  
less marshy) does not seem miry, &amp; the  
banks are very easy of access—how far  
the Battery under cover of the block  
Ho. on the hill No. West of Harlaem  
town is capable of scouring the plain is  
difficult to determine from this side, but  
it would seem as if the distance was too  
great to be within the range of its shot  
on that part of the plain nearest the  
Creek before mentioned, &amp; which is  
also nearest the height back of our old  
lines thrown up in the year 1776.— It  
unfortunately happens that in the rear  
of the (continued) hill before men-  
tioned there is a deep swamp, and the  
ground, East of that swamp are not so  
high as the heights near Harlaem river  
— In the rear of this again is the Brunx,  
which is not to be crossed without Boats  
below De Lancy’s Mills.

up those which are now in Virginia, lest
