r recaptures. After “before” insert, “or which shall be undetermined at.”]  
If it shall manifestly appear that of any entire thing of which division cannot be made without injury to its value a subject of the enemy and a citizen or a subject of a foreign power not being an enemy are joint holders, the whole shall be condemned and sold for gold or silver; the proper proportion of the net proceeds of which shall be deposited in the treasury of the State in which the sale shall be, to be paid to the order of such citizen or the subject of such foreign power.  
If such division can be accomplished, but neither the citizen nor the subject of foreign powers nor his agent shall require specific restitution of his property there shall be a sale in the same manner as if the property were indivisible. But if in such case a requisition be made to this effect, the due proportion shall be specifically restored according to the ratio of the number and value of the property [JM suggested, Strike out the words after restored to the end of paragraph.]  
Whose property shall have been originally captured on land from a citizen of the United States and shall be recaptured below high water mark by another citizen thereof restitution shall be made to the former owner upon the payment of a reasonable salvage not exceeding one fourth part of the value, no regard being had to the time of possession by the enemy [JM suggested, After value—no regard being had to the time of possession by the Enemy &amp; (.)]  
  
In all cases of recapture by an armed vessel fitted out at the expence of the United States of a vessel or other effects belonging to a citizen the Court shall adjudge the proportion which would be due to the United States of such recapture to be remitted to the original owner such citizen; no regard being had to the time of possession by the enemy. [JM’s amended form read: Strike out the parag: &amp; substitute the followg. “In all cases of recapture by an armed Vessel fitted out at the expence of the U. S. of a Vessel or other effects belonging to a Citizen, the Court shall adjudge the proportion wch would be due to the U. S. to be remitted to such Citizen; no regard being had to the time of possession by the Enemy

if by the crews of British vessels, the whole shall be adjudged to the captors (except in those instances in which the capture may belong to an American citizen), to be divided at the discretion of the Court. [JM moved, Strike out the parenthesis]

it shall manifestly appear, that of any entire thing of which di-  
vision cannot be made without injury to its value, a subject of  
the enemy, and a citizen or a subject of a foreign power, not  
being an enemy, are joint holders, the whole shall be condemn-  
ed and sold for gold or silver, the proper proportion of the  
net proceeds of which shall be deposited in the treasury of the  
State in which the sale shall be, to be paid to the order of such  
citizen, or the subject of such foreign power.  
  
If such division can be accomplished, but neither the citizen,  
nor the subject of a foreign power, nor his agent, shall require  
specific restitution of his property, there shall be a sale in the  
same manner as if the property were indivisible. But if, in  
such case, a requisition be made to this effect, the due propor-  
tion shall be specifically restored.  
  
Where property shall have been originally captured on land  
from a State, or a citizen of the United States, and shall be re-  
captured below high water mark by another citizen thereof,  
restitution shall be made to the former owner, upon the pay-  
ment of a reasonable salvage, not exceeding one-fourth part of  
the value ; no regard being had to the time of possession by  
the enemy.  
  
In all cases of recapture by an armed vessel, fitted out at  
ihe expense of the United States, of a vessel, or other effects,  
belonging to a citizen, the Court shall adjudge the proportion  
which would be due to the United States, to be remitted to
