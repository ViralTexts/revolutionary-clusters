The act providing the means of intercourse between the United States and foreign nations, of 19th. March 1798, which was in force when Doctor Stevens was appointed, appropriates the annual sum of 40,000 dollars for the support of such persons as the President shall commission to serve the United States in foreign Parts, and for the expence incident to the business in which they may be employed: Which confines the expenditure to persons appointed pursuant to the Constitution, and to the expence incident to the legal mission of Such Persons.

it seems to follow as a necessary consequence that the United States  
ought to ratify it.  
Four days later the Senate approved it unanimously.  
  
The Constitution vested in the President and Senate the  
power of appointing ambassadors, other public ministers and  
consuls. Congress gave vitality to this clause by “an act  
providing the means of intercourse between the United States  
and foreign nations,’ approved July 1, 1790. By that act the  
President was —  
  
authorized to draw from the treasury of the United States a sum not  
exceeding forty thousand dollars annually, to be paid out of the  
moneys arising from the duties on imposts and tonnage, for the  
support of such persons as he shall commission to serve the United  
States in foreign ports and for the expense incident to the business  
in which they may be employed.”  
A part of the money thus placed at the disposal of the Presi-  
dent might have been used in paying the salaries of consuls,  
but none was so applied. The consular officers derived their  
remuneration from fees and from the profits of the business in  
which they were permitted to engage. During the first three  
years of his administration Washington appointed seventeen  
consuls and five vice-consuls.®  
  
Washington recognized the necessity of legislation for the  
further organization of the consular service. In his brief  
address to Congress at the opening of its third session
