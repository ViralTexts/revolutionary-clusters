To the Senate and House of Repre-  
sentatives of the United States.  
  
I have heretofore communicated  
to congress the decrees of the go-  
vernment of France of Novem-  
ber 21, 1806, and of Spain of Feb-  
ruary 19, 1807, with the orders of  
the British government of January  
and November, 1807.  
  
I now transmit a decree of the  
emperor of France of December  
17, 1807, and a similar decree of  
the third of January last, by his  
catholic majesty. Although the  
decree of France has not been re-  
ceived by official communication,  
yet the different channels of pro-  
mulgation through which the pub-  
lic are possessed of it, with the  
formal testimony furnished by the  
government of Spain in their de-  
cree, leave us without a doubt that  
such a one has been issued.  
These decrees and orders, taken  
together, want little of amounting  
to a declaration, that every neutral  
nation found on the high seas,  
whatsoever be her cargo, and  
whatsoever foreign port be that of  
her departure or destination, shall  
be deemed lawful prize; and they  
prove more and more the expedi-  
ency of retaining our vessels, our  
seamen, and property within our  
own harbours, until the dangers to  
which they are exposed can be re-  
moved or lessened.
