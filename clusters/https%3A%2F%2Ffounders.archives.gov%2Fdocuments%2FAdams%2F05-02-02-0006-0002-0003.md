 however is certain, that the Stat. of the 14th. Char. 2nd. has established this Writ almost in the words of the Writ itself. “And it shall be lawful to and for any person or persons authorised by Writ of Assistance under the seal of his Majesty’s Court of Exchequer to take a Constable, Headborough, or other public Officer, inhabiting near unto the place, and in the day time to enter and go into any house, Shop, Cellar, Warehouse, room, or any other place, and in case of Resistance, to break open doors, Chests, Trunks and other Package, and there to seize any kind of Goods or Merchandize whatever prohibited, and to put the same into his Majesty’s Warehouse in the Port where Sei

 Houses, or Warehouses, to search for and seize any such Goods, and that the like Assistance shall be given to the said Officers as is the Custom in England.”  
Now what is the Assistance which the Officers of the Revenue are to have here, which is like that they have in England? Writs of Assistance under the Seal of his Majesty’s Court of Exchequer at home will not run here. They must therefore be under the Seal of this Court. For by the law of this Province 2 W. 3d. Ch. 3 “there shall be a Superior Court &amp;c. over the whole Province &amp;c. who shall have cognizance of all pleas &amp;c. and generally of all other matters, as fully and amply to all intents and purposes as the Courts of King’s Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer within his Majesty’s Kingdom of England have or ought to have.”  
It is true the common privileges of Englishmen are taken away in this Case, but even their privileges are not so in cases of Crime and fine. ’Tis the necessity of the Case and the benefit of the Revenue that justifies this Writ. Is not the Revenue the sole support of Fleets and Armies abroad, and Ministers at home? without which the Nation could neither be preserved from the Invasions of her foes, nor the Tumults of her own Subjects. Is not this I say infinitely more important, than the imprisonment of Thieves, or even Murderers? yet in these Cases ’tis agreed Houses may be broke open.  
In fine the power now under consideration is the same with that given by the Law of this Province to Treasurers towards Collectors, and to them towards the subject. A Collector may when he pleases distrain my goods and Chattels, and in want of them arrest my person, and throw me instantly into Goal. What! shall my property be wrested from me!—shall my Liberty be destroyed by a Collector, for a debt, una

.  
The most material question is whether the practice of the Exchequer is good ground for this Court. But this Court has upon a solemn Argument, which lasted a whole day, renounc’d the Chance of Chancery Jurisdiction which the Exchequer has in Cases where either party is the King’s Debtor.  
In England all Informations of uncustomed or prohibited Goods are in the Exchequer, so that the Custom House Officers are the Officers of that Court under the Eye and Direction of the Barons and so accountable for any wanton exercise of power.  
The Writ now prayed for is not returnable. If the Seizures were so, before your Honors, and this Court should enquire into them you’d often find a wanton exercise of power. At home they seize at their peril, even with probable Cause.

May it please your Honours,  
  
I was desired by one of the court to look into the books, and consider the question now before the court, concerning Writs of Assistance. I have accordingly considered it, and now appear not only in obedience to your order, but also in behalf of the inhabitants of this town, who have presented another petition, and out of regard to the liberties of the subject. And I take this opportunity to declare, that whether under a fee or not, (for in such a cause as this I despise a fee) I will to my dying day oppose, with all the powers and faculties God has given me, all such instruments of slavery on the one hand, and villainy on the other, as this writ of assistance is. It appears to me (may it please your honours) the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles of the constitution, that ever was found in an English law-book. I must therefore beg your honours patience and attention to the whole range of an argument, that may perhaps appear uncommon in many things, as well as points of learning, that are more remote and unusual, that the whole tendency of my design may the more easily be perceived, the conclusions better descend, and the force of them better felt.  
I shall not think much of my pains in this cause as I engaged in it from principle. I was sollicited to engage on the other side. I was sollicited to argue this cause as Advocate-General, and because I would not, I have

f my office; to this charge I can give a very sufficient answer, I renounced that office, and I argue this cause from the same principle; and I argue it with the greater pleasure as it is in favour of British liberty, at a time, when we hear the greatest monarch upon earth declaring from his throne, that he glories in the name of Briton, and that the privileges of his people are dearer to him than the most valuable prerogatives of his crown. And as it is in opposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods of English history, cost one King of England his head and another his throne. I have taken more pains in this cause, than I ever will take again: Although my engaging in this and another popular cause has raised much resentment; but I think I can sincerely declare, that I cheerfully submit myself to every odious name for conscience sake; and from my soul I despise all those whose guilt, malice or folly has made my foes. Let the consequences be what they will, I am determined to proceed. The only principles of public conduct that are worthy a gentleman, or a man are, to sacrifice estate, ease, health and applause, and even life itself to the sacred calls of his country. These manly sentiments in private life make the good citizen, in public life, the patriot and the hero.—I do not say, when brought to the test, I shall be invincible; I pray GOD I may never be brought to the melancholy trial; but if ever I should, it would be then known, how far I can reduce to practice principles I know founded in truth.—In the mean time I will proceed to the subject of the writ. In the first, may it please your Honours, I will admit, that writs of one kind, may be legal, that is, special writs, directed to special officers, and to search certain houses, &amp;c. especially set forth in the writ, may be granted by the Court of Exchequer at home, upon oath made before the Lord Treasurer by the person, who asks, that he suspects such goods to be concealed inthose very places he desires to search. The Act of 14th Car. II. which Mr. Gridley mentions proves this. And in this light the writ appears like a warrant from a justice of peace to search for stolen goods. Your Honours will find in the old book, concerning the office of a justice of p

ed for in this petition being general is illegal. It is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer. I say I admit that special writs of assistance to search special houses, may be granted to certain persons on oath; but I deny that the writ now prayed for can be granted, for I beg leave to make some observations on the writ itself before I proceed to other Acts of Parliament.  
In the first place the writ is universal, being directed “to all and singular justices, sheriffs, constables and all other officers and subjects, &amp;c.” So that in short it is directed to every subject in the king’s dominions; every one with this writ may be a tyrant: If this commission is legal, a tyrant may, in a legal manner also, controul, imprison or murder any one within the realm.  
In the next place, it is perpetual; there’s no return, a man is accountable to no person for his doings, every man may reign secure in his petty tyranny, and spread terror and desolation around him, until the trump of the arch angel shall excite different emotions in his soul.  
In the third place, a person with this writ, in the day time may enter all houses, shops, &amp;c. at will, and command all to assist.  
Fourth, by this not only deputies, &amp;c. but even their menial servants are allowed to lord it over us—What is this but to have the curse of Canaan with a witness on us, to be the servant of servants, the most despicable of God’s creation. Now one of the most essential branches of English liberty, is the freedom of one’s house. A man’s house is his castle; and while he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle. This writ, if it should be declared legal, would totally annihilate this privilege. Custom house officers may enter our houses when they please—we are commanded to permit their entry—their menial servants may enter—may break locks, bars and every thing in their way—and whether they break through malice or revenge, no man, no court can inquire—bare suspicion without oath is sufficient. This wanton exercise of this power is no chimerical suggestion of a heated Brain—I will mention some facts. Mr. Pew had one of these writs, and when Mr. Ware succeeded him, he endorsed this writ over to Mr. Ware, so that these writs are negotiable from one officer to another, and so your Honours have no opportunity of judging the persons to whom this vast power is delegated. Another instance is this.—Mr. Justice Wally had called this same Mr. Ware before him by a constable, to answer for a breach of the Sabbath day acts, or that of profane swearing. As soon as he had done, Mr. Ware asked him if he had done, he replied, yes. Well then, says he, I will shew you a little of my power—I command you to permit me to search your house for unaccustomed goods; and went on to search his house from the garret to the cellar, and then served the constable in the same manner. But to shew another absurdity in this writ, if it should be established, I insist upon it every person by 14th of Car. II. has this power as well as Custom-house officers; the words are, “it shall be lawful for any person or persons authorized, &amp;c.” What a scene does this open! Every man prompted by revenge, ill humour or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbour’s house, may get a writ of assistance; others will ask it from self defence; one arbitrary exertion will provoke another, until society will be involved in tumult and in blood. Again these writs are not returned. Writs in their nature are temporary things; when the purposes for which they are issued are answered, they exist no more; but these monsters in the law live forever, no one can be called to account. Thus reason and the constitution are both against this writ. Let us see what authority there is for it. No more than one instance can be found of it in all our law books, and that was in the zenith of arbitrary power, viz. In the reign of Car. II. when Star-chamber powers were pushed in extremity by some ignorant clerk of the Exchequer. But had this writ been in any book whatever it would have been illegal. All precedents are under the controul of the principles of thelaw. Lord Talbot Says, it is better to observe these than any precedents though in the House of Lords, the last resort of the subject. No Acts of Parliament can establish such a writ; Though it should be made in the very words of the petition it would be void, “An act against the constitution is void.” Vid. Viner. But these prove no more than what I before observed, that special writs may be granted on oath and probable suspicion. The Act of 7th and 8th of William III. that the officers of the plantations shall have the same powers, &amp;c. is confined to this sense, that an officer should show probable grounds, should take his oath on it, should do this before a magistrate, and that such magistrate, if he thinks proper should issue a special warrant to a constable to search the places. That of 6th of Anne can prove no more

sake; and from my soul I despise all those whose  
guilt, malice or folly has made them my foes—Let  
the consequences be what they will, I am deter-  
mined to proceed.  
  
The only principles of public concuct, that are  
worthy of a gentleman, or a man, are to sacrifice es-  
tate, ease, health, and applause, and even life to the  
  
sacred calls of his country. ‘hose manly senti-  
ments, in private life, make the good citizen in  
public life the patriot and the hero. 1 do not say,  
that when brought to the test, I shall be invinci-  
ble: I pray God I may never be brought to the me-  
lancholy trial; but if ever 1 should, it will be then  
‘known how far I can reduce to practice principles  
which I know to be founded on truth—in the  
mean time I will proceed to the subject of this  
writ.  
  
In the first place, may it please your honors, I  
will admit that writs of one kind may be legal; that  
  
‘is, special writs, directed to special officers,  
and ta search certain houses, &amp;c. specially set  
forth in the writ, may be granied by the court of  
‘exchequer at home, upon oath made before the

|Suspects su such goods to be concealed in those very  
pluces he desires to search. The act act of 14th  
‘Charles II, which Mr. Gridley mentions, proves  
Ithis. And. in this light the writ appears like a

Stolen goods. Your honors will find in the old

re “e  
  
quiet he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle. |  
This writ, if it should be declared legal, would to-:  
taily annihilate this privilege; custom-house officers.  
may enter our houses when they please, we are  
commanded to permit their entry. Their menial  
servants may enter, may break locks, bars, and any  
thing in their way, and, whether they break through  
malice or revenge, NO man, no court can inquire—  
bare suspicion without oath is sufficient; this wan-  
ton exercise of this power is not a chimerical sug-  
  
  
  
gestion of a heated brain. I will mention some  
facts—Mr. Pew, had one of these writs, and when  
Mr. Ware succeeded him, he endorsed this writ  
over to Mr. Ware, so that these writs ure negotiable  
from one officer to another; and so your honors  
have no opportunity of judging the persons to  
whom this last power is delegated. Another in-  
stance is this—Mr. justice Wally had called this  
same Mr. Ware before him by a constable to answer  
fora breach of Sabbath day acts, or that of pro-  
fane swearing; as soon as he had finished, Mr. Ware  
asked him if he had done, he replied, yes—well  
then, said Mr. Ware, I will shew you a little of my  
power; I command you to permit me to search your  
house, for uncustomed goods, and went on to search  
his house from the garret to the cellar, and then  
served the constable inthe same manner. But to  
shew another absurdity in this writ, if it should be  
established, I insist upon it every person by the  
14th Charles Il. has this power as well as custom-  
house officers; the words are “‘it shall be lawful far  
any person or persons authorised,” &amp;c. Whatascene  
does this open! every man prompted by revenge,  
ill humour, or wantonness to inspect his neighbor’s  
house, may get a writ of assistants, others will ask  
it from self-defence, one arbitrary exertion will pro-  
voke another, until society be involved in tumult  
and in blood. Again, these writs are not returned.  
Writs in their nature are temporary things. When  
the purposes for which they are issued are answer-  
ed, they exist no more——but these live forever, no  
one can be called to an account—thus reason and  
the constitution are both against this writ. Let us  
see what authority there is for it. Not more than  
one instance can be found of it in all our law  
books, and that was in the zenith of arbitrary pow-  
er, (viz.) in the reign of Charles II. when star-cham-  
ber power was pushed to the extremity, by some  
ignorant clerk of the exchequer. But if this writ  
had been in any book whatever, it would have beeu  
illegal; all precedents are under the controul of  
the principles of law—lord Talbot says it is better  
to observe these than any precedents, though in the  
house of lords, the last resort of the subject, no  
acts of parliament can establish sucha writ, though  
it should be made in the very words of the petition  
it would be void. An act against the constitution  
is void, (vid. Viner.) but these prove no more,  
than what I before observed, that special writs may  
be granted on oath on probabie suspicion. The  
act of 7th and 8th of William III, thai the officers  
of plantations shall have the power, kc. is confined  
to this sense, that an officer stall shew probable  
ground, should take his oath of it, should do this  
before a magistrate, if he think proper, sbould is-  
sue aspecial , warrant to a constable to search the  
places. That of 6th Anne, can prove no more.”  
The lines underscored are interpolations (viz.)  
“until the trump of the arcl)-angel shall excite dif-  
ferent emotions in his soul.”— what is this but to  
have the curse of Canaan with a witness on us; to be  
  
the servants of servants, the most despieable of  
God’s creation?”
