te Mistress of his affections, of which I feel the whole force. In return I send you another most pathetic Sonnet.  
  
  
Veteris vestigia flammae.  
When the Sheep were in the fould,  
And the Ky at hame,  
And all the world  
To rest were gane.  
The waes of my heart,  
fell in showrs frae my EE,  
While my Gude man  
lay sound by me.  
Young Jamie loved me weel,  
and sought me for his bride,  
but saving one crown,  
He had nothing beside.  
To make that crown a pound,  
My Jamie gang’d to sea,  
and the crown and the pound  
were both for me.  
He had not been awa’  
a year and a day  
ere my father brake his arm,  
and the Cow was Staln away.  
My Mither she fell sick,  
and my Jamie at the sea,  
When auld Robin Gray  
came a courting to me.  
My heart it said Nay,  
I wishd for Jamie back,  
  
But the wind it blew hie,  
and the Ship was a wrack.  
The Ship was a wrack,  
why did not Jennie dee,  
o why was I spared  
to cry woe is me.  
My father could na work,  
My Mither could na spin,  
I toild day and night,  
But their bread I could na win.  
Auld Robin kept them baith,  
and with tears in his ee,  
said Jenny, for their sake,  
Oh would ye marry me.  
My father loved me weel,  
My Mither could na’ speek,  
But she look’d in my face,  
Till I thought I my heart would break.  
So I gave him my hand,  
tho my heart was at Sea,  
and auld Robin Gray  
Is gude man to me.  
I had na been his wife  
of weeks but only four,  
when sitting so mournfully  
out at the door;  
I saw my Jamie’s wraithe,  
for I did not think it he,  
till he said, I am come,  
Jenny, to marry thee.  
Oh sair did we greet,  
and mickle did we say,  
He took but one kiss,  
and we tore ourselves away.  
I wish I were deed,  
tho I am not like to dee,  
Oh why was I spared,  
to cry woe is me.  
I gang like a ghost,  
for I canna sit to spin,  
  
I may not think of Jamie,  
for that would be a sin.  
But I must do my best,  
a good wife to be,  
for Auld Robin Gray,  
is very kind to me.  
  
I have told you before that my heart is always set upon peace. In the present circumstances between the two Countries I can only think of one proposition to mediate. You may as easily imagine that th

I had na’ been his wife but weeks only four,  
  
When sitting so mournfully at my own door, She slowly lifts her head from her hand.  
  
I saw my Jamie’s ghost, for I could not think it he, Jamie enters, L. JEANNIE, in fright, motions  
him away.  
  
Till he said, “I’ve come home, love, to marry thee.”” They rush into each other&#x27;s arms.  
  
O, sair did we greet and mickle did we say, They bow their heads, then lift their heads as if  
conversing.  
  
We took na kiss at all, I bid him gang away, JEANNIE pushing him away, exit Jamie sadly, L.  
  
For I will do my best a good wife for to be, JEANNIE comes forward, extends her hands.  
  
For Auld Robin Gray is very kind to me. Sinks back into her seat, bowed with sorrow.
