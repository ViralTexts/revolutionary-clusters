In 1536, an Act of Parliament (28 Hen. VIII. c. 15) was passed  
which, after reciting that ‘‘ where traitors, pirates, thieves, robbers,  
murderers, and confederates upon the sea many times escaped  
unpunished, because the trial of their offences hath heretofore been  
ordered, judged, and determined before the Admiral, or his lieu-  
tenant or commissary, after the course of the Civil Laws, the  
nature whereof is that, before any judgment of death can be given  
against the offenders, either they must plainly confess their  
offences (which they will never do without torture or pains), or  
else their offences be so plainly and directly proved by witness  
indifferent, such as saw their offences committed, which cannot  
be gotten but by chance at few times, because such offenders  
commit their offences upon the sea, and at many times murder  
and kill such persons, being in the ship or boat where they commit  
their offences, which should witness against them in that behalf;  
and also such as should bear witness be commonly mariners and  
shipmen, which because of their often voyages and passages in  
the seas, depart without long tarrying and protraction of time,  
to the great costs and charges as well of the King’s Highness,  
as such as would pursue such offenders,” proceeded to enact that  
the above crimes, if thenceforth committed upon the sea, should  
be tried in such shires and places in the realm as should be limited  
by the King’s commission,
