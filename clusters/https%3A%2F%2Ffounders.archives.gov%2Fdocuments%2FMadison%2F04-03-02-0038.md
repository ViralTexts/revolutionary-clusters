The Republicans hold that a Lieuten­  
ant-Governor should be elected this fall,  
and their nominee, John T. Lynch, re­  
cently petitioned the Supreme Court  
for a writ of mandate requiring the Gov­  
ernor to include that office in his procla­  
mation.  
Tb lefs have now been filed by both  
sides to the controversy. In his brief  
Lynch quotes Section 8 of Article V. of  
the Constitution in support of his po­  
sition, which provides:  
&quot;Whenever any office shall, from any  
cause, become vacant, and no mode is  
provided by the Constitution and law  
for filling such vacancy, the Governor  
shall have power to fill such vacancy  
by granting a commission, which shall  
expire at the end of the next session of  
the Legislature, or at the next election  
by the people.&quot;  
On this section the Republican candi­  
date bases his argument that the va­  
cancy should be filled by the people at  
the coming election, and that it is the  
duty of the Governor to call an election  
for that office
