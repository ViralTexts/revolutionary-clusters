Dear Sir Monticello June 24. 13.  
This letter will be of Politics only. for altho’ I do not often permit myself to enter that field think on that subject, it sometimes obtrudes itself and suggests ideas which I am tempted to pursue. some of these relating to the business of finance, I will hazard to you, as being at the head of that committee, but intended for yourself individually, or such as you trust, but certainly not for a mixt Committee.  
It is a wise rule, and should be fundamental in a government disposed to cherish it’s credit, and at the same time to restrain the use of it within the limits of it’s faculties, ‘never to borrow a dollar without laying a tax in the same instant for paying the interest annually, and the principal within a given term: and to consider that tax as pledged to the creditors on the public faith.’ on such a pledge as this, sacredly observed, a government may always command on a reasonable interest, all the lendable money of their citizens, while the necessity of an equivalent tax is a salutary warning to them &amp; their constituents against oppressions, bankruptcy, &amp; it’s inevitable consequence Revolution. but the term of redemption must be moderate, and at any rate within the limits of their rightful powers. but what limits, it will be asked, does time prescribe to their powers? what is to hinder them from creating a perpetual debt? the laws of nature, I answer. the earth belongs to the living, not to the dead. the will &amp; the power of man expires with his life, by Nature’s law. some societies give it an artificial continuance, for the encouragement of industry, some refuse it, as our aboriginal neighbors, whom we call barbarians. the generations of men may be considered as bodies, or corporations. each generation has the usufruct of the earth during the period of it’s continuance. when it ceases to exist, the usufruct passes on to the succeeding generation, free and unincumbered, and so on successively from one generation to another for ever. we may consider each generation as a distinct nation with a right, by the will of it’s majority, to bind themselves, but none to bind the succeeding generation, more than the inhabitants of another country. or the case may be likened to the ordinary one of a tenant for life, who may hypothecate the land for his debts during the continuance of his usufruct; but at his death the reversioner (who is also for life only) recieves it exonerated from all burthen. the period of a generation, or the term of it’s life is determined by the laws of mortality, which, varying a little only in different climates, offer a general average, to be found by observation. I turn, for instance, to Buffon’s tables of 23,994. deaths, and the ages at which they happened, and I find that of the numbers of all ages living at one moment, half will be dead in 24. years, 8. months. but (leaving out minors, who  
				have not the power of self government) of the adults (of 21. years of age) living at one moment, a majority of whom act for the society, one half will be dead in 18. Y 8. M. at 19. years then  
				from  
				the date of a contract, the majority of the contractors is dead, and their contract with them.let this general theory be applied to a particular  
				case.  
				suppose the annual births of the state of N. york to be 23,994. the whole number of it’s inhabitants, according to Buffon, will be 617,703. of all ages. of these there would constantly be 269,286. minors. and 348,417. adults, of which last 174,209. will be a majority. suppose that majority, on the 1st day of the year 1794. had borrowed a sum of money equal to the feesimple value of the state, and to have consumed it in eating, drinking &amp; making merry in their day; or, if you please,  
			 in quarreling &amp; fighting with their unoffending neighbors. within 18. Y 8 M one half of the state adult citizens were dead. till then, being the majority, they might rightfully levy the interest of their debt annually on themselves &amp; their fellow revellers, or fellow champions. but at that period, say at this moment, a new majority is come into place, in their own right, and not under the rights, the conditions, or laws of their predecessors. are they bound to acknolege the debt, to consider the preceding generation as having had a right to eat up the whole soil of their country in the course of a life, to alienate it from them (for it would be an alienation to the creditors) and would they think themselves either legally or morally bound to give up their country, and emigrate to another for subsistence? every one will say No: and that the soil is the gift of God to the living, as much as it had been to the deceased generation: and that the laws of Nature impose no obligation on them to pay this debt. and altho’, like some other natural rights, this has not yet entered into any Declaration of rights, it is no less a law, and ought to be acted on by honest governments. it is at the same time a salutary curb on the spirit of war and indebtment which, since the modern theory of the perpetuation of debt, has drenched the earth with blood, and crushed it’s inhabitants under burthens ever accumulating. had this principle been declared in the British bill of rights, England would have been placed under the happy disability of waging eternal war, and of contracting her thousand millions of public debt.in seeking then for an ultimate term for the redemption of our debts, let us rally to this principle, and provide for their paiment within the term of 19. years, at the farthest.our government has not, as yet, begun to act on the rule of loans &amp; taxation going hand in hand. had any loan taken place in my time, I should have strongly urged a redeeming tax. for the loan which has been made since the last session of Congress, we should now set the example of appropriating some particular tax, sufficient to pay the interest annually and the principal within a  
			 fixed term, less than 19. years. and I hope yourself and your committee will render the immortal service of introducing this practice. not that it is expected that Congress should formally  
			 declare  
			 such a principle. they wisely enough avoid deciding on abstract questions. but they may be induced to keep themselves within it’s limits.  
I am sorry to see our loans begin at so exorbitant an interest. and yet, even at that, you will soon be at the bottom of the loan-bag. we are an Agricultural nation. such an one employs it’s sparings in the purchase or improvement of land or stocks. the lendable money among them is chiefly that of orphans &amp; wards in the hands of executors &amp; guardians, &amp; that of which the farmer lays by till he has enough for the purchase in view. in such a nation there is one, and one only, resource for loans, sufficient to carry them thro’ the expence of a war: and that will always be sufficient, and in the power of an honest government, punctual in the preservation of it’s faith. the fund I mean is, the mass of circulating coin. every one knows that, altho’ not literally, it is nearly true that every paper dollar emitted banishes a silver one from the circulation. a nation therefore making it’s purchases and paiments with bills fitted for circulation thrusts an equal sum of coin out of circulation. this is equivalent to borrowing that sum, and yet the vendor recieving paiment in a medium equivalent to as effectual as coin for his purchases or paiments, has no claim to interest. and so the nation may continue to issue it’s bills as far as their wants require, and the limits of the circulation will admit. those limits are understood to extend with us at present to 200. millions of Dollars, a greater sum than would be necessary for any war. but this, the only resource which the government could command with certainty the states have unfortunately fooled away, nay corruptly alienated to swindlers and shavers under the cover of private banks. say too, as an additional evil that the disposable funds of individuals, to this great amount, have thus been withdrawn from improvement, and useful enterprize, and employed in the useless, usurious, and demoralizing practices of bank directors &amp; their accomplices.in the war of 55. our state availed itself of this fund by issuing a paper money bottomed on a specific tax for it’s redemption, and, to ensure it’s credit, bearing an interest of 5. percent. within a very  
			 short time not a bill of this emission was to be found in circulation. it was locked up in the chests of executors, guardians, widows, farmers Etc. we then issued bills, bottomed on a redeeming tax, but bearing no interest. these were readily recieved, &amp; never depreciated a single farthing. in the revolutionary war the old Congress and the states issued bills without interest, and without tax. they occupied the channels of circulation very freely, till those  
			 channels were overflowed by an excess beyond all the calls of circulation.but altho we have so improvidently suffered the field of circulating medium to be filched from us by private individuals, yet I think we may recover it in part, and even in the whole if the states will cooperate with us. if treasury bills are emitted on a tax appropriated for their redemption in 15 years and (to ensure preference in the first moments of competition) bearing an interest of 6. per cent. there is no one who would not take them in preference to the bank paper now afloat, on a principle of patriotism as well as interest: and they would be withdrawn from circulation into private hoards to a considerable amount. their credit once established, others might be emitted, bottomed also on a tax, but not bearing interest: and if ever their credit faultered, open public loans, on which these bills alone should be recieved as specie. these, operating as a sinking fund, would reduce the quantity in circulation, so as to maintain that in an equilibrium with specie.it is not easy to estimate the obstacles which, in the beginning, we should be encounter in ousting the banks from their possession of the circulation: but a steady &amp; judicious alternation of emissions &amp; loans, would reduce them in time.but while this is going on, another measure should be pressed to recover ultimately our right to the circulation. the states should be applied to to transfer the right of issuing circulating paper to Congress exclusively, in perpetuum, if possible, but during the war at least, with a saving of charter rights. I believe that every state West &amp; South of Connecticut river, except Delaware, would immediately do it: and the others would follow in time. Congress would of course begin by obliging unchartered banks to wind up their affairs within a short time, and  
			 the others as  
			 their charters expired, forbidding the subsequent alienat circulation of their paper. this they would supply with their own, bottomed, every emission, on an adequate tax, &amp; bearing, or not bearing interest as the state of the public pulse should indicate. even in the non-complying states, these bills would make their way, and supplant the unfunded paper of their banks, by their solidity, by the universality of their currency, and by their receivability at the for customs, and taxes. it would be in their power too to curtail those banks to the amount of their actual specie, by gathering up their paper, and running it constantly on them. the national paper might thus take place even in the non-complying states. in this way I am not without a hope that this great, this sole resource for loans in an agricultural country, might yet be recovered for the use of the nation during war: and, if obtained in perpetuum, it would always be sufficient to carry us thro’ any war; provided that in the interval between war &amp; war, all the outstanding paper should be called in, coin be permitted to flow in again and to hold the field of circulation until another war should require it’s yielding place again to the National medium.  
But it will be asked, are we to have no banks? are merchants &amp; others to be deprived of the resource of short accomodations found so convenient? I answer, let us have banks: but let them be such as alon are alone to be found in any country on earth; except Gr. Britain. there is not a bank of discount on the continent of Europe, (at least there was not one when I was there) which offers any thing but cash in exchange for discounted bills. no one has a right to the trade of a money lender who but he who has the money to lend. let those then among us, who have a monied capital, &amp; who prefer employing it in loans rather than otherwise, set up banks, and give cash, or national bills for the notes they discount. perhaps, to encourage them, a larger interest than is legal in other cases might be allowed them, on the condition of their lending for short periods only. it is from Gr. Britain we copy the idea of giving paper in exchange for discounted bills: and while we have derived from that country some good principles of government &amp; legislation; we unfortunately run into the most servile imitation of all her practices, ruinous as they prove to her, and with the gulph yawning before us into which those very practices are precipitating her. the unlimited emission of bank paper has banished all her specie, and is now, by a depreciation acknoleged by her own statesmen, hurrying her rapidly to bankruptcy, as it did France, as it did us, and will do us again, and every country permitting paper to be circulated, other than that by public authority, rigorously limited to the just measure for  
			 circulation. private  
			 fortunes, in the present state of our circulation are at the mercy of those self-created money lenders, and are prostrated by the floods of nominal money with which their avarice deluges us. he who lent his money to the public or to an individual, before the institution of the United-States-bank, 20 years ago, when wheat was well sold at a dollar the bushel, and recieves now his nominal sum when it sells at two dollars is cheated of half his fortune: and by whom? by the banks which since that have thrown into circulation 10. Dollars of their nominal money where was one at that time.  
Reflect, if you please, on these things, ideas, and use them or not as they appear to merit. they comfort me in the belief that they

of competition) bparing interest of six per centum,  
there is no one who would not take them in preference  
to the bank paper now afloat, on a principle of patriotism  
as well as interest; and they would be withdrawn  
from circulation into private hoards, to a considerable  
amount. Their credit once established, others might be  
emitted, bottomed also on a tax. but not bearing interest;  
and it ever their credit faltered, open public loans,  
on which these bills alone should be received as specie.  
These, operating as a sinking fund, would reduce the  
quantity in circulation,so as lu maintain that equilibrium  
with specie.

&quot;We are an agricultural nation. Such an oue  
employs its sparings in the purchase or improve­  
ment of land or stocks. The lendable money  
among them is chiefly that of orphans and wards  
in the hands of executors and guardians, and that  
which the farmer lays by till he has enough for  
the purchase in view. In such a nation there is  
one and one only resource for loans, sufsicient to  
carry them through the expense of a war; and  
that will always be sufficient, and in the power of  
an honest government, punctual in the preserva­  
tion of its faith. The fund I mean, is the mass  
of circulaling coin. Every one knows, that, al­  
though not literally, it is nearly true, that every  
paper dollar emitted banishes a silver one from  
the circulation. A nation, therefore, making its  
purchases and payments with bills fitted for cir­  
culation, thrusts an equal sum of coin out of cir­  
culation. This is equivalent to borrowing that  
  
sum, and yet the vendor, receiving payment in a  
medium as effectual as coin for his purchases or  
payments, has no claim to interest. And so the  
  
nation may continue to issue its hills as fat as its  
  
wants require, and the limits of the circulation will  
admit. I hose limits are understood to extend  
  
with us, at present, to two hundred millions of  
  
lollars, a greater sum than would be necessary  
  
for any war. But this, the only resource which  
  
he Government could command with certainty,  
  
the States have unfortunately fooled away, nay  
  
corruptly altenated to swindlers and shavers, un  
  
der the cover of private banks. Say, too, as an  
  
additional evil, that the disposable funds of indi  
  
viduals, to this great amount, have thus been with  
  
drawn from improvement and useful enterprise,  
  
and employed in the useless, usurious, and demor-  
  
alizing practices of bank directors and their ac  
complices.

&quot;We may consider each generation as a distinct

bind themselves, but none to bind the succeeding  
generation, more than the inhabitants of another  
country. Or the case may be likened to the or­

from all burthen. The period of a generation, or  
the term of its life, is determined by the laws of  
mortality, which, varying a little only in different

&quot;We are an agricultural nation. Such an oue  
employs its sparings in the purchase or improve  
ment of land or stocks. The lendable mons  
among them is chiefly that of orphans and ward  
in the hands of executors and guardians, and that  
which the farmer lays by till he has enough for  
the purchase in view. In such a nation there is  
one and one only resource for loans, sufficient to  
carry them through the expense of a war; and  
that will always be sufficient, and in the power of  
an honest government, punctual in the preserva  
tion of its faith. The fund I mean, is the mass  
of circulating coin. Every one knows, that, a  
though not literally, it is nearly true, that ever  
paper dollar emitted banishes a silver one from  
the circulation. A nation, therefore, making its  
purchases and payments with bills fitted for cir  
culation, thrusts an equal sum of coin out of cir  
culation. This is equivalent to borrowing that  
sum, and yet the vendor, receiving payment in a  
medium as effectual as coin for his purchases or  
payments, has no claim to interest. And so the  
nation may continue to issue its bills as far as its  
wants require, and the limits of the circulation will  
admit. Those limits are understood to extend  
with us, at present, to two hundred millions of  
dollars, a greater sum than would be necessary  
for any war. But this, the only resource which  
the Government could command with certainty,  
the States have unfortunately fooled away, nay  
corruptly alienated to swindlers and shavers, un­  
der the cover of private banks. Say, too, as an  
additional evil, that the disposable funds of indi  
viduals, to this great amount, have thus been with-  
drawn from improvement and useful enterprise,  
and employed in the useless, usurious, and demor-  
alizing practices of bank directors and  
complices

of 24th of June 1813 to John W. Eppes.  
&quot;We may consider each generation as a distinct  
nation, with a right, by the will of its majority, to  
bind themselves, but none to bind the succeeding  
generation, more than the inhabitants of another  
country. Or the case may be likened to the or­  
dinary one of a tenant for life, who may hypothe­  
cate the land for his debts, during the continuance  
of his usufruct; but at his death, the reversioner  
(who is also for life only) receives it exonerated  
from all burthon. The period of a generation, or  
the term of its life, is determined by the laws of  
mortality, which, varying a little only in different  
climates, offer a general average, to be found by  
observation. I turn, for instance, to Buffon&#x27;s ta­  
bles, of twenty-three thousand nine hundred and  
  
ninety four deaths, and the age  
hapnened and I od that of the  
  
at which they  
mumbers of all  
pte t  
ages living at one moment, hall will be dead in  
twenty-four years and eight months. But (leav  
ing out minors, who have not the power of sell­  
governmend of the adults (of twenty-one years  
of age) living at one moment, a majority of whom  
act for the society, ene half will be dead in eigh­  
teen years and eight months. At nineteen year  
then from the date of a contract, the majority of  
the contractors are dead, and their contract with  
them. Let this general theory be applied to  
particular case. Suppose the annual births of the  
State of New York to be twenty-three thousand  
nine hundred and ninety-four: the whole number  
of its inhabitants, according to Bufson, will be six  
hundred and seventeen thousand seven bundred  
and three, of all ages. Of these there would con­  
stantly be two hundred and sixty-nine thousand  
two hundred and eighty-six minors, and three  
hundred and forty-eight thousand four bundred  
and seventeen adults, of which last, one hundred  
and seventy-four thousand two hundred and nine  
will be a majority. Suppose that majority, on the  
first day of the year 1794, had borrowed a sum  
f money equal to the fee simple value of the  
State, and to have consumed it in eating drinking  
and making merry in their day; or, it you please  
in quarrelling and fighting with then unoffending  
neighbors. Within eighteen years and eight  
months, one half of the adult citizens were dead.  
Iill then, being the majority, they might rightfully  
evy the interest of their debt annually on them-  
selves and their fellow-revellers, or fellow-cham  
pions. But at that period, say at this moment, a  
new majority have come into place, in their own  
right, and not under the rights, the conditions, or  
laws of their predecessors. Are they bound to  
acknowledge the debl, to consider the preceding  
generation as having had a right to eat up the  
whole soil of their country in the course of a life,  
to alienate it from them (for it would be an alien-  
ation to the creditors,) and would they think them  
selves either legally or morally bound to give up  
their country, and emigrate to another for subsis  
tence? Every one will say no; that the soll is the  
gift of God to the living, as much as it had been  
to the deceased generation, and that the laws of  
nature impose no obligation on them to pay this  
debt. And although, like some other natural rights  
this has not yet entered into any declaration of  
rights, it is no less a law, and ought to be acted  
on by honest governments.

the following language:  
&quot; A nation, therefore, making it&#x27; purchases and  
payments with bills thud for circulation, thrusts an  
ritual sum of coin out ofcirculation. &#x27;l&#x27;his is equivalent  
to borrowing that sum, and yet the vender receiving  
payments in a medium as effectual as coin for  
his purchases or payments, ha* no claim to interest.  
And so the nation may continue to issue its bills as  
far as its wants require, and the limits of the circulation  
will admit. t hose limits are understood to extend  
with us, at presen&#x27;, to two hundred millions of  
dollars, a greater sum than would lie necessary for  
any war. But this, the only resource which the Go- I  
vernment could command with certainty, the States  
have unfortunately fooled away, nay corruptly alienated  
to swindlers and shaver-, under the cover of  
private hanks. Say, t o, as an additional evil, that |  
the dnqiosable funds of individuals, to tins great  
amount, have thus been withdrawn from improvement  
and useful enterprise, and employed in the  
useless, usurious, and demoralising practices of bunk  
directors and their accomplices In the war of 1755,  
our Slate availed itself of this fund by issuing a paper  
money, bottomed on a specific tax for its redemption,  
and, to insure its credit, bearing an inteiest of five per  
cent. Within n very sh irt time, not a bill ofihis  
emission was to be found m circulation. It was locked  
up in the chests of executors, guardians, widows,  
farmers, &amp;.C. We then issued hills, bottomed on a  
^il^minitov lint henrimr no interest These weic  
  
readily received, ami never depreciated a single faithing  
In the Revolutionary war, the old Congress  
and the States issued bills without interest, and without  
(at. They occupied the channels of circulation  
very freely, tiil those channels were overflowed by  
nn excess beyond all the calls of circulation. But although  
we have so improvident ly suffered the field of  
circulating medium to t&gt;e filched from us by private individuals,  
yet I think we may recover it in part, and  
aven in the whole, it the Stales will co-oper tie with  
us, Ii treasury bills are emitted on a lax appropriated  
for their redemption in fifteen years, ami (to insure  
preference in the first moments of competition)  
hearing an interest of six per cent, there is no one  
who would not take them in picferrnce to the bank  
paper now afloat, on a principle of patriotism as w ell  
as interest and they would be withdrawn Iro n circulation  
into private hoards to a considerable amour t.  
Their credit once established, others might be egiitted,  
bottomed also on a tax, but not trearing interest  
and if ever their credit faultered, open public loans,  
on which ihese bills uluiir should be received as #|*icie.  
These, operating is a sink ng fund, would reduce  
the quantity in circulation, so as to maintain  
that in an equilibrium with specie. It is not i asy to  
estima&#x27;e the obstacles which, in (he beginning,  
we should encounter in ousting the binks from  
their possession of the circulation, but a steady and  
judicoua alternation of emissions and loans, would reduce  
them in time But while this is going on,  
another&#x27;measure should lie pressed, to recover ultimately  
our right to the circulation. The States  
should be applied to, to transfer the right of issu.irg  
circulating paper to Congress exclusively, in jtcrpe(uum,  
if possible, but duiing the war at least, with a  
saving o*&#x27; charter rights. I believe that every State  
west and south of Connecticut river, except Delaware.  
would -immediately do it ; and the others would  
follow in time. Congress would, of course, begin by  
obliging unchartered banks to wind up their affairs  
within a short time, and the other# as their charters  
expired, forbidding the subsequent cuculation of their  
  
paper. Thia they would supply with iheir i&gt;wn, bottomed,  
every emission, on ani adequate tax, and bearing  
or not I tearing inteiest, ai (lie state of the puttlic  
pulse should indicate. I&#x27;.vcn in the nun complying  
states, these, bills would make their way, and sup&quot;  
plant the unfunded paper of their banks, by their solidity,  
bv the universality of their currency, and by  
their receivability fur customs and taxes. It would be  
in their power, too, to curtail tlio-c batiks to the  
amount of their aetud specie, by gathering up their  
paper, ami running it constantly on them, &#x27;l&#x27;he national  
paper might thus take place even in the noncomplying  
States. In this way, 1 am not without a  
hope, that this great, the sole resource for loans in an  
agricultural country, might vet be recovered for the  
use of the nation during war : and, if obtained in  
perpetuum, it would always he sufficient to carry us  
through any war ; provided, that in the interval between  
war and war, all the outstanding paper should  
he called in, coin he permilledto flow in again, and  
lo hold the field of circulation until another war  
should require its yielding place again to the national

the Government of the United States  
was under the necessity of borrowing  
large sums of money, and when its  
credit was seriously impaired, Mr. Jef­  
ferson, in a letter to Mr. Eppes, chair­  
man of the committee of ways and  
means of the House of Representa­  
tives. recommended the following rule  
asa guide for all governments which  
were disposed to cherish their credit:  
“ It is a wise rule and should be fun­  
damental in a government disposed to  
cherish its credit, and at the same time  
to restrain the use of it within the lim­  
its of its facilities, never to borrow a  
dollar without laying a tax in the same  
instant for paying the interest annually  
and the principal within a given time;  
and to consider that tax a* pledged to  
the creditors on the public faith. On  
such a pledge as this, sacredly observed  
a government may always command,  
on a reasonable interest, all the lendable  
money of their citizens, while the ne­  
cessity of an equivalent tax is a sal­  
utary warning of them and their con­  
stituents against oppressions, bankrupt­  
icy, and its inevitable consequences,  
revolution.”

to the effectthat there might have been minors, wanting only a few  
days of legal age, who might thus be bound for nearly nineteen  
years to a system which they might disapprove of, and to which  
they ought not to be subjected per force when of age to assert

“It is a wise rule, and should be fundamental in a government disposed  
to cherish its credit, and at the same time to restrain the use of it within the  
limits of its faculties, never to borrow a dollar without laying a tax, in the  
same instant, for paying the interest annually, and the principal within a  
given term: and to consider that tax as pledged to the creditors on the public  
faith. On such a pledge as this, sacredly observed, a government may  
always command, on a reasonable interest, all the lendable money of its  
citizens; whilst the necessity of an equivalent tax is a salutary warning to  
them and to their constituents against oppression, bankruptcy, and its inevi-  
table consequence—revolution! But the term of redemption must be mod-  
erate; and, at any rate, within the limit of their rightful powers. But what  
limits, it will be asked, does this prescribe to their powers? What is to  
hinder them from creating a perpetual debt? I answer the laws of nature.  
  
  
  
144 . National Debts.  
  
The earth belongs to the living, not to the dead. The will and power of  
man expire with his life by nature’s law. Some societies give it an artificial  
continuance, for the encouragement of industry. Some refuse it: as our  
aboriginal neighbors whom we call barbarians. The generations of men  
may be considered as bodies or corporations. Each generation has the usu-  
Jruct of the earth during the period of its continuance. When it ceases to  
exist, that usufruct passes on to the succeeding generation, free and unin-  
cumbergd ; and so on, to and from one generation to another, for ever. We  
may consider each generation as a distinct nation, with @ right by the will  
-of a majority, to bind themselves ; but none to bind the succeeding generation,  
more than the inhabitants of another country. Or the case may be likened  
to the ordinary one of a tenant for life, who may hypothecate the land for  
his debts, during the continuance of his usufruct; but at his death the re-  
versioner (who Is for life only) receives it exonerated from all burthens. The  
period of a generation, or its term of life, is determined by the laws of mor-  
tality, which, varying a little only in different climates, offer a general aver-  
to be found by observation. I turn, for instance, to Buffon’s tables of  
23,994 deaths, and the ages at which they happened; and I find that, of the  
numbers of all ages living at one moment, half will be dead in twenty-four  
years and eight months. But, leaving out the minors who have not the power  
of self-government, of the adults [of age] living at one moment, a majority  
of whom act for society, one half will be dead in eighteen years and eight  
months. At nineteen years then, from the date of a contract, the majority of  
the contractors are dead, and their contract with them. Let this general  
theory be applied to a particular case. Suppose the annual [male ?] births  
of the state of New York to be 23,994, the number of its [male ?] inhabitants,  
according to Buffon, will be 617,703 of all ages. Of these, there would con-  
stantly be 269,286 minors, and 348,417 adults ; of which last 174,209 will be  
a majority. Suppose that majority, on the first day of June, 1794, had bor-  
rowed a sum of money equal to the fee-simple of the state, and to have  
consumed it in eating and drinking and making merry in their day ; or, if  
ou please, in quarrellivg and fighting with their unoffending neighbors.  
ithin eighteen — and eight months, one half of the adult citizens are  
dead. Till then, being the majority, they might rightfully levy the interest  
of their debt annually on themselves and their fellow-revellers, or fellow-  
champions. But, at that period, say at this moment, a new majority have  
come into place, in their own right, and not under the rights, the conditions,  
or the laws of their predecessors. Are they bound to consider the debt; to  
consider the preceding generation as having had a right to eat up the whole  
of the soil of their country in the course of a life; to alienate it from them  
(for it would be an alienation to the creditors ;) and would they think them-  
selves either legally or morally bound to give up their country and to emi-  
grate to another for subsistence? Every one will say ‘No!’ The soil is the  
gift of God to the living as much as it had been to the deceased generation ;  
and the law of nature imposes no obligation on them to pay this debt. And,  
although, like some other natural rights, this has not yet entered into any  
‘Declaration of Rights,’ it is no less a law; and ought to be acted upon by  
all honest governments. It is, at the same time, a salutary curb on the spirit  
of war and indebtment; which, since the modern theory of the perpetra-  
tion of debt, has drenched the earth with blood and crushed its inhabitants  
under burthens ever accumulating. Had this principle been declared in the  
British ‘Bill of Rights,’ England would have been placed under the: happy  
disability of waging eternal war, and of contracting her thousand millions of  
public debt!”? (Jefferson’s Correspondence, vol. iv. p. 202. Letter to Joh

Mr. Jetfersou’s theory in relation to National

for his debts, during the continuance of his usufruct } but at  
his death the reversioner (who is for life only) receives it ex­  
onerated from all burdens. The period of a generation, or  
its term of life, is determined by the Wws of mortality, which,  
varying a Intle only in different climates, offer a general ave­  
rage to bo found by observation. I turn, for instance, to Buf­

this general theory be applied to a particular case. Suppose

Bulfon, will be fi 17,703 of all ages. Of these, theie would  
constantly be 269,280 minors, and 348,417 adults; of which  
last 174,209 will be a majority. Suppose that majority, on

In 1813, when the &#x27; Government of the United  
States was under the necessity of borrowing large  
sums of money, and when its credit was seriously  
impaired, Mr. Jefferson, in a letter to Mr. Eppes,.  
chairman ot the committee of ways and means of  
the House of Representatives, recommended the  
,following rule as a guide forall governments which  
were disposed to cherish their credit:  
  
“ It is a wise rule and should be fundamental in

uternation of emissions and loans would reduce them in  
time. But while this is going on, another measure should  
be pressed, to recover ultimately our right to the circula  
  
tion. The States should be applied to, to transter the right  
of issuing circulating paper to Congress exclusively, in per  
  
petuum, if possible, but during the war at least, witha sav  
  
ing of charter rights. I believe that every State west and  
south of Connecticut riv except Delaware, would imme  
diately doit; and the others would follow in time. Con  
  
gress would, of course, begin by obliging unchartered banks  
  
to wind up their affairs withiv a short time, and the others  
as their charters expired, forbidding the subsequent circu  
lation of their paper. This they would supply with their  
own, bottomed, every emission, on an adequate tax, and  
bearing or not bearing interest, as the state of the public  
pulse should indicat Even in the non-compiying States  
these bills would make their way, and supplant the un  
funded paper of their banks, by their solidity, by the uni  
versality of their currency, and by their reeeivability for  
  
customs and taxes. It w in their power, too,  
curtail those banks to the amount of their actual specie,  
by gathering up their paper, and running it constantly on  
them. The national paper might thus take place even in  
the non-complying States. [nh this way, | am not with  
out a hope that this great, this sole resource for loans in an  
agricultural country, might yet be recovered for the use of  
the nation during war; and, if obtained ta perpetuum, it  
would always be sufficient to carry us through any war;  
provided, that in the interval between war and war, ail the  
outstanding paper should be called in, coin be permitted  
to flow in again, and to hold the field of cirewlation until  
another war should require its yielding place again to the  
national medium

fundamental in a government disposed to cherish its credit, and, at the same  
time, to restrain the use of it within the limits of its facilities, never to bor.  
row a dollar without laying a tax in the same instant, for paying the interest  
annually and the principal within a given term; and to consider that tax  
as pledged to the creditors on the public faith. On such a pledge as this,  
sacredly observed, a government may always command, on a reasonable  
-interest, all the lendable money of its citizens; whilst the necessity of an  
equivalent tax is a salutary warning to them and their constituents  
against oppression, bankruptcy, and its inevitable consequence, revolution.”

theory of conducting the finances, in time of  
war, was very similar to that now entertained  
and practiced upon by the present Secretary of  
the Treasury, with the difference that Mr.  
Chase&#x27;s ideas are rather more economical. Mr.  
Jefferson writes:  
&quot;A nation making its purchases and pay­  
ments with bills fitted for circulation thrusts  
an equal sum of coin out of circulation. This  
is equivalent to borrowing the sum, and yet  
the vender, receiving payments in medium as  
effectual as coin for his purchases or a payments,  
has no claim to interest. And so the nation  
may continue to issue its bills as far as its  
wants may require, and the limits of the cir­  
culation will admit.  
&quot;Those limits are understood to extend with  
us, at present, to two hundred millions of dol­  
lars--a greater sum than would be necersary for  
any war. But this, the only resource which  
the Government could command with certain­  
ty, the States have unfortunately fooled away,  
nay, corruptly alienated to swindlers and  
shavers, under the cover of private banks.  
Say, too, as an additional evil, that the  
disposable funds of individuals, to this great  
amount have thus been withdrawn from im­  
provement and useful enterprise, and em­  
ployed in the useless, usurious, and demoraliz­

gonerat on or its term of life is determined by he laws  
of mortality, which, varying a little only ihdifferent  
climates, offer a general average, to b found  
by observation. I turn, for instance, to Ruffons tables of  
deaths and the ages at which they hapened, and  
I find that of the numbers of all ages fyng at one  
moment half will be dead in twenty foir years and  
eight months. But leaving out the mifors, who have  
not the power of self-government, of thenidlts tof agel  
living at one moment, a majority of whom act for  
society, one half will be dead in eigleen years and  
eight months. At nineteen years, then from the date  
of a contract the majority of the confactors are dead,  
and their contract with them. Let thif general theory  
be applied to a particilar case. Supose the annual  
(male) births of the State of New Yofk to be 28,994,  
the numbar of its male) inhabitants, adording to Busion,  
will he o1710d of all ases oof thess here would cone  
be 269,286 minors and 318,41f adults, of which  
last 174,000 will be a malority. Suppse that mafority  
on the first day of June, 1704, had borrowed a  
sum of money equal to the il simple of the  
State, and to have consumed A in eating and  
drinking and making merry in their day, or, if  
you please, in quarrelling and fighthg with their unof:  
fending neighbors. Within ighiefn years and eight  
months one-half of the adult cititens are dead. Till  
then, being the malority, they might rightfully levy the  
interest of their debt annually on thenselves and their  
foipw terlem of fellow thinrptons s hit at that pe  
say at this moment--a now majority have come  
into place in their own right, and not under the rights,  
the conditions or the laws of sheir predecessors. Are  
they bound to consider the debseto conasider the preed  
generation as having had a right to eat up the whole  
of the soll of taeir country in the course of a life ito  
altenate it from Hem tfor it would be an alienation to  
the creditorsh, and would they think themselves  
either legall? g morally bound to give up  
their country and to emigrate to gnother for  
mbsistence? Evely one will af ho. The sollis the  
gift of Ood to the living as much as it had boen to the  
depoased generation, and the law of nature imposes no  
obligstion on them to pay this debt. And although, like

It is a wise rule, and should be fundamental in a government disposed  
to cherish its credit and at the same time to restrain the use of it within  
the limits of its faculties, never to borrow a dollar without laying a tax  
in the same instant for paying the interest annually and the principal  
within a given term, and to consider that tax as pledged to the creditors  
on the public faith. On such a pledge as this, sacredly observed, a gov-  
ernment may always command, on a reasonable interest, all the lendable  
money of its citizens, while the necessity of an equivalent tax is a salutary  
  
warning to them and to their constituents against oppression, bankruptcy,  
and its inevitable consequence—revolution. But the term of redemption  
must be moderate, and, at any rate, within the limit of their rightful  
powers. But what limits, it will be asked, does this prescribe to their  
powers? What is to hinder them from creating a perpetual debt? I an-  
swer, the laws of nature. The earth belongs to the living, not to the  
dead. The will and power of man expire with his life by ‘nature&#x27;s law.  
Some societies give it an artificial continuance, for the encouragement of  
industry. Some refuse it, as our aboriginal neighbors, whom we call bar-  
barians.  
  
The generations of men may be considered as bodies or corporations.  
Each generation has the usufruct of the earth during the period of its  
continuance. When it ceases to exist, that wsufruct passes on to the suc-  
ceeding generation free and unencumbered, and so on to and from one  
generation to another forever. We may consider each generation as a  
distinet nation, with a right by the will of a majority to bind themselves,  
but none to bind the succeeding generations, more than the inhabitants  
of another country. Or the case may be likened to the ordinary one of  
a tenant for life, who may hypothecate the land for his debts during the  
continuance of his wsufruct, but at his death the reversioner (who is for  
life only) receives it exonerated from all burdens, The period of a gen-  
eration, or its term of life, is determined by the laws of mortality, which,  
varying a little only in different climates, offer a general average to be  
found by observation. I turn, for instance, to Burron’s tables of 23,994  
deaths and the ages at which they happened, and I find that, of the num-  
bers of all ages living at one moment, half will be dead in twenty-four  
years and eight months.  
  
But leaving out the minors who have not the power of self- -govern-  
ment, of the adults (of age) living at one moment, a majority of whom  
act for society, one-half will be dead in eighteen years and eight months.  
At nineteen years, then, from the date of a contract the majority of the  
contractors are dead, and their contract with them. Let this general  
theory be applied to a particular case, Suppose the annual (male) births  
of the State of New York to be 23,994, the number of its (male) inhabi-  
tants, according to Burroy, will be 617, 703 of all ages. f these there  
would constantly be 269,286 minors and 318,417 adults, of which last  
  
  
  
174 A Clearing House in Cincinnati. [September,  
  
174,209 will be a majority. Suppose that majority on the first day of  
June, 1794, had borrowed a sum of money equal to the fee simple of the  
State, and to have consumed it in eating and drinking and making merry  
in their day, or, if you please, in quarreling and ‘fighting with their  
unoffending “neighbors, Within eighteen years and eight months, one-  
halt of the adult citizens are dead. Till then, being the majority, they  
might rightfully levy the interest of their debt annually on themselves  
and their fellow-revellers or fellow- -champions.  
  
But at that period—say at this —- new majority have come  
into place in their own right, and not under the rights, the conditions, or  
the laws of their predecessors. Are they bound to consider the debt—  
to consider the preceding generation as having had a right to eat up the  
whole of the soil of their country in the course of a life, to alienate it from  
them (for it would be an alienation to the creditors), and would they  
think themselves either legally or morally bound to give up their country  
and to emigrate to another for subsistence? Every one will say no. The  
soil is the gift of God to the living as much as it had been to the de-  
ceased generation, and the law of nature imposes no obligation on them  
to pay this debt. And although, like some other natural rights, this has  
not yet entered into any declaration of rights, it is no less a law and ought  
to be acted upon by all honest governments. It is at the same time a  
salutary curb on the spirit of war and indebtment, which, since the mod-  
ern theory of the perpetuation of debt, has drenched the earth with  
blood and crushed its inhabitants under burdens ever accumulating. Had  
this principle been declared in the British Bill of Rights, England would  
have been placed under the happy disability of waging eternal war and  
of contracting her thousand millions of public debt.

rowing that sum, and yet the lender, re­  
ceiving payment in a medium as effec­  
tual as coin for his purchases and pay­

forced loan, in the form of circulating

from Monticello to Mr. Eppes, June 24,

ecs teyond all the calls of circulation. But al­  
though we have so improvidently suffetcd the  
field of circulating medium to be&quot; filched from  
us by private indiviluals, yet I think we may  
recover it in piart, and even in the waule, if  
the States wdl co-operate with us.  
&quot;If Treasury bills ar emitted ou a tax ap­  
propriated for their redemption ia fit&#x27;teen  
years, and (t j injure preference iu the first  
moments of competition) beariug an interest  
of t percent., there is no one who would not  
take them in preference u the bank paper now  
afloat, on a principle of patriotism as well as  
interest; and they woul J. be w;;h,.riwn from  
circulation into private hoards to a consider  
able amount. Their credit once established,  
others might be omitted, botUineU also on a  
tax, but not bearing interest; and if ever  
their credit falur i. open public loaus. on  
which these biils afjnj ftaould be received as  
sp.cie. These, operating as a sinking fund,  
would reXluc? the quantity in circulation, so  
as to maintain that in an equilibrium with  
specie. It is not easy to estimate the obsta­  
cles which, in the beginning, we sheu&#x27;d en­  
counter in ousting ihe banks from their pos­  
session of the circulation ; bui a steady and

woiiid reduce them in time. But wh&#x27;ie this is

to this declaration of his. &quot;Bank paper  
must be suppressed and the circulating

ment, where it belongs. Jt is the only fund  
on which they can rely for loans ; it is the  
only recourse which can never fail them,  
and it is aa abundant one for every pur­  
pose.&quot; But I give opinions at length on  
this subject, (Jetferson s Works, volume 4,  
pages 40 and 41 :)  
And so the nation may continue to issue  
its bills as far as its wants require and the  
limits of the circulation will admit. Those  
limits are understood to extend with us at  
present to two hundred millions of dollars,  
a greater sum than would be necessary for

the Government could command with cer­

cific tax for its redemption, and to insure  
its credit, bearing an interest of 5 per cent.  
Within a very short time not a bill of this  
emission was to be found in circulation.  
It was locked up in the chests of executors,  
guardians,&#x27; widows, farmers, &amp;c. We then  
issued bills bottomed on a redeeming tax,  
  
but bearins no interest. These were readilv  
  
received and never depreciated a single  
  
farthing. In the revolutionary war the old  
Congress and the Slates issued bills without  
interest and without tax. They occupied  
the channels of circulation very freely till  
tbose channels were overflowed by an excess  
beyond all the calls of circulation. But  
although we have so improvidently suffered  
  
the held of circulating medium to be niched  
from us by private individual.-, yet I think  
we may recover it in part, and even in the  
whole, if the States will co-operate with  
us.  
If Treasury bills are emitted on a tax  
appropriated for their redemption in fifteen  
years, and (to insure preference in the first  
moments of competition) bearing an inter  
  
est ot b per cent., there is no one wdio would  
  
not take them in preference to the bank  
  
paper now afloat, on a principle of patriot  
  
ism as well as interest; and they would be  
  
withdrawn from circulation into privat  
  
hoards to a considerable amount. Their  
  
credit once established, others might be  
omitted, bottomed also on a tax, but not  
  
bearing interest; aud if ever their credit  
faltered, open public loans, on which these  
  
bills alone should be received as specie.  
These, operating as a sinking fuud, would  
reduce the quantity in circulation, so as to  
  
maintain tnat in an equilibrium with  
  
specie. It is not easy to estimate the obsta  
  
cles wh&#x27;ch, in the beginning, we should en­  
counter iu ousting the banks from their  
  
possession of the circulation ; but a steady  
and judicious alteration&#x27; of emissions and  
loans would reduce them in time. But  
while this is going on, another measure  
should be pressed to recover ultitimely our  
right to the circulation. The States should  
be applied to transfer the right of issuing  
circulating paper to Congress exclusively,  
in prrpetuum, if possible, but during the war  
at least, with a saving of charter rights. I  
  
believe that every State west aud south of  
  
Connecticut River, except Delaware, would  
immediately do it, and the others would  
follow in time. Congress would, of course,  
begin by obliging unchartered banks to  
wind up their affairs within a short time,  
and the others as their charters expired,  
forbidding the subsequent circulation of  
their paper. This they would supply with  
their own, bottomed, every emission on an  
  
adequate tax, and bearing or not bearing  
  
interest, as the state ot the public pulse  
may indicate. Even in the non-complying  
  
States, these bills would make their way.  
  
and supplant the unfounded paper of their  
  
banks by their solidity, by the universality  
  
of their currency, and by their receivability  
for customs and taxes. It would be in their  
  
power, too, to curtail those banks to the  
  
amount of their actual specie, by gathering  
  
up their paper and running it constantly  
  
on them. The national paiier miirht thus  
  
take place even in the non-complying SLates.  
Iu this war, I am not without a hope that  
  
this great, this sole resource for loans iu an  
  
agricultural country, might vet be recov  
  
ered for the use of the nation during the  
  
war; and if obtained inperpetuum, it would  
  
always be sufficient to carry us through

Gen. Field, candidate for Vice President,  
said in disoussing this plank in a recent  
speech in Atlanta: &quot;I want to see the day

it means nothing.

All the balance of our paper money  
is merely representative of coin which  
does not circulate.   
To bring conviction to any one  
who doubts Jefferson’s position on  
this most important matter, let me  
quote him further.   
In devising a means by which the  
Government might drive State Bank  
money out of circulation, he says in  
the Eppes letter, already mentioned :   
“If Treasury bills are emitted, on  
a tax appropriated for their redemp­  
tion in fifteen years, and (to insure  
their preference in the first moments  
of competition—with the notes of the  
State Bankers) bearing interest at 6  
per cent, there is no one who would  
not take them in preference to the  
Bank paper now afloat. * * * I’his  
credit once established, others might  
be emitted, bottomed also on a tax,  
but not bearing interest; and even if  
their credit faltered, open public  
loans, on which these bills alone  
should be received” as specie. These,  
operating as a sinking fund, would  
reduce the quantity in circulation, so  
as ‘to maintain v hat ru equilibrium,  
with specie. ” ‘   
This language is so plain, its mean  
ing so clear, the financial plan out­  
lined so undeniable, that I shall not  
take the trouble to quote other pas­  
sages in other documents, to th

through the expenses of a war the use of  
its credit in the shape of a currency issued  
from its treasury. A nation thus making  
its purchases and payments with bills fitted  
for circulation would be borrowing from its  
own people, and the vendor receiving pay­  
ment in a medium as effectual as coin for  
his uses and purposes, has no claim to in­  
terest. And so the nation may continue to  
issue its bills as faraa its wants require or  
the limits of circulation will admit. But,  
unfortunately, this, the only resource whioh  
the government can command with cer­  
tainty, the states have fooled away nay.cor­  
ruptly alienated to swindlers and sharpers,  
under the cover of private banks. And  
thus, as an additional evil, the disposable  
funds of individuals have been withdrawn  
from improvement and useful enterprise  
and employed in the useless, usurious and  
demoralizing practices of bank directors  
and their accomplices. In the war of 1755  
Virginia availed itself of this fund by issu­  
ing a paper money, bottomed on a redeem­  
ing tax bearing interest at first but not  
afterwards, and they were everywhere re­  
ceived and never depreciated a farthing.  
In the revolutionary war, the old congress  
and the states issued bills without interest  
and without tax, and they occupied the  
channels of circulation very freely, till these  
ohannels were overflowed by an excess be­  
yond all the calls or needs of business (and  
besides the old congress possessed no legal  
power to issue or redeem them). But al­  
though we have improvidently suffered the  
field of circulating medium to be filohed  
from us by private individuals, yet I think  
we may recover it, if the states willoo-op-erate  
with us. Then if treasury notes are  
emitted, first based on a tax and bearing in­  
terest, and after their credit was thus es­  
tablished, without interest, there is no one  
who wouldn&#x27;t take them in preference to  
the bank paper now afloat (which soon after  
petered out and went to the bottom). It is  
not easy to estimate the obstacles to be en­  
countered in ousting the banks from their  
possession and privilege, but a steady and  
judicious purpose and polioy would reduce  
them in time. Then the states should be  
applied to to transfer the right of issuing  
oiroulating paper to oongress exclusively.  
I believe every state west and south of the  
Connecticut river (except Delaware) would  
do it, and the others would follow in time.  
Congress would of course begin by obliging  
the banks to wind up their affairs as their  
! charters expired, forbidding the subsequent  
circulation of their paper. This they would  
supply with thier own, and even in the non­  
complying Btates these bills would make  
their way and supplant the unfunded bank  
paper by their solidity, the universality of  
their circulation and their reoeivability for  
oustoms and taxes. In this way I am not  
without hope that this great and sole re­  
source for loans in an agricultural country,  
may not yet be recovered for the use of the  
nation.&quot;  
And now, gentlemen, after all the  
tribulations that Mr. Jefferson indulges  
in as to the difficulty and the necessity  
of recovering this great right and power,  
and which the nation has since fortu­  
nately recovered is Mr. Cleveland and th

it in loans than otherwise, set up banks,  
and give coin or national bills for the  
notes they discount. It is from Great  
Britain we copy the idea of giving bank  
notes in exchange for discounted bills.  
And while we have derived from her  
some good principles of government and  
legislation, we unfortunately run into a  
most servile imitation of all her practices;  
and among them her bank system, which  
is carrying her rapidly to bankruptcy aa  
it did us and will do us again, and every  
country permitting paper to be circu­

present state of our circulation, are at  
the mercy of those self-created money  
lenders and are prostrated by the floods  
of nominal money with which their ava­

twenty years ago and before the insti­

wheat was well sold at $1 a bushel, and  
receives now the nominal sum of $2 a

he money volume in  
issuing gold bonds to meet expenses  
of government have all been steps  
in the right direction, and the pres­  
ent aspect of the political atmos­  
phere is that they have been, as far  
as the future of the Democratic  
party is concerned, the right kind  
of steps to retire it from taking any  
more steps in these directions. It  
is only necessary to compare Jef­  
fersonian democracy with the article  
now in the market.  
Quoting Jefferson shortly after  
the revolutionary war, the credit of  
the government being then at low  
water mark, (our population num­  
bering a few millions,) we read that  
the nation may continue to issue its  
bills (Treasury notes) as far as its  
wants require, and the limits of its  
circulation will permit, (J will add  
bottomed on a redeeming tax bear­  
ing no interest.) Those limits arc j  
understood to extend with us at  
present to 8200,000,tw0, (about  
#3,000,000,000 now on our popula­  
tion,) a greater sum than would  
be necessary for any war. Then  
referring to his State. Virginia,  
he wrote, That our State in 1755  
availed itself of this condition by  
issuing a paper money Ixotturned mi !  
a specific tax for its redemption, \
and to insure its credit, bearing an ,  
interest of 5 per cent. Within a &lt;  
very short time not a bill of this  
emission was to be found in circu­  
lation, (hoarded the same as gold ”  
is now, uuder our present system of ,  
.selling bonds to procure gold). (]  
  
Then Jefferson wrote that Vir­  
ginia issued bills (money) bottomed  
on a redeeming tax, but bearing no  
interest. These were readily re­  
ceived and never depreciated. This  
condition operated successfully in  
other colonies previous to the revo  
lotion, and insured the farmers  
prosperity.  
This leads the writer to infer that

Eppes, who was at the time chairman  
of the Committee on Ways and Means,-  
in the House of Representatives, Mr.  
Jefferson wrote, under date of Monti­  
cello, June 24th, 1- s 3, ns follows:  
“It is a wise rule, and should be f un-i  
damental in a government disposed to  
cherish its faculties, ‘never to borrow  
a dollar without laying a tax in the  
same instant for paying the interest  
annually, rod the principal within a  
given term; and to con der that tax  
as pledged to the creditors on the pub-&#x27;  
lie faith.’ * * But what limits, it  
will be asked, does this prescribe to;  
their powers? What is to hinder&#x27;  
them from creating a perpetual debt?!  
The laws of nature, I answer. The  
earth belongs to the living, not to the  
dead. The will and power of man ex­  
pire with his life, by nature’s law. * *  
The generations of men may be con­  
sidered us bodies or corporations.  
Each generation has the usufruct of  
the earth during the period of its con­  
tinuance. When it ceases to exist, the  
usufruct passes on to the succeeding  
generation, free and unencumbered,  
and so on, successively from one gen­  
eration to another forever. We may  
•oanWlcr each generation an a distinct  
  
nation, with a right, by the will of its  
majority, to bind themselves, but none  
to bind the succeeding generation,  
more than the inhabitants of another  
country. Or the case may be likened  
to the ordinary one of a tenant for  
life, w ho may hypothecate the land for  
his debts during the continuance of his  
usufruct; but at his death, the revex­  
sioner (who is for life only) receives it  
exonerated from all burthen. Mr.

ferson are apropos to the present

“In the war of 1775, our State availed  
itself of this fund by issuing a paper  
money, bottomed on a speeilic tax for  
its redemption, and, to insui&#x27;e its cred­  
it, bearing an interest of five per cent.  
Within a very short time, not a bill of  
this emission was to be found in cir­  
culation. It was locked up in the  
chests of executors, guardians,widows,  
farmers, &amp;e. We then issued bills bot­  
tomed on a redeeming tax, but bearing  
no interest. These were readily re-|  
ceived, and never depreciated a single j  
farthing. In the Revolutionary war. j  
the old Congress and the States issued j  
bills without interest, and without!  
tax. They occupied the channels of j  
circulation very freely, till those chan-j  
ueis were overflowed by an excess be- j  
yond all the calls of circulation. But  
although we have iinprovidently suf­  
fered the field of circulating medium  
to be filched from us by private indi­  
viduals, yet I think we may recover it  
in part, and even in the whole, if the !  
States will co-operate with us.

issue its bills as far as its wants re  
quire, and the limits of the circulation  
will admit. Those limits are under­  
stood to extend with us at present, to  
two hundred millions of dollars, a  
greater sum than would be necessary  
for any war. But this, the only re­  
source which the government could  
command with certainty, the States  
have unfortunately fooled away, nay  
corruptly alienated to swindlers and

that the disposed funds of individuals,  
to this amount, have thus been with­  
drawn from improvement and useful  
enterprise, and demoralizing prac­  
tices of bank directors and their ac­  
complices.&quot;The following statements of Mr. Jef­  
ferson are apropos to the present  
times. He goes on to say:  
&quot;In the war of 1775, our State availed  
itself of this fund by issuing a paper  
money, bottomed on a specific tax for  
its redemption, and, to insure its cred­  
it, bearing an interest of five per cent.  
Within a very short time, not a bill of  
this emission was to be found m cir­

chests of executors, guardians,widows,  
farmers, &amp;c. We then issued bills bot­  
tomed on a redeeming tax, but bearing  
no interest. These were readily re­

&quot;Tho generations of men may be  
considered as bodies or corporations.  
Each generation has the usufruct of the  
earth during tho period of its continu­  
ance. When it ceases to exist that usu­  
fruct passes on to tho tncceeding gener­  
ation free and unincumbered, and so on  
successively from one generation to an­  
other forever. Wo may consider each  
generation as a distinct nation, with u  
right by tho will of its majority to bind  
themselves, bet noco to bind the suc­  
ceeding generation more than the in­  
habitants of nnother country. Or tho  
case may bo likened to the ordinary one  
of a tenant for lifo, who may hypothe­  
cate the land for his debts during the  
coiitinuaiico of his usufruct, but at his  
douth tho reversioner, who is also ten­  
ant lor life only, receives it exonerated  
from all burthen. The period of n gen­  
eration or the term of its life is deter­  
mined by the laws cf mortality. I find  
that of the numbers of ail ngos living  
at any one moment half will be dead  
in 21 years and 8 months. But leaviug  
out minors, who have not the power of  
self government, of the adults living at  
one moment, a majority of whom act  
for the society, one-half will be dead in  
18 years and 8 mouths.  
&quot;At 19 years, then, from the date of  
a contract, the majority of the contract­  
ors are dead and their contract with  
them. Let this general theory be applied  
to a particular case : Suppose the annual  
births in the state of New York to bo  
28,904; the whole number of its inhab­  
itants will bo 617,703, of all ages. Of  
these, there would constantly be 2C9,­  
28G minors and 348,417 adults, of  
which last 174,209 will be a majority.  
Suppose that majority, on the first day  
of tho year 1 794, had borrowed a sum  
of money equal to tho fee simple value  
of the state and to have consumed it in  
eating, drinking and making merry in  
their day, ;r, if you please, in quarrel­  
ling and lighting with their unoffeud­  
ing neighburs. Within 18 years and 8  
months one-half of the adult citizens  
were dead. Till then, boiug the matur­  
ity, they might rightfully levy the in­  
terest of their debt annually on them­  
selves and thoir fellow revelers or fel­  
low champions. But at that period (say  
at this moment) a new majority have  
come into place iu their own right and  
not under the rights, the conditions or  
laws of their predecessors. Are they  
bound to acknowledge the debt, to  
consider the preceding generation as  
having bad a right to eat up the whole  
soil of their country in the course oi a  
lifo, to alienate it from&#x27; them (for it  
would be an alienation to the credi­  
tors), and would they think themselves  
either legally or morally bound to give  
up their country and to emigrate to  
another for subsistence? Every one will  
say no; that the soil is the gift of God  
to the living, as much as it had been to  
the decease, generation and that the  
laws of nature impose no obligation on  
them to pay this debt And although,  
like soiiio other natural rights, this has  
not yet entered into any declaration of  
rights, it is no less a law and &quot;ought to

insure its credit, bearing an interest
