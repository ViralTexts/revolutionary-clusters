Besides this Trade Carried on between the British American Colonies in general, especially those of the West Indies, &amp; the Spanish, there had for a long time Subsisted one equally extensive, between the British Colonies (especially those on the Continent of North America) and the French West Indies. This Trade was permitted to be carried on for a long time during the war (of 1756) between Great Britain &amp; France, directly, by means of flags of Truce  
  
(a)French Flags of Truce Sent from time to time from St. Domingo to Jamaica, as the occasion of the War required, the merchants wh[o] owned the flags of Truce clandestinely put on board cotton &amp; Indigo for the Jamaica market, not, perhaps, without the Connivance of the officers of the French Government.

“given in Evidence that thirty thousand people about Manchester, were employed in the Velvet manufactory, for which the St. Domingo Cotton was best adapted, &amp; that Indigo had been imported from Jamaica at least Thirty per Cent cheaper than the same could have been procured at thro’ France; the house, disregarding all Colonial opposition, came to a resolution ‘that the continuance of free ports in Jamaica would be highly beneficial to the Trade and Manufactures of the Kingdom.’ That act was thereupon renewed &amp; has since been made perpetual.” 1 Edw: 252.

 as follows “This Capture was certainly unjust. The pretence was that part of this Cargo was put on board off St. Eustatius by French boats from a French Island. This is now a Settled point by the Lords of appeals, to be the same thing as if they had been landed on the Dutch Shore, &amp; then put on board afterwards; in which case there is no Colour for Seizure. The Rule is, that if a neutral Ship Trades to a French Colony, with all the privileges of a French Ship, and is thus adopted and naturalized, it must be looked upon as a French Ship, &amp; is liable to be taken—not so, if She has only French produce on board, without taking it at a French port, for it may be purchased of Neutrals.”

 directions” Says Edwards “to enforce their Laws of Navigation with the utmost rigour; and the Captains of British men of war had custom house Commissions given to them, with orders to Seize indiscriminately all foreign Vessels that should be found in the ports of our West India Islands, a measure which in reality Converted the British navy into Guarda Costas for the Spanish King. The Spaniards by these proceedings, were deterred from approaching near us; and in the year 1765 the exports from great Britain to Jamaica alone in the year 1765 fell short of the year 1763. £168000 Sterling.  
“A wiser minister endeavoured to remedy the mischief by giving orders for the admission of Spanish Vessels as usual, but the Subject matter being canvassed in the British Parliament, the Nature and intent of those orders were so fully explained, that the Spanish Court, grown wise from experience, took the alarm, and immediately adopted a measure, equally prompt &amp; prudent for counteracting them. This was laying open the trade to the Islands of Trinidad, Porto Rico, Hispaniola &amp; Cuba ‘to Every Province in Spain,[’] &amp; permitting goods of all kinds to be sent thither, on the payment of moderate Duties, Thus the temptation of an illicit commerce with foreign Nations being in a great measure removed, there was reason to believe that the effect would Cease with the Cause.  
“Such, however, is the Superiority or comparative cheapness of British manufactures, that it is probable the Trade would have been revived to a Certain degree if the British Ministry of 1765 after giving orders for the admission of Spanish Vessels into our ports, had proceeded no further, but in the following year they obtained an Act from Parliament for opening the chief ports of Jamaica &amp; Dominica, to all foreign Vessels of a certain description—The Jealousy of Spain was awakened, and the endeavours of the British Parliament on this occasion Served only to encrease the evil which was meant to be redressed—By an unfortunate over Sight the Collectors at the Several British free ports were instructed to keep regular accounts of the entry of all foreign Vessels, &amp; of the bullion which they imported, together with the names of their Commanders. These accounts having been transmitted to England, copies of them were by Some means procured by the Court of Spain, and occasioned the absolute destruction of the poor people, who had been concerned in the business. Information of this being transmitted to the British ministry, the former Instructions were revoked, but the remedy came too late, for what else could be expected than that the Spaniards would naturally shun all intercourse with a people, whom neither the safety of their friends; nor their own evident interest, was sufficient to engage the Confidence and Secrecy?  
“The little Trade therefore which now (about the year 1793.) Subsists with the Subjects of Spain in America, is chiefly carried on by small vessels from Jamaica, which contrive to elude the Vigilence of the Guarda Costas.

“It is possible,” Says mr. Jordan “to open a South American trade, as well as that of North America, which, without any respect to the nature of the Shipping employed, shall, by a due enumeration &amp; restriction of the permitted articles of exchange or carriage, with perfect Safety &amp; propriety encrease indefinitely the British import, export and carrying trade of the West India Islands.  
“These Islands are so disposed along the coasts or Stretched across between the principal points of North &amp; South America, that access to them from both the continents may at all times be had by the simplest &amp; cheapest Species of Navigation. The approach [of] British vessels to the continent of South America is partially or totally forbidden by the Great Europe an Powers who possess it—Under these circumstances British Vessels cannot be used in the intercourse with it. Great Britain, therefore of necessity indeed, but with her accustomed wisdom, has opened certain ports in the Colonies to Vessels of these foreign Countries, in order that they may bring in the enumerated Articles she desires to obtain, and that they carry the enumerated Articles She wishes to dispose of, or such as are necessary to support the trade. The first enumeration contains articles of Territorial produce of that part of the continent, and bullion among the rest; the other consists of goods of British Manufactures, or import or articles of territorial produce of the Islands. Great Britain does not upon this occasion consider her navigation and colonial Systems, as not at any time, upon any occasion, or under any circumstances to be invaded. She looks to the objects and purposes of those Systems. She wants raw materials, She wants markets for her various articles of manufacture, commerce &amp; produce; She wants encouragement &amp; extensive employment for her Shipping. By neglecting all consideration of the use as militating against her navigation and colonial Systems, of those petty vessels which serve to associate her islands with the continent, She obtains all the objects of those Systems, materials, markets, and increased carriage. The ports of her Islands become ports of the continent, and those Vessels are only as the port Vessels and laden droghers of other countries. British Ships carry to and bring away from the Islands the commodities laden in and unladen from these Vessels, and neither their employment nor their Numbers is to be calculated upon by Great Britain, but as proofs of the extension of her own commerce and proper Navigation.  
“Instead, therefore of a port in Grenada a port in Dominica Two in Jamaica, one in Tortola, one in the Bahamas, it might upon these principles well be recommended to Great Britain, to extend the provisions of the freeport Acts to all the Islands, or to the Custom house ports of all the Islands. It might further be proposed by enlarging and combining all the principles &amp; practice which alike prevail in the West India intercourse with the Northern and Southern portions of America, to form a general, Simple &amp; consolidated System, that should connect them all, which should embrace and comprehend the at present enumerated articles of import and export between the whole continent and the Islands, and permitt between them the employment jointly with British ships of one decked vessels of all the Countries growing the commodities imported into the Islands.”

‘ These islands are.so disposed along the coasts, or stretched across  
  
between the principal points of South and North America, that ac-  
cess to them trom both the continents may at all times be had by the  
simplest and cheapest species of navigation. The approach of British  
vessels to the continent of South America is partially or totally forbid-  
den by the great European powers who possess it. Under these cir-  
cumstances, British vessels cannot be used in the intercourse with  
it. Great Britain, therefore, of necessity indeed, but with her ac-  
customed wisdom, has opened certain ports in the colonies to vessels  
of these foreign countries, in order that they may bring in the enume-  
rated articles she desires to obtain, and that they may carry the enu-  
merated articles she wishes to dispose of, or such as are necessary to  
support the trade. The first enumeration contains articles of terri-  
torial produce of that part of the continent, and bullion among the  
rest ; the other consists of goods of British manufacture, or import, or  
articles of territorial produce of the islands. Great Britaiit does not  
upon this occasion consider her riavigation and colonial systems, as  
not at any time, upon any occasion, or under any circumstances to be  
invaded. She looks to the objects and purposes of those systems.  
She wants raw materials ; she wants markets for her various articles of  
manufacture, commerce, and produce ; she wants encouragement and  
extensive employment for her shipping. By neglecting all considera-  
tion of the use, as militating against her navigation and colonial sys-  
tems, of these petty vessels, which serve to associate her islands with  
the continent, she obtains all the objects of those systems; materials,  
markets, and increased carriage. ‘The ports of her islands become  
  
orts of the continent, and these vessels are only as the port vessels and  
lading droghers of other countries. British ships carry to; and bring  
away from the islands the commodities laden 4n, and unladen from  
these vessels, and neither their employment or their numbers is to be  
contemplated or calculated upon by Great Britain, but as proofs of  
the extension of her own commerce and proper navigation.  
  
‘ Instead, therefore, of a port in Grenada, a port in Dominica, two  
in Jamaica, one in Tortola, one in the Bahamas, it might upon these  
principles well be recommended to Great Britain, to extend the provi-  
sions of the Free Port Acts to all the islands, or to the Custom-house  
ports of all the islands. It might further be proposed, by enlarging  
and combining all the principles and practices which alike prevail in the  
West India intercourse with the Northern and Southern portions of  
America, to form one general, simple, and consolidated system, that  
should connect them af which should embrace and comprehend the at  
present enumerated articles of import and export between the whale  
continent and the islands, and permit between them the employment,  
jointly with British ships, of one decked vessels, of all the countries  
growing the commodities imported into the islands. I submit thi

- It 13 potftUNe to open a oouui amc«  
rican trade, as wells* that of North A*  
meric*, which without any respect to  
the nature of the shipping employ mem,  
shall by a due enumeration and rcstricti-&#x27;  
on of the permitted articles, of exchange  
or carriage with perfect safety, and pro­  
priety,&#x27;increase tnde finitely the British&#x27;  
import, export, and carrying trade, of  
the West India islands.  
** These islands are so disposed along  
the coasts, or stretched across between  
the principal points of South and North  
America, that aches* to them from both  
the continents may at all times be had by  
rite simplest and cheapest species of na­  
vigation. The approach of British ves­  
sels to the continent of South America is  
partially or totally forbidden by the great  
European powers who possess it. Un­  
der these circumstances, British vessels  
cannot be used in the intercourse with it.  
Great Britain therefore, of necessity in­  
deed, but with her accustomed wisdom,  
has opened certain ports in the colonies  
to vessels of these foreign countries, in  
order that they may bring the enumerat­  
ed articles she desires to obtain, and that  
they carry the enumerated articles she  
wishes to dispose of, or such as are ne­  
cessary to support the trade. The first  
enumeration contain* article sof territori­  
al produce of that part of the continent,  
aba bullion among the rest; the other  
consists of goods of British manufacture,  
or import, or articles of territorial pro­  
duce of the islands. Great Britain does  
not upon this occasion consider her na­  
vigation and colonial systems, as not at  
any time, upon any occasion, or under  
any circumstances to be invaded. She  
looks to the objects and purposes of those  
  
systems. She wants raw materials; she  
wants markets for her various articles of  
manufacture, commerce, and produce ; .  
she wants encouragement and extensive  
employment.for her shipping. By ne­  
glecting all consideration of the use, as  
militating againt her navigation and co­  
lonial systems, of these petty vessels,  
which serve to associate her islands with  
the continent, she obtains all the objects  
of those systems, materials, -markets,  
and increased carriage. The porta of  
her islands become tnc ports of the conti­  
nent, and these vessels ake only as the  
port vessels and lading droghers of other  
countries.&#x27; British ships carry to, and  
bring away from the islands the commo­  
dities laden in; and unladen from these  
vessels, and neither their employment ^7  
or their numbers is to be contemplated  
or calculated upon by Great Britain, but  
aa proofs of the extension of her own  
commerce and proper navigation* , - *  
&#x27; “ Inhead, therefore, of i port in Gre­  
nado, 4 port in Dominico, two in Ja­  
maica, «&gt;n* in Tortola, one in the Baha­  
mas, it might upon these principles well  
be recommended to Great Britain, to  
extend the provisions of the Free Port  
Acts to all the islands, or to the custom  
house ports of all the islands. It might

The pretence was, that part of this cargo was put on board off  
St. Eustatius, out of barks supposed to come from the French  
islands, and not.Joaded immediately from the shore.. This is  
now a settled point by the lords of appeal, to be the same thing  
as if they had been landed .on the Dutch shore, and then put  
on board“ afterwards; in which case there is no colour for™  
seizure. The rule is, that if a neutral ship trade to a French  
colony, with all the privileges of a French ship, and is thus adapt-  
ed and naturalized, it must be looked, upon as a French ship, and  
is liable to be taken. Not so if she have only French produce  
on board, without taking it in at a French port, for it may be  
purchased of neutrals.
