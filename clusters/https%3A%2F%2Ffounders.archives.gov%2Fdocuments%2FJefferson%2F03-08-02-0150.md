believe the good if we candidly tell them the bad also.  
But you have two more serious causes of uneasiness; the want of men &amp; money. for the former nothing more wise, nor efficient could have been imagined than what you proposed. it would have filled our ranks with regulars, &amp; that too by throwing a just share of the burthen on the purses of those whose persons are exempt either by age or office; and it would have rendered our militia, like those of the Greeks &amp; Romans, a nation of warriors. but the go-by seems to have been given to your proposition, and longer sufferance is necessary to force us to what is best.—we seem equally incorrigible in our financial course. altho’ a century of British experience has proved to what a wonderful extent the funding on specific redeeming taxes enables a nation to anticipate in war the resources of peace, and altho’ the other nations of Europe have tried and trodden every path of force or folly in fruitless quest of the same object, yet we still expect to find in juggling tricks and banking dreams, that money can be made out of nothing, and in sufficient quantity to meet the expences of a heavy war by sea and land.it is said indeed that money cannot be borrowed from our merchants as from those of England. but it can be borrowed from the our people. they will give you all the necessaries of war they produce, if, instead of the bankrupt trash they now are obliged to recieve for want of any other, you will give them a paper promise funded on a specific pledge, and of a size for common circulation. but you say the merchants will not take this paper. what the people take the merchants must take, or sell nothing. all these doubts &amp; fears prove only the extent of the dominion which the banking institutions have obtained over the minds of our citizens, and especially of those inhabiting cities, or other banking places: and this dominion must be broken, or it will break us. but here, as in the other case, we must make up our mind to suffer yet longer before we can get right. the misfortune is that in the mean time we shall plunge ourselves into inextinguishable debt, and  entail on our posterity an inheritance of eternal taxes, which will bring our government &amp; people into the condition of those of England, a nation of pikes &amp; gudgeons, the latter bred merely as food for the former.—but however these

7. Parer-cuRRENCY AND Banxs.—‘‘ We seem equally incorrigible  
in our financial course. Although a century of British experience has  
proved to what a wonderful extent the funding on specific taxes enables  
a nation to anticipate in war the resources of peace, and although the  
other nations of Europe have tried and trodden every path of force or  
folly in fruitless quest of the same object, yet we still expect to find in  
juggling tricks and banking dreams, that money can be made out of  
nothing, and in sufficient quantity to meet the expenses of a heavy war by  
sea and land. It is said, indeed, that money cannot be borrowed from our  
merchants, as from those of England: but it can be borrowed from our  
  
eople. They will give you all the necessaries of war they produce, if,  
instead of the bankrupt trash they are now obliged to receive for want of  
any other, you will give them a paper promise, founded on a specific pledge,  
and of a size for common circulation. But you say the merchants will not  
take this paper. What the people take the merchants must take, or sell  
nothing. All these doubts and fears prove only the extent of all the  
dominion which the banking institutions have obtained over the minds of  
our citizens, and especially of those inhabiting cities or other banking  
places ; and this dominion must be broken, or it will break us. But here,  
as in the other case, we must make up our mind to suffer yet longer, before  
we can get right. The misfortune is, that in the meantime we shall plunge  
ourselves into inextinguishable debt, and entail on our posterity an inhe-  
ritance of eternal taxes, which will bring our government and people into  
the condition of those of England, a nation of pikes and gudgeons, the  
latter bred merely as food for the former.””—Vol. iv. p. 251.
