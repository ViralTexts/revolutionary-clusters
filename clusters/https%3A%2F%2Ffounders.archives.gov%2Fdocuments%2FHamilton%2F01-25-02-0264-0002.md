Instead of delivering a speech to the House of Congress, at the opening of the present session, the President has thought fit to transmit a Message. Whether this has proceeded from pride or from humility, from a temperate love of reform, or from a wild spirit of innovation, is submitted to the conjectures of the curious. A single observation shall be indulged—since all agree, that he is unlike his predecessors in essential points, it is a mark of consistency to differ from them in matters of form.  
Whoever considers the temper of the day, must be satisfied that this message is likely to add much to the popularity of our chief magistrate. It conforms, as far as would be tolerated at this early stage of our progress in political perfection, to the bewitching tenets of that illuminated doctrine, which promises man, ere long, an emancipation from the burdens and restraints of government; giving a foretaste of that pure felicity which the apostles of this doctrine have predicted. After having, with infinite pains and assiduity, formed the public taste for this species of fare, it is certainly right for those whom the people have chosen for their caterers, to be attentive to the gratification of that taste. And should the viands, which they may offer, prove baneful poisons instead of wholesome aliments, the justification is both plain and easy—Good patriots must, at all events, please the People. But those whose patriotism is of the Old School, who differ so widely from the disciples of the new creed, that they would rather risk incurring the displeasure of the people, by speaking unpalatable truths, than betray their interest by fostering their prejudices; will never be deterred by an impure tide of popular opinion, from honestly pointing out the mistakes or the faults of weak or wicked men, who may have been selected as guardians of the public weal.  
The Message of the President, by whatever motives it may have been dictated, is a performance which ought to alarm all who are anxious for the safety of our Government, for the respectability and welfare of our nation. It makes, or aims at making, a most prodigal sacrifice of constitutional energy, of sound principle, and of public interest, to the popularity of one man.  
The first thing in it which excites our surprise, is the very extraordinary position, that though Tripoli had declared war in form against the United States, and had enforced it by actual hostility, yet that there was not power, for want of the sanction of Congress, to capture and detain her cruisers with their crews.  
When the newspapers informed us, that one of these cruisers, after being subdued in a bloody conflict, had been liberated and permitted quietly to return home, the imagination was perplexed to divine the reason. The conjecture naturally was, that pursuing a policy, too refined perhaps for barbarians, it was intended by that measure to give the enemy a strong impression of our magnanimity and humanity. No one dreampt of a scruple as to the right to seize and detain the armed vessel of an open and avowed foe, vanquished in battle. The enigma is now solved, and we are presented with one of the most singular paradoxes, ever advanced by a man claiming the character of a statesman. When analyzed, it amounts to nothing less than this, that between two nations there may exist a state of complete war on the one side—of peace on the other.  
War, of itself, gives to the parties a mutual right to kill in battle, and to capture the persons and property of each other. This is a rule of natural law; a necessary and inevitable consequence of the state of war. This state between two nations is completely produced by the act of one—it requires no concurrent act of the other. It is impossible to conceive the idea, that one nation can be in full war with another, and this other not in the same state with respect to its adversary. The moment therefore that two nations are, in an absolute sense, at war, the public force of each may exercise every act of hostility, which the general laws of war authorise, against the persons and property of the other. As it respects this conclusion, the distinction between offensive and defensive war, makes no difference. That distinction is only material to discriminate the aggressing nation from that which defends itself against attack. The war is offensive on the part of the state which makes it; on the opposite side it is defensive: but the rights of both, as to the measure of hostility, are equal.  
It will be readily allowed that the Constitution of a particular country may limit the Organ charged with the direction of the public force, in the use or application of that force, even in time of actual war: but nothing short of the strongest negative words, of the most express prohibitions, can be admitted to restrain that Organ from so employing it, as to derive the fruits of actual victory, by making prisoners of the persons and detaining the property of a vanquished enemy. Our Constitution happily is not chargeable with so great an absurdity. The framers of it would have blushed at a provision, so repugnant to good sense, so inconsistent with national safety and inconvenience. That instrument has only provided affirmatively, that, “The Congress shall have power to declare War;” the plain meaning of which is that, it is the peculiar and exclusive province of Congress, when the nation is at peace, to change that state into a state of war; whether from calculations of policy or from provocations or injuries received: in other words, it belongs to Congress only, to go to War. But when a foreign nation declares, or openly and avowedly makes war upon the United States, they are then by the very fact, already at war, and any declaration on the part of Congress is nugatory: it is at least unnecessary. This inference is clear in principle, and has the sanction of established practice. It is clear in principle, because it is self-evident, that a declaration by one nation against another, produce[s] at once a complete state of war between both; and that no declaration on the other side can at all vary their relative situation: and in practice it is well known, that nothing is more common, than when war is declared by one party, to prosecute mutual hostilities, without a declaration by the other.  
The doctrine of the Message includes the strange absurdity, that, without a declaration of war by Congress, our public force may destroy the life, but may not restrain the liberty, or seize the property of an enemy. This was exemplified in the very instance of the Tripolitan corsair. A number of her crew were slaughtered in the combat, and after she was subdued she was set free with the remainder. But it may perhaps be said, that she was the assailant, and that resistance was an act of mere defence, and self-preservation. Let us then pursue the matter a step further. Our ships had blockaded the Tripolitan Admiral in the bay of Gibraltar; suppose, he had attempted to make his way out, without first firing upon them: if permitted to do it, the blockade was a farce; if hindered by force, this would have amounted to more than a mere act of defence; and if a combat had ensued, we should then have seen an unequivocal illustration of the unintelligible right, to take the life but not to abridge the liberty, or capture the property of an enemy.  
Let us suppose an invasion of our territory, previous to a declaration of war by Congress. The principle avowed in the Message would authorize our troops to kill those of the invader, if they should come within the reach of their bayonets, perhaps to drive them into the sea, and drown them; but not to disable them from doing harm, by the milder process of making them prisoners, and sending them into confinement. Perhaps it may be replied, that the same end would be answered by disarming and leaving them to starve. The merit of such an argument would be complete by adding, that should they not be famished, before the arrival of their ships, with a fresh supply of arms, we might then, if able, disarm them a second time, and send them on board their fleet, to return safely home.  
The inconvenience of the doctrine in practice, is not less palpable than its folly in theory. In every case it presents a most unequal warfare. In the instance which has occurred, the vanquished Barbarian got off with the loss of his guns. Had he been victorious, the Americans, whose lives might have been spared, would have been doomed to wear out a miserable existence in slavery and chains. Substantial benefits would have rewarded his success; while on our side, life, liberty and property, were put in jeopardy, for an empty triumph. This, however, was a partial inconvenience—cases may arise in which evils of a more serious and comprehensive nature wou’d be the fruits of this visionary and fantastical principle. Suppose that, in the recess of Congress, a foreign maritime power should unexpectedly declare war against the United States, and send a fleet and army to seize Rhode-Island, in order from thence to annoy our trade and our seaport towns. Till the Congress should assemble and declare war, which would require time, our ships might, according to the hypothesis of the Message, be sent by the President to fight those of the enemy as often as they should be attacked, but not to capture and detain them: If beaten, both vessels and crews whould be lost to the United States: if successful, they could only disarm those they had overcome, and must suffer them to return to the place of common rendezvous, there to equip anew, for the purpose of resuming their depredations on our towns and our trade.  
Who could restrain the laugh of derision at positions so preposterous, were it not for the reflection that in the first magistrate of our country, they cast a blemish on our national character? What will the world think of the fold when such is the shepherd?

AN EXAMINATION OF THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.  
NUMBER I.  
  
Instead of delivering a speech to the house of  
congress, at the opening of the present session, the  
president has thought fit to transmit a messages...  
Whether this has proceeded from pride, or from  
humility, from a temperate love of reform, or from  
a wild spirit of innovation, is submitted to the con-  
jectures of the curious. A single observation  
shall be indulged....since all agree, that he is unlike  
his predecessors in essential points, it is a mark of  
consistency, to differ from them in matters of form.  
  
Whoever considers the temper of the day, must  
be satisfied, that this message is likely to add  
much to the popularity of our chief magistrate. It  
conforms, as far as would be tolerated, at this early  
stage of our progress in political perfection, to the  
bewitching tenets of that illuminated doctrine,  
which promises man, ere long, an emancipation  
from the burdens and restraints of government;  
giving a foretaste of that pure felicity, which the  
apostles of this doctrine have predicted. After  
Raving, with infinite pains and assiduity, formed  
the public taste for this species of fare, it 1s cer-  
tainly right, for those whom the people have  
chosen for their caterers, to be attentive to the  
gratification of that taste. And, should the viands,  
which théy may offer, prove baneful poisons, 1n-  
stead of wholesome aliments, the justification is  
both plain and easy.....Good patriots must, at all  
events, please the people. But those, whose patriot-  
ism is of the oLp scHooL, who differ so widely  
from the disciples of the new creed, that they  
would rather risk incurring the displeasure of the  
people, by speaking unpalatable truths, than betray  
their interest, by fostering their prejudices, will  
never be deterred, by an impure tide of popular  
opinion, from honestly pointing out the mistakes  
or the faults;of weak or wicked men, who may  
have been selected, as guardians of the publi¢ weal.  
  
The message of the president, by whatever mo-  
tives it may have been dictated, is a performance  
which ought to alarm all, who are anxious for the  
safety of our government, for the repectability and  
welfare of ournation. It. makes, or_aims at mak-  
ing, a most prodigal sacrifice of constitutional  
energy, of sound principle, and of public interest,  
for the popularity of one man. :  
  
The first thing in it, which excites our surprise,  
is the very extraordinary position, that, though  
Tripoli had declared war, in form. against the United  
States, and had enforced it by actual hostility, yet  
that there was not power, for want of the sanction  
of congress, to capture and detain her cruizers,  
with their crews.  
  
When the newspapers informed us, that one of  
these cruizers, after being subdued in a bloody  
conflict, had been liberated, and permitted quietly  
to return home, the imagination was per lexed to

that, pursuing a policy, too refined perhaps for  
  
  
  
barbarians, it was intended, by that measure, to  
give the enemy a strong impression of our mag-  
nanimity and humanity. No one dreamt of a  
scruple, as to the right to seize and detain the  
armed vessel of an open and avowed foe, van-  
quished in battle. The enigma is now solved, and  
we are presented with one of the most singular  
paradoxes ever advanced, by a man, claiming the  
character of a statesman. When analyzed, it  
amounts to nothing less than this, that detween two  
nations, there may exist a state of complete war  
on the one side....of peace on the other.  
  
_ War, of itself, gives, to the parties, a mutual  
right to kill in battle, and to capture the persons  
and property of each other. This is a rule of natural  
law; a necessary and inevitable consequence of  
the state of war. This state, between two nations,  
1s completely produced by the act of oné.....it re-

solute sense, at war, the public force of each may  
exercise every act of hostility, which the general  
laws of war authorise, against the persons and pro-  
perty of theother. As it respects this conclusion,  
the distinction between offensive and defensive  
war, makes no difference. That distinction is  
only material, to discriminate the aggressing  
nation, from that which defends itself against at-  
tack. The war is offensive, on the part of the  
state which makes it; on the opposite side, it is  
defensive: but the rights of both, as to the mea-  
sure of hostility, are equal.  
  
It will be readily allowed, that the constitution  
of a particular country may limit the organ, charg-  
ed with the direction of the public force, in the  
use or application of that force, even in time of  
actual war: but nothing short of the strongest ne-

stitution, happily, is not chargeable with so great

when the nation is at peace, to change that state, into a  
state of war; whether from calculations of policy,  
or from provocations, or injuries received: in other  
words, it belongs to congress only, to goto war. But,  
when a foreign nation declares, or openly and avow-  
edly makes war, upon the United States, they are  
then, by the very fact, already at war, and any decla-  
ration, on the part of congress, is nugatory: it is, at

The doctrine of the message includes the  
strange absurdity, that, without a declaration of  
war, by congress, our public force may destroy  
the life, but may not restrain the liberty, or seize  
the property-of an enemy. This was exemplified  
in the very instance of the Tripolitan corsair. A  
number of her crew were slaughtered in the com-

Let us then pursue the matter a step further.  
Our ships had blockaded the Tripolitan admiral,

to make his way out, without first firing upon

amounted to more than a mere act of defence ;  
and, ifa combat had ensued, we should then have  
seen an unequivocal illustration of the unintelligi-  
ble right, to take the life, but not to abridge the  
liberty, or capture the property of an enemy.  
  
Let us suppose an invasion of our territory, pre-  
vious to a declaration of war by congress. The  
principle avowed in the message, would authorize  
our troops to kill those of the invader, if they  
should come within the reach of their bayonets, per-  
haps to drive them into the sea, and drown them;  
but not to disable them from doing harm, by the  
milder process of making them prisoners, and

terred by an impure tide of popular opinion,  
from honeftly pointing out the miftakes or  
the faults of weak or wicked men, who may  
have been felefted as guardians of the public  
weal.  
  
The Meflage of the Prefident, by whatev-  
er motives it may have been dittated,is a per-  
formance which ought to alarm all who are  
anxious for the fatety of our Government, for  
the refpettability and welfare of our nation.  
It makes, or aims at making, a molt prodigal  
facrifice of conftitutional energy, of found  
principle, and of public intereit, to the pop-  
ularity of one man.  
  
The firft thing in it which excites our fur-  
rife, is the very extraordinary pofition, that  
though Tripoli had declared war in form ges  
gainft the United States, and had entorced®  
by actual hoftility, yet that there was not pow-  
er, for want of the fandlion of Congre/s, to  
capture and detain her cruifers with their  
  
crews.  
  
When the newfpapers informed us, that  
one of thefe cruifers, after being fubdued in  
a bloody confliét, had been liberated and per-  
mitted quietly to return home, the imagina-  
tion was perplexed to divine the reafon.—  
The conjeéture naturally was, that purfuing  
a policy, too refined perhaps tor barbarians,  
it was intended by that meafure to give the  
enemy a ftrong impreffion of our magnanimi-  
ty and humanity. No one dreampt of a fcru-  
ple as to the right to feize and detain the  
armed veffel of an open and avowed foe, van-  
quifhed in battle. The enigma is now folv-  
ed, and we are prefented with one of the moft  
fingular paradoxes ever advanced by a man  
claiming the charatter of a ftatefman. When  
analyzed, it amounts to nothing lefs than this,  
  
  
  
that de¢ween two nations there may exift a  
{tate of complete war on the one fide—of ,  
peace on the other.  
War, of itfelf, gives to the parties a mutual |  
right to killin battle, and to capture the per- |  
fons and property of each other. This 1s a  
rule of natural law ; a neceflary and inevita- |  
ble confequence of the ftate of war. This |  
{tate between two nations is completely pro. |  
duced by theaét of one—it requires no con. |  
current aét ofthe other. It is impollible to |  
conceive the idea, that one nation can be in |  
full war with another, and this other not in|  
the fame ftate with refpeét to its adverfary, |  
The moment therefore that two nations are,  
in an abfolute fenfe, at war, the public force |  
of each may exercife every aét of hoftility, |  
which the general laws of war authorife, a-  
gainlt the perfons and property of the other.  
As it refpe&amp;s this conclufion, the diftine-  
tion between offenfive and detenfive war,  
makes no difference. That diflinétion is on-  
  
‘  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Che Balance,  
  
  
  
  
  
ly material to difcriminate the aggrefling na-  
tion trom that which defends itfelt againft at-  
tack. ‘The war is offenfive on the part of the  
{tate which makes it ; on the oppolite fide it  
is defenfive : but the rights of both, as to the  
meafure of hoftility, are equal.  
  
It will be readily allowed that the Confti-  
tution of a particular country may limit the  
Organ charged with the direttion of the pub-  
lic force, in the ufe or application of that  
force, even in time of actual war : but noth-  
ing {hort of the ftrongeft_ negative words, ot  
the moft exprefs prohibitions, can be admit-  
ted to reftrain that Organ from fo employing  
it, as to derive the fruits of aétual victory, by  
making prifoners of the perfons and detaining  
the property of a vanquifhed enemy. Our  
Conftitution happily, 1s not chargeable with  
fo great an abfurdity. The framers of it  
would have blufhed ata provifion, fo repug-  
nant to good fenfe, fo inconfiftent with na-  
tional fatety and inconvenience : That inftru-  
ment has only provided affirmatively, that,  
‘¢ The Congrefs fhall have power to declare  
War ;” the plain&#x27;meaning of which is that  
is the peculiar and exclulive province ot!  
Congrefs, when the nation is at peace, to  
change that flate into a ftate of war ; whether  
from calculations of policy or from provoca-  
tions or injuries received : in other words, it  
belongs to Congrefs only, to go to War.—  
But when a foreign nation declares, or open-  
ly and avowedly makes war upon the United  
States, they are then by the very fact, already  
at war,and any declaration on the part of  
Congrefs is nugatory ; it isas leaft unnecefl-  
ary. This inference is clear in principle, and  
has the fanétion of eftablifhed prattice. It is  
clear in principle, becaufe it is felt-evident,  
that a declaration by one nation againft anoth-  
er, produces at once a complete ftate of war  
between both ; and that no declaration on the  
other fide can at all vary their relative fitua-  
tion ; and in practice it is well known, that  
nothing 1s more common, than when war is  
declared by one party, to profecute mutual  
hoftiities, without a declaration by the other.  
  
The doétrine of the Meffage includes the  
ftrange abfurdity, that, wuhout a declaration  
of war by Congrefs, our public dorce may  
deftroy the life, but may not reflrain thé lib-  
erty, or feize the property of an enemy.—  
  
This was exemplified in the very inftance of  
  
the Tripolitan corfair. A number of her  
créw were flaughtered in the combat, and af-  
ter the was fubdued fhe was fet free with the  
remainder. Butitmay perhaps be faid, that  
fhe was the affailant, and that refiflance was  
anact of mere defence, and felt-prefervation.  
Let us then purfue the matter a flep further.  
Our fhips had blockaded the Tripolitan Ad-  
miral in the bay of Gibraltar ; fuppofe, he  
had attempted to make his way out, without  
firft firing upon them : if permitted to do it,  
the&quot;blockade was a farce ; if hindered by  
force, this would have amounted to more than

of their bayonets, perhaps to drive them into  
the fea, and drownthems but not to difable  
them from doing harm, by the milder procefs  
of making them prifoners, and fending them  
into confinement. Perhaps it may. be repli.  
ed, that the fame end would be afives a  
difarming and leaving them to flarve. —  
mexit of {uch amargument would becom  
by adding, that fhould they not be-  
before the arrival of their fhips, with a freth

| THE Meflage of the President, by what­  
, ever motives it may have been diftat­  
ed, is o performance which ought to alarm  
all who are anxious for the fafety of our  
s ee omrut g Tov the refneftability and wel­  
fare of our nation. lt makcs, or aims at  
makinﬁ. a most prodigal {acrific confli­  
tutiona eo\gy, of found principle, and of  
public interch, to_the “popularity. of -one  
m‘ao i  
The firfl: thing in it which excites our  
furprile, is the very extraprdinary position, i  
that though Tripoli had declared war in  
form against the United States, and had en- 1  
forced it by aflual hostility, yet that there  
was not_power, for want of tke fanélion of  
Congress, to capture and detain her cruiflers  
“with their crews.  
When the newf{papers informed us, that i  
one of these cruisers, after being subdued in  
a bloody confli&amp;, had been liberated and per­  
mitted quietly to return home, the imagina­  
tion was perplexed to divine the reason.  
The conjefture natarally was, that pursuing  
a policy, too refined perhaps for barbarians,  
it was intended by that measure to give the  
enemy a firong impression of our magnani­  
mity and humanity. No one dreamt of a  
feruple as to the right to seize and detain the  
armed veflel of an open and avowed foe van­  
quithed in battle. The enigma is now (ol­  
ved, and we are presented with one of the  
most singular paradoxes ever advanced by a  
man claiming the charafter of a ftate{man.  
—When analyzed, it amounts to nothing  
less than this, that between two nations there  
may exist a state of complete war on the one  
fide—of peace on the other.  
War, of itfelf, gives to the pariies a mu­  
tual right to kill in battle, - and to capture  
the persons and property of ~ each other.  
This is a rule of nataral law ; a necessary  
and inevitable consequence of the slate of  
war. This slate between two nations is  
completely produced by the a&amp;t of one—it  
requires no concurrent aft of the other. It  
is Impossible to conceive the idea that one  
nation can be in full war with another, and  
this oth€r not in the fame {tate with refpe&amp;  
tei “ts adversary. - The mement, therefore,  
that two nations are, in an aplofute feuis, at  
war, the putlic force of each may exercise  
every a&amp;t of hoflility, which the general laws  
of war authorife, against the persons and  
property of the other. As it refpeéls this  
conclusion, the diftin&amp;ion beiween the of­  
fenfive and defenfive war makes no differ­  
ence. That diftin&amp;tion is only material to  
@ifcriminate the aggreffing nation from that  
which defends itfelf again attack. The  
war is offenfive on the part of the state which  
makes it ; on the opposite fide, it is defen­  
five ; but the rights of both, as to the mea­  
sure of hostility, are equal.  
It will be readily allowed that the Con­  
flitution of a particular country may limit  
the Organ charged with the dire€tion of the  
public force, in the use or application of  
that force, even in time of a&amp;ual war ; but  
nothing short es the firongeft negative words,  
of the most express prohibitions, can be ad­  
mitted to restrain that Organ from so em­  
ploying it, as to derive the fruits of aftual  
viftory, by making prisoners of the persons  
and detaining the property of a vanquished  
enemy. Our Conflitution, bappily, is not  
chargeable with so great an 2blurdity. The  
framers of it would have blushed at.a provi­  
sion, so repugnaot to good sense, and so in­  
consistent with national fafety-,~~—That in­  
flrument has only provided, affirmatively,  
that ¢¢ The Congress shall have power to de- i  
clare war ;” the plain meaning of which is,  
that it is the peculiar and exclusive province i  
of Congrels, when the nation is at peace, to  
change that slate into a slate of war; wheth­  
er from calcalations of policy or from pro­  
vocations or injuries received : in other  
words, it belongs to Congress only, 0 go to  
war. Bat when a foreign nation declares,  
or openly and avowedly makes war upon the  
United States, they are then, by the very 1  
£aß, already at war, and ary declaration on |  
the part of Congress is nugatory ; it is at |  
Jeaft unnecessary. This inference is clear in |  
principle, and has the fanétion of establish- |  
ed praftice. Itisclearin principle, because &#x27;  
it is felf-evident, that a declaration by one !  
- mpation against another, produces at once a |  
complete slate of war between both ; and |  
that no declaration on the other.fide can at ;  
all vary their relative situation ; and io prac- |  
ice it is well known, that nothing is more |  
_common, than when war is declared by one |  
_party, to prosecute mutual hoflilities, with- |  
out a declaration by the other, i  
The do@rine of the Meflage includes the |  
firange absurdity, that, without a declara-!  
tion of war by Congress, our public force  
‘may destroy the life, but may not restrain;  
the liberty, or seize the property, of an en-;  
_emy. This was exemplified in the very in-!  
flance of the Tripolitan corsair. A num­  
_ber of her crew were slaughtered in the com­  
‘bat, and after she ,vzss subdued she was set  
‘sree with the remainder. But it may per­  
haps be said, that she was the assailant, and  
that resistance was an a&amp;t of mere defence,  
and felf prelervation. ~Let us then pursue  
the matter a fep further. Qur ships had  
.blockaded the Tripolitan Admiral in the bay  
_of Gibraltar ; fuppole, he had. artempted to  
*_make his way out, without firfk firing upon  
ghem : if permitted to do it;, the blockade

Let us suppose an invasion of our territo­  
ry, previous to a declaration of war by Con­  
gre&#x27;s. &#x27;Phe principle avowed in the mes­  
sage would authorize our troops to kill thole  
of the iavader, if they should come within  
the reach of their bayonets, perhaps to drive  
izto the sea and di”éﬁd”thﬂ!ﬁ‘;ﬂgx‘i not to  
idifable ‘hem from doing harm, bv the mild­  
le: proce/s 8f making them Jorifane:s, and  
wfending them into confineg®nt. Perhaps it  
‘tna;y be replied, that the fathe end would be  
#afwercd by difarming’and Izaving them to  
*ﬁﬁré_e. The merit of such an argument  
would be complete by adding, that should  
they not be famifhed, before the arrival of  
their ships, with a frefh supply of arms, we  
might then,. if able, disarm tgem a second  
time, and {end them on board their fleet, to  
return fafely home,  
The. inconvenience of the doftrine in  
praflice, is not less palpable than its folly in  
theory. In every case it prevents a moit  
uncqual warfare. In the instance which has  
occurred, the vanquished Barbarian got off  
with the loss of his guns, Had he been vic­  
torious, the Americans, whose lives might  
have been {pared, would have been doomed  
to wear out a miserable existence in slavery  
and chains. Substantial benefits would have  
rewarded his success ; while on our fide, life,  
liberty and property, were put in jeopardy  
for an empty triumph. &#x27; This, however,  
was a partial inconvenienceé—cales may a­  
rise in which evils of a more serious and  
comprehensive nature would be the fruits of  
this visionary and fantaftic principle.—Sup­  
pose that, in the recels of Congrefls, a fo­  
reign maritime power should unexpeliedly  
declare war against the United States, and  
fend a fleet and army to seize Rhode-I{land,  
in order from thence to annoy our trade and  
our sea port towns. °Till the Congress  
should aflemble and declare war, which |  
would require time, our ships might, accord­  
ing to the hypothesis of the Message, be sent  
by the President to fight those of the enemy  
as often as they should be attacked, bot not  
to capture and deiain them : If beaten, both  
veflels ‘and crews would be loft 1o the Uni­  
ted Srates :If fucceflsful, they could only |  
disarm those they had overcome, and mué !

INSTEAD of dclivtting a fpctcb to the Houfc of Con­  
grrl*, at the opening of the prelcnt fcl&amp;ou, the Prefi*  
dent ha* thought tn to tranfmit a Mtffagt. Whether  
this h i* proceeded from pride or from hum lity, from a  
temperate love of reform,or from a w ild fpirit of innova­  
tion, i* fubmiued to the conjectures of the curious. A  
fmgle obfervation fhali be indulged—fince all agree that  
he is unl.ke his predecciTor* in cflerttial point*, it i« a  
mark of confidency tc differ from them in matters of  
form.  
Whoever confuier* the temper of the day mudibe  
fati*fie.i that this meffage i» lik.ly to ada much to the  
popularity of our chief magidrate. It conforms as far  
as would be tolerated at thi* early dage of our progrels  
in pnlitKa1 perfection, to the bewitching tenet* of that  
illuminated doctrine, which promife* man, ere long,  
emancipation from ihe burdtnc and redraint* of govern­  
ment ; giving a fo&#x27;ttafte of that pure felicity which ihe  
apolHes of this dotSkrinc have predicted. After having,  
with infinite pains and afliduity, formed the public  
tadc for (hisfpecic* of fare, it is certainly right for thofe  
whom he people have cbofen for their caterers, to be  
attentive to the gratification of that lade. And fl» *uld  
the viands, which they may offer, prove baneful poi,  
fou* indead of whclefome alrncrits, the judific.itiou i*  
both pi*at and cafy—GooJ patriots mujl.at alt events, p&#x27;tafe

school, wuo amcr to wiaciy irom »ne hiiciptes o* the  
new creed, that they would rather rifle incurring the  
difpleafurc of the people, by (peaking unpayable truths,  
than betray their intereft by fofterin* the r prejudices ;  
will never be deterred by au impure tide of popular o­  
pinion. from honcftly pointing out the miftake; or the  
faults of weak or wicked men. who may have been fe­  
lcctcd as guardians of the public weal.  
The Mefl&#x27;age of the Prefident, by whatever motives  
it may h*ve been didtated, is a performance which  
ought to alarm ail who arc anxious for the fafety of  
our government, for the refpe&amp;ability and welfare of  
our nation- It makes, or aims at making, a moft prod­  
igal factifice of conftirutional energy, of found principle,  
*ni of public intereft, to the popularity of one man.  
The Srft thing in it wh eta excites our i&#x27;urprife, is the  
very extraordinary poGtion, that though Tripoli bad de­  
fined war inform againft the United .State . and had en­  
forced it by adlual hoftibty, yet that there was not  
power, for want of the fanfiion of Congreftt to capture and  
detain her cruiters with their crews.  
When the ncwfpapci s informed us, that one ofthefe  
eruifers,after being fubdued in a bloody conflict, had  
l ten liberated and permitted qu^ily to return home,  
the imagination was perplexed ,o divine the rcafon- —  
The c&lt; tije&amp;ure natural y was, that purfuinga policy,  
too refined perhaps for barbarian*, it was intended by  
that mcafure 10 give the enemy a ftrong impreflio* of  
our magnanimity and humanity. No one dreampt of  
A fctuplc as to the right to feiz; and detaio the armed  
veffcl of an open and avowed foe, v*nqui(h.*d in battle.  
The enigma is now folved, aud we are p-. looted with  
one of the moft lingular paradoxes ever advanced by a  
man claiming the character of a ftatefmaa. When an­  
alyzed, it amount* to nothing lefs than this, that between  
two naicns •here may exift a hate of complete war on  
the one Gi*e—of peace on the other.  
V\ ar, ol ii felf,gives to the parties a r.u ual right to kill  
in bat Jc and to capture the perfsns and property of  
each other. 1 his is a rule of na’urai law; a nccctTary &amp;■  
is ru&#x27;eof natural |a«- • a nccelfary and inevitable con­  
formable cooft^uct * the (Utc of war. This date be­  
  
tween nations is complete1} produced by the a&amp; of  
one—it requires no concurrent aft of the pther. It is im­  
polhblc to conceive, that one nation can hr in full war  
with another, and thia other not in the fame date with  
ri fpeft *o its adverfary The moment thertfore that  
two nations are, in an ablblute fenfe, at war, the public  
force of each may exercife every aft of hodility, which  
the gene, a! law* f war authorife, againd the perfons  
andpropeity of the other. As it refpefts this conclu­  
iion. the d dinftiou b.tween ofTcnfive and defenfivc:  
• war, makes «od ffercnce. Thai diltinftion h only ma­  
terial to difcriminatc the aggrading nation from that  
which defends itfeif againfl a’tack. The war is offen­  
five on the part of the date which makes it ; on the  
oppoGte fide it b defenfivc : bur the rights of both, as  
to the meafurc of hoftility, are equal.  
It will be readi y allowed that the Conflitution of a  
paiticular couivry may limit the Organ charged with I  
the d.reft&#x27;on of the public force, in the ufe or applica- 1  
tion of that force, even in time of aftual war; but 1  
rot hi i g fln»rt of the flrougefl negative words, of the  
mod expref* prohibitions, can be admitted to relirain  
that Organ from fo employing it as to derive the fruits  
of aftual victory, by making prifonefs of the perfons  
ana detaining the property of a vanquished euemy.  
Our Conflituti &gt;n happily, is not chargeable with fo  
great an abfurdity The framers of it would have  
biufhed at a p ovifion fo repugnant to gflf.d fenfe. fo  
inconfident with national lafety and inconvenience :  
That indrument has on’y provided affirmatively, that.  
“ The Congref* (hall have power to declare War , ’  
the pla n meaning of which is that, it is the peculiar  
and cxclufive province of Cong&lt;ef«, nvienthe na Un it mt  
peace, tothangtf that date into a itac u( war; whether  
from calculations of policy or from provocation* or in­  
jur c» received .• in other words, it be ongs to Congrefs  
only to goto Wat.—But when a foreign nation declares,  
or open y and avowedly make&lt; war upon the United I  
States, they are then by the very faft, al cady «/ w r  
and any dec&#x27;aration on the part of Congre s is nuga­  
tory ; it is at lead unnccefiary This inference i* clear |  
in principle, and has the fanftion of eflablithcd prac­  
tice. It is clear in principle, becaufc it is felf evident,  
that a declaration by one nation againd a no her, pro­  
duces at once a complete date ot war between both ,  
and that no declaration ou .he other fi-fe can at all va  
ry their relative lituation : and in pr*ftice it is weil  
known, that nothing is more common than when war  
is declared bv one party, to profccute mutual hodilities,  
  
wunuui a declaration oy tnc other.  
The doftrine of the Mcflage includes the ftrange  
l abluuiity, that without a sleclaratii a of war bv i  
Congrrft, our public force may deilroy the life,  
but tray not rettrain the liberty, or feize ihe pro­  
perty of an enemy. This was exemplified in the  
V.ry inftancc of the Trip ditan cor fair. A number  
of her crew v ere flaught&#x27;red in the combat, and  
after (he was fubdu-d flit was fer free with the re  
ntamder. But it may perhap- be laid, that Ihe was  
the a.fa’lant, and that refinance was an aft of  
mere defence, and (elf pretervation, Let us then  
puifuc the matter a ftep further. Our fhips had  
bu^-kaded the Tripolitan Admiral in the bay o(  
Gibraltar ; fuppofe, he had attempted to make hi*  
way out, without firft firing upon them : if per­  
muted to do it, the blockade was a farce; if hin­  
dered by force, this would ha7e amounted to more  
than a mere aft of defence; and if a com tat bad  
ciifutd, we fhould then have feen an unequlvoc  
ijluftration of the unintelligible right, to rake ih?  
I&#x27;ftr but nor to abridge the liberty, or capture »he  
property of an enemy.  
Let us fuppofe an invafion of our territory, p. e­  
viou. to a declara&#x27;ion of war by CuinereL.* The  
principle avowed ia the mcflage would author ze  
«ur 11 oops to k II thofe of the invader,if they fliould  
come within the reach of their oayonets, perhaps  
to drive them into the fea, and drown th m ; but  
not to difabie them from doing harm,by the milder  
procefa of making them p.if&gt;ners, and fending  
them into confinement Perhaps it may be rep&#x27;iea  
that the fame end would be anfwercd by dif.trnung  
and leaving them to flarvc. The merit of fuch an  
argument would be complete by adding,thar fhould ]  
’hey not be tamifticd, befo e the arrival of their  
flup-., with a freih fupply of arms we mi*ht then,  
if aWr, dil&#x27;arm them a kcjfid time, aaft lend them  
on board their fleet, to reiutu Ukly home.  
The inconvenience of the doftrinein praftice, is  
cot lefs palpable than its fotly in theory. In ev-ry  
cafe it prefects a moft unequal vzarfare In thv  
inftancc which baa occurred, the va lquifhed Bar  
bar.an got off with «he lofa of his guna. Had he  
been victorious, the Americans, wbofe J.ve* might  
have been fpared.would nave been doomed to wear  
out a mifcrable exiftence in flavery and chains.  
Stibllantial benefits would have rewarded his fuc­  
ce!* ; while on our fide, life, lioerty and ptoperty,  
were put in jeopardy, for au empty triumph. This,  
however, was a partial inconvenience—c ifes may  
anfr in which evils of a more serious and ccmpre­  
hrnlivc nature wouh. be the fruit3 of this viliouary  
and fantailical principle.— Soppofe that, in there  
ccfs of Congrds, a foreign maratime power ihot.id  
unexpectedly declare war againft the United States,  
and knd a fleet and army to feiz- Rhode-ifl-md, in  
eder from inrnce to annoy oik trade and our fea  
port towns. Till the Cotigrefe ihould aflfemble and  
declare war, which would require time, our (b p;  
mi&#x27;»ht according to the hypothetic of the Mcflage,  
be fens by the ?rcfident to fight thofe of the ene­  
my as often as they ftiould be attacked, but not to  
capture and detain them: It beaten, both vcfTels  
and crews would be loft to the United States : if  
fuccefsful, they could only difarm thofe they had  
overcome, and mult fuffer thi&#x27;m to return to the  
place of common rendezvous, thereto equip anew,  
for the purpr.ft of refuming tbeic^lepredations on  
our towns and our trade.  
Who could rettrain the laugh of derifion at pofi­  
tior.s fo prejrofterous, were it not for the refleftion  
that in the fiiff magiftrate of out country, they caft  
a blrmifli on our national charafter ? What will
