The Committee of 5. met, no such thing as a subcommittee was proposed, but they unanimously pressed on myself alone to undertake the draught. I consented; I drew it; but before I reported it to the committee, I communicated it separately to Dr. Franklin and mr. Adams requesting their corrections; because they were the two members of whose judgments and amendments I wished most to have the benefit before presenting it to  
  
the Committee; and you have seen the original paper now in my hands, with the corrections of Doctor Franklin and mr. Adams interlined in their own hand writings. Their alterations were two or three only, and merely verbal. I then wrote a fair copy, reported it to the Committee, and from them, unaltered to Congress. This personal communication and consultation with mr. Adams he has misremembered into the actings of a subcommittee. Pickering’s observations, and mr. Adams’s in addition, “that it contained no new ideas, that it is a commonplace compilation, it’s sentiments hacknied in Congress for two years before, and it’s essence contained in Otis’s pamphlet,” may all be true. Of that I am not to be the judge. Richd. H. Lee charged it as copied from Locke’s treatise on government. Otis’s pamphlet I never saw, &amp; whether I had gathered my ideas from reading or reflection I do not know. I know only that I turned to neither book or pamphlet while writing it. I did not consider it as any part of my charge to invent new ideas altogether &amp; to offer no sentiment which had ever been expressed before. Had mr. Adams been so restrained, Congress would have lost the benefit of his bold and impressive advocations of the rights of revolution. For n

Yet, on the same ground, we may ask what of these elevated thoughts was new, or can be affirmed never before to have entered the conceptions of man? Whether also the sentiments of independance, and the reasons for declaring it which make so great a portion of the instrument had been hacknied in Congress for two years before the 4th. of July 76. or this dictum also of mr. Adams be another slip of memory, let history say. This however I will say for mr. Adams, that he supported the declaration with zeal &amp; ability, fighting fearlessly for every word of it. A

me alone to undertake the draft myself;  
I consented; I drew it; but, before I re-

Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams interlined

ed it to the Committee, and from them,  
unaltered, to Congress.”

ferson tells us that his sensitiveness, as  
he ‘‘writhed” under the alteration of his
