n days past, and are just arrived at the Grounds we occupied before the Action of the 4th. One motive for coming here, is to divert the Enemy’s attention and force from the Forts. These they seem to consider as Capital objects, and from their operations mean to reduce if possible. At present their designs are directed against Fort Mifflin &amp; the Chivaux de frize. I have therefore detached a further Reinforcement to the Garrison.  
I yesterday, through the hands of Mrs Ferguson of Graham park, received a Letter of a very curious and extraordinary nature from Mr Duche, which I have thought proper to transmit to Congress. To this ridiculous—illiberal performance, I made a short reply, by desiring the bearer of it, if she should hereafter by any accident meet with Mr Duche, to tell him, I should have returned it unopened, If I had had any idea of the contents; observing at the same time, that I highly disapproved the intercourse she seemed to have been carrying on, and expected it would be discontinued. Notwithstanding the Author’s assertion, I cannot but suspect, that the measure did not originate with him, and that he was induced to it by the hope of establishing his interest and peace more effectually with the Enemy.
