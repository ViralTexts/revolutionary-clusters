[am now enabled to transmit  
to you a copy of Mr. Canning’s  
answer, received only last night,  
to my note of the 23d of August.  
  
This answer was accompanied  
by a letter, of which also a copy  
is enclosed, recapitulating what  
  
Mr. Canning supposes to be “ the  
substance of what has passed be-  
tween us at our several interviews  
previous to the presentation of  
my efficial letter.”  
  
- To the accompanying paper I  
think it indispensible that F should  
reply without delay—Supporting  
with politeness, but with firmness,  
the statements, which | have al-  
ready had the honor to make to  
you, of the conversations in ques-  
tion, and correcting some errors  
upon points, which Mr. Canning  
has thought fit to introduce into  
his letter, but which I had not  
supposed it necessary to mention  
in detail in my dispatches.  
  
I shall not detain Mr. Atwater  
with a view to this reply; but will  
take care to forward a copy of it  
by an early conveyance. My offi-  
cial note and the answer to it be-  
ing perfectly explicit, Mr. Can-  
ning’s misapprehensions (for such  
they are) of previous verbal com-  
munications can scarcely be very  
important in a public view; but  
it is, nevertheless, of some con-  
sequence, that, whatever may be  
the object of his statement, I  
should not make myself a party  
to its inaccuracies, by even a tacit  
admission of them.  
  
I do not perceive that a formal  
reply to the more official paper  
can now be of any advantage ; but  
I shall probably take occasion to  
combine with my reply to the one  
paper some observations upon the  
other.  
  
I regret extremely that the  
views which I have been instruct-  
ed to lay before this government  
have not been met by it as I had  
at first been led to expect. The  
overture cannot fail, however, to

Sra I ani now enabled to transmit to you a copy  
  
tf Mr. Canning&#x27;s answer, received only last night,  
to my note of the 23d of August.  
This answer was accompanied by aletter of which  
also a copy is enclosed, recapitulating what Mr. Can­  
ning supposes to be 44 the , substance of what has  
passed between us at our several interviews, previ­  
ous to the presentation of my official letter.&quot; ,  
To the accompanying paper I think it indispensi­

with politeness, but dth firmness, the statements  
which L have already had the honour to make to  
you, of the conversations in question, and correcting

thought fit to introduce into his letter, but which I  
had not (Supposed it necessary to mention in detail

I shall not detain Mr. Atwater with a view to this  
  
reply ; but will take care to forward a copy of it by  
an early conveyance. My official note and the an­  
swer to it being perfectly explicit, Mr. Canning&#x27;s  
misapprehensions (for such they are) of previous  
verbal communications can scarcely be very impor­  
tant in a public view ; but it is, nevertheless, of some  
consequence that, whatever may be the object of  
his statement, I should not make myself a party to  
its inaccuracies, by even a tacit admission of them.  
I do not perceive that a formal reply to the more  
official paper can now be of any advantage ; but I  
shall probably take occasion to combine with my re­  
ply to the one paper some observations upon the  
other.  
I regret extremely that the views which I have  
  
been instructed to lay before this government, have  
not been met by it as I had at first been led to ex­  
pect. The overture cannot fail, however, to place  
in a strong light the just and liberal sentiments by  
which our government is animated, and in other  
respects to be useful and honourable to our country.  
I have the honour to be,
