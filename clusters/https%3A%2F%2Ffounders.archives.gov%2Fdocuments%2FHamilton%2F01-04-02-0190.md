To the People of the State of New-York.  
The residue of the argument against the provisions in the constitution, in respect to taxation, is ingrafted upon the following clauses; the last clause of the eighth section of the first article of the plan under consideration, authorises the national legislature “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper, for carrying into execution the powers by that Constitution vested in the government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof;” and the second clause of the sixth article declares, that “the Constitution and the Laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, and the treaties made by their authority shall be the supreme law of the land; any thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.”  
These two clauses have been the sources of much virulent invective and petulant declamation against the proposed constitution, they have been held up to the people, in all the exaggerated colours of misrepresentation, as the pernicious engines by which their local governments were to be destroyed and their liberties exterminated—as the hideous monster whose devouring jaws would spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane; and yet strange as it may appear, after all this clamour, to those who may not have happened to contemplate them in the same light, it may be affirmed with perfect confidence, that the constitutional operation of the intended government would be precisely the same, if these clauses were entirely obliterated, as if they were repeated in every article. They are only declaratory of a truth, which would have resulted by necessary and unavoidable implication from the very act of constituting a Fœderal Government, and vesting it with certain specified powers. This is so clear a proposition, that moderation itself can scarcely listen to the railings which have been so copiously vented against this part of the plan, without emotions that disturb its equanimity.  
What is a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing? What is the ability to do a thing but the power of employing the means necessary to its execution? What is a LEGISLATIVE power but a power of making LAWS? What are the means to execute a LEGISLATIVE power but LAWS? What is the power of laying and collecting taxes but a legislative power, or a power of making laws, to lay and collect taxes? What are the proper means of executing such a power but necessary and proper laws?  
This simple train of enquiry furnishes us at once with a test by which to judge of the true nature of the clause c

y to the power of taxation, because it is the immediate subject under consideration, and because it is the most important of the authorities proposed to be conferred upon the Union. But the same process will lead to the same result in relation to all other powers declared in the constitution. And it is expressly to execute these powers, that the sweeping clause, as it has been affectedly called, authorises the national legislature to pass all necessary and proper laws. If there is any thing exceptionable, it must be sought for in the specific powers, upon which this general declaration is predicated. The declaration itself, though it may be chargeable with tautology or redundancy, is at least perfectly harmless.  
But SUSPICION may ask why then was it introduced? The answer is, that it could only have been done for greater caution, and to guard against all cavilling refinements in those who might hereafter feel a disposition to curtail and evade the legitimate authorities of the Union. The Convention probably foresaw what it has been a principal aim of these papers to inculcate that the danger which most threatens our political welfare, is, that the State Governments will finally sap the foundations of the Union; and might therefore think it necessary, in so cardinal a point, to leave nothing to construction.

osition to question the great and essential truth which it is manifestly the object of that provision to declare.  
But it may be again asked, who is to judge of the necessity and propriety of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the Union? I answer first that this question arises as well and as fully upon the simple grant of those powers, as upon the declaratory clause: And I answer in the second place, that the national government, like every other, must judge in the first instance of the proper exercise of its powers; and its constituents in the last. If the Fœderal Government should overpass the just bounds of its authority, and make a tyrannical use of its powers; the people whose creature it is must appeal to the standard they have formed, and take such measures to redress the injury done to the constitution, as the exigency may suggest and prudence justify. The propriety of a law in a constitutional light, must always be determined by the nature of the powers upon which it is founded. Suppose by some forced constructions of its authority (which indeed cannot easily be imagined) the Fœderal Legislature should attempt to vary the law of descent in any State; would it not be evident that in making such an attempt it had exceeded its jurisdiction and infringed upon that of the State? Suppose again that upon the pretence of an interference with its revenues, it should undertake to abrogate a land tax imposed by the authority of a State, would it not be equally evident that this was an invasion of that concurrent jurisdiction in respect to this species of tax which its constitution plainly supposes to exist in the State governments? If there ever should be a doubt on this head the credit of it will be intirely due to those reasoners, who, in the imprudent zeal of their animosity to the plan of the Convention, have laboured to invelope it in a cloud calculated to obscure the plainest and simplest truths.  
But it is said, that the laws of the Union are to be the supreme law of the land. But what inference can be drawn from this or what would they amount to, if they were not to be supreme? It is evident they would amount to nothing. A LAW by the very meaning of the term includes supremacy. It is a rule which those to whom it is prescribed are bound to observe. This results from every political association. If individuals enter into a state of society the laws of that society must be the supreme regulator of their conduct. If a number of political societies enter into a larger political society, the laws which the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers entrusted to it by its constitution, must necessarily be supreme over those societies, and the individuals of whom they are composed. It would otherwise be a mere treaty, dependent on the good faith of the parties, and not a government; which is only another word for POLITICAL POWER AND SUPREMACY. But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the larger society which are not pursuant to its constitutional powers but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies will become the supreme law of the land. These will be merely acts of usurpation and will deserve to be treated as such. Hence we perceive that the clause which declares the supremacy of the laws of the Union, like the one we have just before considered, only declares a truth, which flows immediately and necessarily from the institution of a Fœderal Government. It will not, I presume, have escaped observation that it expressly confines this supremacy to laws made pursuant to the Constitution; which I mention merely as an instance of caution in the Convention; since that limitation would have been to be understood though it had not been expressed.  
Though a law therefore for laying a tax for the use of the United States would be supreme in its nature, and could not legally be opposed or controuled; yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of a State (unless upon imports and exports) would not be the supreme law of the land, but an usurpation of power not granted by the constitution. As far as an improper accumulation of taxes on the same object might tend to render the collection difficult or precarious, this would be a mutual inconvenience not arising from a superiority or defect of power on either side, but from an injudicious exercise of power by one or the other, in a manner equally disadvantageous to both. It is to be hoped and presumed however that mutual interest would dictate a concert in this respect which would avoid any material inconvenience. The inference from the whole is—that the individual States would, under the proposed constitution, retain an independent and uncontroulable authority to raise revenue to any extent of which they may stand in need by every kind of taxation except duties on imports and exports. It will be shewn in the next paper that this CONCURRENT JURISDICTION in the article of taxatio

## Plain Answers to Important Inquiries

States manifestly contemplates it; for it declares (article 6th), that this Con-  
stitution, and the laws, &amp;c. and treaties made under the authority of the Uni-  
ted States, ‘shall be the supreme Law of the land.’ This (as has been  
justly observed by the Federalist) results from the very nature of political  
institutions. A law, by the very meaning of the terms, includes supremacy.  
If individuals enter into a state of society, the laws of that society must be  
the supreme regulator of their conduct. If a number of political societies  
enter into a larger political society, the laws which the latter may enact,  
pursuant to the powers entrusted to it by its constitution, must be supreme  
over those societies, and the individuals of whom they are composed. It  
would otherwise be a mere treaty, dependant on the good faith of the par-  
ties, and not a government, which is only another word for political power and  
supremacy.”  
  
From a careful discussion of this subject, the Judge comes to  
this conclusion,  
  
«That a state constitution is no farther to be deeme:] a compact, than that  
it is a matter of consent by the people, binding them to obedience to its re-  
quisitions; and that its proper character is that of a fundamental law, pre-  
scribed by the will of the majority of the people of the state, (who are en-  
titled to prescribe it), for the government and regulation of the whole people

The author justifies this view of the case by reasoning and au-  
thority; and, at the same time, takes care to guard this power from  
too liberal an extension.  
  
The incorporation of a national bank is one of the incidental  
powers arising from the clause in the Constitution above quoted.  
However this power might have been. once questionable, it is now  
fixed and established, if any thing under the Constitution can be  
so, and the construction of that instrument is not to be forever

## [From _Southern standard._](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83016866/1851-12-27/ed-1/?sp=3)

every other, must jude, in the first instance, of  
tbe proper exercise of its. powers ; and its constit-  
Uents inthe last. If the federal government should  
overpass the just bounds of&#x27; its authority, and make  
a tyrannical use of its powers ; the people, whose  
creature it is, must appeal to the standard they  
have formed, and take such measures to redress  
f.ced construction of its authority (which indeed  
caunot easily be imagined) the federal legislature  
should attempt to vary the law of descent in any  
state ; would it not be evident, that in making  
such an attempt, it had exceeded its jurisdiction,  
and infringed upon that of the state ? Suppose,  
again, that upon the pretence of an interference  
i&quot;1 lts revenues, it should undertake to abrogate  
aland tax imposed by the authority of a state ;  
WOuld ll nf bc efluall7 evident, that this was an  
invasion of that concurrent jurisdiction in respect  
to this species of tax, which the constitution plain  
ly supposes to exist in the state Governments ? If  
there ever should be a doubt on this . head, the  
credit of it will be entirely due to those reasoners,  
who, in the imprudent zeal of their animosity to  
the plan of the convention, have laboured to en­  
velope it in a cloud, calculated to obscure the  
plainest and simplest truths.  
But it is said, that the laws of the union are to  
be the supreme I mo of the land. What inference  
can be drawn from this, or what would they amount  
to, if they were not to be supreme ? It is evident  
t.hcy -would &#x27;amount to nothing. A LAW, hy the  
very meaning of. the term, includes supremacy.  
It is a rule, which&quot; those to whom it is prescribed  
are bound to observe. This results from every po­  
litical association. If individuals enter into a state  
of society, the laws of that society, must be the  
supreme regulator of their conduct. If a number  
of political societies enter into a larger political so­  
ciety, the laws which the latter may enact, pursu­  
ant to the powers intrusted to it by its constitution,  
must necessarily be supreme over those societies,  
and the individuals of whom they are composed.  
It would otherwise be a mere treaty, dependent  
on the good faith of the parties, and not a gov­  
ernment ; which is only another Word for politi­  
cal POWER AND SUPREMACY.- But it Will hot fol-  
low from this doctrine, that acts of the larger so­  
ciety, which are not pursuant to its constitutional  
powers, but which are invasions of the residuary  
authorities of the smaller societies, Avill become  
the supreme law of the land. These will be mere­  
ly acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated  
as such. Hence we perceive, that the clause which  
declares the supremacy of the laws of the union,  
like the one we have just before considered, only  
declares a truth, which flows immediately and nec­  
essarily from the institution of a federal govern­  
ment. It will not, I presume have escaped ob­  
servation, that it expressly confines this suprema  
cy to laws made pursuant to the&#x27; constitution ;  
which I mention merely as an instance of caution  
in the convention ; since that limitation would  
have been to be understood, though it had not  
been expressed.&quot;  
The &quot;cokstituents&quot; of the government are  
then, the judges in the last resort. Was the Gov  
eminent of the United States constituted by the  
several States by the separate authority of the  
people of each State as forming so many inde­  
pendent States, or was-it constituted by the people  
of the United States as formini; one aggregate na  
tion. In other words, was the act establishing the  
constitution a Xational or a Federal act ? If the  
former, then the States have no powers reserved  
if the latter, then the people of the respective  
States being the constituents of the Government

So, too, Hamilton, in the thirty-third number of the Federalist,  
in noticing the class of objections made to the clause which  
gives to Congress the right to make all laws necessary and  
proper for carrying into execution the powers vested in the govern-  
ment, disclaims the conclusion that it affords any warrant for the  
exercise of other powers than those granted by the instrument.  
He says,—* It may be affirmed, with perfect confidence, that the  
constitutional operation of the intended government would be pre-  
cisely the same if these clauses were entirely obliterated, as if  
they were repeated in every article. They are only declaratory of  
a truth, which would have resulted by necessary and unavoidable  
implication from the very act of constituting a federal government

it has affectedly been called, has no other force than to authorize  
the execution of the powers previously expressed.”  
  
In addition to these clear contemporaneous expositions of the  
meaning of these clauses of the Constitution, it may not be im-  
proper to add an argument which seems te us conclusive of the  
point at issue. The articles of the confederation established the  
title of the confederacy as “ The United States of America.”

force this article by appropriate legis.­  
lation  The end of the fourteenth the  
same frame of words, and at the end  
of the fifteenth the same frame of  
words. Now what did Mr. Hamilton  
say on that subject? I read from the  
Federalist, page 203:  
&quot;The last clause of the eighth see  
tion of the first article of the plan un­  
der consideration authorizes the Na  
tional Legislature &#x27;to make all laws  
which shall be necessary and proper for  
carrying into execution the powers by  
that Constitution vested in the Gov­  
ernment of the United States, or in  
any department or officer thereof; and  
the second clause of the sixth article  
declares that the Constitution and the  
laws of the United States made in pur  
suance thereof, and the treaties made  
by their authority, shall be the su  
preme lawe of the land; anything in the  
constitution or laws of any State to  
the contrary notwithstanding&#x27;  
These two clauses have been the  
source of much virulent invective, and  
petulant declamation, against the Con­  
stitution. They have been held up to  
the people in all the exaggerated col  
ors of misrepresentation; as the per­  
nicious engines by which their local  
governments were to be destroyed,  
and their liberties exterminated; as  
the hideous monster whose devouring  
jaws would spare neither sex nor age,  
nor high nor low, nor sacred nor pro  
fane; and yet, strange as it may ap­  
pear, after all this clamor, to those  
who may not have happened to con  
template them in the same light, it  
may be affirmed with perfect conn  
dence that the Constitutional opera­  
tion of the intended government would  
be precisely the same, if these clauses  
were entirely obliterated, as if they  
were repeated in every article. They  
are only declaratory of a truth, which  
would have resulted by necessary and  
unavoidable implication from the very  
act of constituting a federal govern-  
ment, and vesting it with certain spe  
cified powers. This is so clear a prop  
bsition that moderation itself can  
searcely listen to the railings which  
have been so copiously vented against  
this part of the plan, without emo­  
tions that disturb its equanimity.&quot;

‘a legal but a political question, with which  
the court has no concern. The courts have  
always held, as this correspondent shows,  
that while they can pass upon the constitu-  
tionality of powers exercised by the Legis-  
lature, they can not decide upon the ex-  
istence of the necessity for exercising the  
power. That is a question for the Legisla-  
ture. If the legal power exists, the Legis-  
lature must decide for itself whether the  
occasion for its exercise has arisen. This  
doctrine was declared by Chief Justice  
MARSHALL, and Mr. Justice SToRY says, ex-  
pressly : “The national government, like ev-  
ery other, mast judge in the first instance  
of the proper exercise of its powers, and its
