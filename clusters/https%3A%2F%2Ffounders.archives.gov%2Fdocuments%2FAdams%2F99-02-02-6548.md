Revnd. Dr Morse  
Quincy December 2nd 1815  
  
If I ever comply with your request, I must make haste, &amp; employ the few intervals of light which my eyes afford me. Where is the man to be found, at this day, when we see Methodistical Bishops, Bishops of the Church of England, &amp; Bishops, Archbishops, &amp; Jesuits of the Church of Rome, with indifference; who will beleive, that the apprehension of Episcopacy, contributed 50 years ago, as much as any other cause, to arouse the attention, not only of the enquiring mind but of the common people? And urge them to close thinking on the Constitutional Authority of Parliament over the Colonies? This nevertheless, was a fact, as certain as any in the history of North America.  
The object was not merely to the office of a Bishop though even that was dreaded, as to the Authority of Parliament, on which it must be founded. The reasoning was this. the Archbishops, and Bishops in England, can neither locate &amp; limit Dioceses in America, nor ordain Bishops in any part of the dominions of Great Britain, out of the realm; by any law of the Kingdom or any of the Colonies, nor by any Cannon law acknowledged by either. The King cannot grant his Congé d’elire to any people out of his realm. There is no power or pretended power, less than Parliament, that can create Bishops in America. But if Parliament can erect Diocesses &amp; appoint Bishops, they may introduce the whole Hierarchy, establish Tithes, forbid marriages &amp; funerals, establish religions, forbid Dissenters, make Schism Heresy, impose penalties, extending to life and limb, as well as to liberty &amp; property   
Here, Sir, opens an extensive field of investigation, even for a young historian who might be disposed to undertake so laborious an enterprize.  
The opinion, the principles, the spirit, the temper, the views, disigns, Intrigues, and arbitrary exertions of power, displayed by the Church of England, at that time towards the Dissenters, as they were, contemptuously called, though in reality the Churchmen, were the real dissenters; this ought to be stated, at full length. The truth is that the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, the Anabaptists, the Methodists, or even the Quakers, or Moravians, were each of them as numerous as the Churchmen; Several of them immensely more numerous; and all of them together, more than fifteen to one.  
In Virginia the Church of England, was established by law, in exclusion, &amp; without toleration of any other denomination; The British Statute called, The Act of Uniformity, was acknowledged, as law &amp; carried into Execution, by the Magistrates; It is worthy of enquiry, whether the same law, was not in force, in Maryland the Carolinas and Georgia. In Pensylvania, the Quakers, the Presbyterians, the German Lutherans, &amp; Calvanists, the Anabaptists, the Methodists the Dunkers, the Marianists and the Roman Catholicks were so numerous &amp; the Church of England so few that the latter found it difficult to support their cause, &amp; the ridiculous Incarnations, &amp; Tergiversations of the Proteus, Dr Smith, &amp; that other weaker Proteus, Du Shu &amp; the Bigotry of Covents, shewed their awkward struggles, to preserve their cause from Contempt. White, now Bishop, then young, behaved with uniform candour, moderation and decorum.  
In new York the Church of England, displayed its essential character of Intolerance. The royal Governors, Counsellors, Judges &amp;c had such overbearing influence, that they dared to grant, large tracts of fertile lands, to the Churches of England, and laid the foundation of the ample riches they still hold, which no other denomination could obtain any. Even Dr Rogers’ Congregation, numerous, &amp; respectable as it was, could never obtain a legal title to a spot to bury their dead. The writings of Livingston &amp; Smith, furnish evidence enough, of the spirit of these times. Great exertions were made in New England York, to propogate Anglican Episcopacy in Connecticutt, &amp; a famous Dr Cutler, and a more famous Dr Johnson, &amp; his still more celebrated Son, were employed with success in that service. With such success, indeed, that an English Church, and an Episcopal Priest, now appeared in all the towns from New Haven, to New York. The efforts in New Hampshire &amp; Rhode Island, though they ought to be recorded, I pass over, and hasten to Massachusetts. And here I want to write a volume; Here the Clergy, and principle Gentlemen among the Laity, were high Churchmen, indeed; Passive obedience, and non resistance, in the most unqualified and unlimited sense, were their avowed principles in Government, and the power of the Church, to decree Rites and Ceremonies, and the authority of the Church, in Controversies of faith, were explicitly avowed. I know not where to begin, nor where to end. The Anecdotes, which I could relate, as an eye, &amp; an ear witness would be innumerable. This North Precinct of the large, and Ancient town of Braintree, now called Quincy, in which I was born, and bred and in which my Father, Grand Father, Great Grand Father, &amp; Great, Great Grand Father, lived, died, and lay buried, was a very focus of Episcopal Bigotry, Intrigue, Intolerance and persecution. I could introduce here a Dramatis Personæ of names, which I will not now commit to paper, &amp; entertain you with plots, &amp; Intrigues,  which would compose a Comedy, equal to any of Moliere or Shakespeare, if corruption prostitution &amp; Dupery can compose a Comedy. leaving this for the present, we will proceed to Cambridge; Several branches of our Braintree family of Vassals, had removed, and planted themselves in the very front of the University, &amp; they must have an Episcopal Church. Our Braintree family of Apthorps, instantly turned their attention to that seat of muses and dissenters— Mr East Apthorp hot from Oxford, and still more warned by holy orders, from Episcopal hand, returned to his native Country; and soon after, arose a splendid Edifice, as it was then thought; which every body immediately concluded, was intended for an Episcopal Palace, &amp; in time for a Lambeth. All sensible men knew, that this system could not be effected, but by act of Parliament. And if Parliament could do this, they could do all things; and what security could Americans have, for life, Liberty, property or religion?  
The society for propagating the gospel, had long perverted their Revenues, from their original design to the support of the Church of England Ministers. Upon the death of Dr Miller of Braintree a satirical Irony appeared in a Newspaper, the point of which, turned upon this abuse, of the Societies resources. This Jeu d’Esprit soon produced an explosion. Mr Apthorp came out with an eloquent &amp; zealous pamphlet. Dr Mayhew appeared with his comparison, between the charter, and conduct of the society, shewing their non conformity with each other. The Controversy soon interested all men, spread through America, &amp; in Europe, brought forward the aged Dr Johnson, &amp; at last the Arch Bishop of Canterbury. All denominations in America became interested in it, &amp; began to think of the secret latent principle, upon which all encroachments upon us, must be founded, the power of parliament. The Nature and extent of the Authority of Parliament, over the colonies, was discussed every where, till it was discovered, that it had none at all; a conclusion, still more forcibly impressed upon the people by the Canada bill, by which the Roman Catholic religion, &amp; Popish Bishops, were established in that province by authority of a British Parliament. The people said, if Parliament can do this in Canada, they can do the same in all the other Colonies; &amp; they began to see, &amp; freely say, that Parliament had no authority over them, in any case whatsoever.

Quincy, December 2, 1815.  
Rev. Dr. Mons,  
  
If I ever comply with your request, I  
must make haste and employ the few in-  
tervals of light which my eyes afford me.  
  
Where is the man to be found at this  
day, when we see Methodistical bishops,  
bishops of the Church of England, and  
bishops, archbishops, and Jesuits of the  
Church of Rome, with indifference, who  
will believe that the apprehension of Epis-  
copacy contributed 50 years ago, as much  
as any other cause, to arouse the attention,  
not only of the inquiring mind, but of the  
common people, and urge them to close  
thinking on the constitutional authority of  
parliament over the colonies ? This never-  
theless was a fact, as certain as any in the  
history of North America.  
  
The objection was not merely to the of-  
fice of a bishop, though even that was  
dreaded, as the authority of parliament,  
on which it must be founded. The reason-

limit dioceses in America, nor ordain bi-  
shops in any part of the dominions of  
Great Britain, out of the realm, by any  
law of the kingdom, or of any of the colo-  
nies, nor by any canon law acknowledged  
by either. The king cannot grant his congé  
delire to any people out of his realm. There  
is no power, or pretended power, less than  
parliament, that can create bishops in Ame-  
rica. But if parliament can erect dioceses  
and appoint bishops, they may introduce  
the whole hierarchy, establish tithes, for-  
bid marriages and funerals, establish reli-  
gion, forbid dissenters, make schism he-  
resy, impose penalties extending to life  
and limb, as well as iberty and property.  
  
Here, Sir, opens an extensive field of in-  
vestigation, even fora young historian, who  
might be disposed to undertake so labori-  
ous an enterprise. The opinions, the prin-  
ciples, the spirit, the temper, the views,  
designs, intrigues, and arbitrary exertions  
of power, displayed by the Church of Eng-  
land at that time towards the dissenters, as  
they were contemptuously cailed, though,  
to speak correctly, the Churchmen were  
the real dissenters, ought to be stated at  
full length. The truth is, that the Congre-  
gationalists, the Presbyterians, the Ana-  
baptists, the Methodists, or even the Qua-  
kers or Moravians, were each of them as  
numerous as the Churchmen; several of  
them immensely more numerous, and all  
of them together, more than fifteen to one.  
  
In Virginia the Church of England was  
established by law, in exclusion and with-  
out toleration of any other denomination.  
The British statute, called The Act of  
Uniformity, was acknowledged as law,  
and carried into execution by the magis-  
trates. It is worthy of inquiry, whether  
the same law was not in force in Mary-  
land, the Carolinas, and Georgia. In Penn-  
sylvania, the Quakers, the Presbyterians,  
the German Lutherans and Calvinists, the  
Anabaptists, the Methodists, the Dunkers,  
the Menonists and Roman Catholics, were  
so numerous, and the Church of England  
so few, that the latter found it difficult to  
support their cause; and the ridiculous  
incurvations and tergiversations of the  
Proteus Dr. Smith, and that other weaker  
Proteus, Du Shee, and the bigotry of  
Coombs, showed their awkward struggles  
to preserve their cause from contempt.  
Dr. White, now bishop, then young, be-  
haved with uniform candour, moderation,  
and decorum.  
  
In New-York, the Church of England

June, 1825.] Remarks on “ Episcopacy, @ Cause of the Revolution.” 167  
  
Rogers’ congregation, of New-York, nu-  
merous and respectable as it was, could  
never obtain a legal title to a spot to bury  
their dead. The writings of Livingston  
and Smith furnish evidence enough of the  
spirit of those times. Great exertions were  
made in New-York to propagate Anglican  
Episcopacy in Connecticut; and the fa-  
mous Dr. Cutler, and the more famous Dn  
Johuson, and his stil more celebrated  
son, were employed with success in that  
service. With such success, indeed, that  
an English church and an Episcopal minis  
ster soon appeared in ali the towns from  
New-Haven to New-York.  
  
The efiorts in New-lHampshire and  
Rhode-Island, though they ought to be  
recorded, I pass over them, and hasten to  
Massachusetts ; and here 1 want to write  
a volume. Here the clergy, and principal  
gentlemen among the laity, were high  
Churchmen indeed. Passive obedience  
and non-resistance, in the most unquali-  
fied and unlimited sense, were their avowed  
principles in government; and the power  
of the Church to decree rites and cere-  
monies, and the authority of the Church  
in controversies of faith, were explicitly  
avowed. I know not where to begin, nor  
when to end. The anecdotes which I could  
relate, as an eye and an ear witness, would  
be innumerable. This north precinct of  
the large and ancient town of Braintree,  
now called Quincy, in which I was born  
and bred, and in which my father, grand-  
father, great-grandfather, and great-great-  
grandfather, lived, died, and lie buried,  
was a very focus of Episcopal bigotry,  
intrigue, intolerance, and persecution.  
could introduce here a dramatis persone  
of names, wiich I will not now commit  
to paper, and entertain you with plots and  
intrigues, which would compose a comedy,  
equal to any of Moliere or Shakespeare, if  
corruption, prostitution, and dupery can  
compose a comedy. Waving this for the  
present, we will proceed to Cambridge.  
Several branches of our Braintree family  
of Vassals had removed and planted them-  
selves in the very front of the university,  
and they must have an Episcopal church.  
Our Braintree family of Apthorps instante  
ly turned their attention to that seat of the  
muses and dissenters. Mr. East Apthorp,  
hot from Oxford, and still more warmed  
by holy orders from Episcopal hands, re-  
turned to his native country; and soon  
after arose a splendid edifice, as it was  
then thought, which every body immedi-  
ately concluded was intended for an Epis-  
copal palace, and in time for a Lambeth.  
All sensible men knew that this system  
could not be effected but by act of parlia-  
ment, and if parliament could dé this,  
they could do all things; and what secy-  
rity could Americans have for life, liberty,  
property, or religion ?

know not where to begin, nor when  
toend. The anecdotes which I could  
relate, as an eye and an ear witness,  
would be innumerable. This north  
precinct of the large and ancient town  
of Braintree, now called Quincy, in  
which I was born and bred, and in  
which my father, grandfather, great-  
  
ndfather and great-great-grandfa-  
  
r, lived, died, and lie buried, was a  
  
very focus of Episcopal bigotry, in-  
  
trigue, intolerance, and persecution.  
I could introduce here a dramatis  
persone of names, which I will not  
now commit to paper, and entertain  
you with plots and intrigues, which  
would compose a comedy, equal to  
any of Moliere or Sliakspeare, if  
corruption, prostitution, and dupery  
can. compose a comedy. Waving  
this for the present, we will proceed  
to Cambridge. Several branches of  
our Braintree family of Vassals had  
removed and planted themselves in  
the very front of the university, and  
they must have an Episcopal church.  
Our Braintree family of A in-  
stantly turned their attention to that  
seat of the muses and dissenters.  
Mr. East Apthorp, hot from Ox-  
ford, and still more warmed by  
holy orders from Episcopal hands,  
returned to his native country; and  
soon after arose a splendid edifice, as  
it was then thought, which every body  
immediately concluded was intended  
for an Episcopal palace, and in time  
for a Lambeth. All sensible men  
knew that this system could not be  
effected but by act of parliament, and  
if parliament could do this, they could  
do all things; and what security could  
Americans have for life, liberty, pro-  
perty, or religion? ‘  
he Society for Propagati e  
Gospel had long perverted their re-  
sources from iginal design, to the  
support of Church of E min-  
isters. Upon the death of Dr. Miller  
of Braintree, a satirical irony appear-  
ed in a newspaper, the point of which  
turned upon this abuse of the society’s  
resources. This jeud’esprit soon pro-  
  
duced an explosion. Mr. A  
  
came out with an eloquent and  
  
ous pamphlet. Dr. Mayhew appear-  
ed with his comparison between the  
charter and conduct of the society,  
showing their non-conformity with  
each other. The controversy soon  
interested all men, spread  
America and in Europe, brought for-  
ward the aged Dr. Johnson, and at  
last the archbishop of Canterbury.*

when we see Methodistical Bishops, Bishops of

North America.  
  
Phe objection was not merely to the office of  
i Bishop, though even that was dreaded, as to  
ie authority of Parliament, on which it must  
founded. The reasoning was this :—The  
Archbishops and Bishops in England can neither  
sate and limit dioceses in America, nor ordain  
Hishops in any part of the dominions of Great  
Britain, out of the realm, by any law of the  
ngdom, or of any law of the colonies, nor by

ple out of his realm. There is no power, or  
retended power, less than Parliament, that can  
  
create Bishops in America. But if Parliament  
  
can erect dioceses and appoint Bishops, they  
may introduce the whole hierarchy, establish  
tythes, forbid marriages and funerals, establish  
religion, forbid dissenters, make schism heresy,  
  
impose penalties extending to life and limb, as  
  
well as to liberty and property.  
Here, sir, opens an extensive field of investi-  
gation, even for a young historian, who might  
  
disposed to undertake so laborious an enter-  
ise. ‘The opinions, the principles, the spirit,  
&gt; temper, the views, designs, intrigues and ar-  
rary exertions of power, displayed by the  
C\urch of England at that time towards the

to speak correctly, the Churchmen were  
Dissenters—ought to be stated at full  
g Phe truth is, that the Congregational-  
sts, the Presbyterians, the Anabaptists, the  
Methodists, or even the Quakers or Moravians,  
were each of them as numerous as the Church-  
men ; several of them immensely more numer-

In Virginia, the Church of England was es-

eration of any other denomination, The British  
statute, called The Act of Uniformity, was ac-  
knowledged as law, and carried into execution  
by the magistrates. It is worthy of inquiry,  
whether the same law was not in force in Ma-  
  
ryland, the Carolinas, and Georgia. In Penn-  
  
sylvania, the Quakers, the Presbyterians, the  
  
German Lutherans, and Calvinists, the Ana-  
baptists, the Methodists, the Dunkers, Meno-  
nists and the Roman Catholics were so numer-

Quincy, Dec. 2, 1815.  
| Rev. Dr. Morse,—If lever comply with  
your request, [ must make haste and em-  
jploy the few intervals of light which my  
| eyes afford me.  
| Where is the man to be found, at this day,  
when we see Methodistical Bishops, Bish-  
ops of the Church of England, and Bishops,  
{Archbishops and Jesuits of the Church of  
| Rome with indifference, who will believe,  
jthat the apprehension of Episcopacy con-  
| tributed, filty years ago, as much as any  
jother cause, to arouse the attention, not  
only of the inquiring mind, but of the com-  
|mon people, and urge them to close think-  
|ing on the constitutional authority of Par-  
jliament over the colonies? ‘This, pever-  
| theless, was a fact as certain as any in the  
| history of North America.  
  
The objection was not merely to the  
office of a Bishop, though even that was  
dreaded, as to the authority of Parliament,  
on which it must be founded. The rea-  
soning was this:—The Archbishops and  
Bishops in England can neither locate and  
limit diocesses in America, nor ordain  
Bishops in any partof the dominions of  
Great Britain, out of the realm, by any law  
of the kingdom, or of any law of the colo-  
nies, nor by any canon law acknowledged  
by either. ‘The king cannot grant his  
conge d° elire to any people outof his realm.  
There is no power, or pretended power, less  
than Parliament, that can create Bishops  
in America, Butif Parliament can erect  
diocesses and appoint Bishops, they may  
introduce the whole hierarchy, establish  
itythes, forbid marriages and funerals, es-  
tablish religion, forbid dissenters, makes  
schism heresy, impose penalties extending  
to life and limb, as well as to liberty and  
property.  
  
llere, sir, opens an extensive field of in-  
vestigation, even for a young historian,  
|}who might be disposed to undertake so  
laborious an enterprise. The opinion, the  
the principles, the spirit, the temper, the  
views, designs, intrigues and arbitrary ex-  
ertions of power displayed by the Church  
of England at that time towards the Dis-  
senters, as they were contemptuously call-  
ed, though, to speak correctly, the church-  
men were the real Dissenters—ought to be  
staced at full length. The truth is, that the  
Congregativnalists, the Presbyterians, the  
Anabaptists, the Methodists, or even the  
| Quakers, or Moravians, were each of them  
as numerous as the churchmen; several of  
them immensely more numerous, and all of  
them together, more than fifteen to one.  
  
In Virginia, the Charch of England was  
established by law, in exclusion and with-  
out toleration of any other denomination.  
The British statute, called The Act of Uni-  
formity, was acknowledged as law, and car-  
ried into execution by the magistrates. It  
is worthy of inquiry, whether the same law  
was not in force in Maryland, the Caroli-  
nas, and Georgia. In Pennsylvania, the  
Quakers, the Presbyterians, the German  
Lutherans, and Calvinists, the Anabaptists  
the Methodists, the Dunkers, Menonists  
and the Roman Catholics were so numer-  
ous, and the Church of England so few,  
that the latter found it difficult to support  
their cause; and the ridiculous incurva-  
tions and tergiversations of the Proteus Dr.  
Smith, and that other weaker Proteus, Du  
| Shee, and the bigotry of Coombs, showed  
|their awkward struggles to preserve their  
leause from contempt. Dr. White, now  
| Bishop, then young, behaved with uniform  
candor, moderation and decorum,  
  
In New York, the Church of England  
| displayed its essential character of intoler-  
ance. The royal governors, counsellors,  
judges, &amp;c., had such overbearing influ-  
ence, that they dared to grant large tracts  
of fertile lands to the churches of England,  
and laid the foundation of the ample riches  
| they still hold; while no other denomina-  
ltion could obtain any. Even Doctor Ro-  
gers’s congregation, of New York, numer-  
ous and respectable as it was, could never  
obtain a legal title to a spet to bury their  
dead. ‘The writings of Livingston and  
Smith furnishes* evidence enough of the  
spirit of those times. Great exertions were  
made in New York to propagate Anglican  
Episcopacy in Connecticut; and the fa-  
mous Dr. Cutler, and the more famous Dr.  
Johnson, and his still more celebrated son,  
were employed with success in that service.  
With such success, indeed, that an English,  
church and an Episcopal minister soon ap-  
peared in all the towns from New Haven to  
New York.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The efforts in New Hampshire and Rhode |  
Island, though they ought to be recorded, I }  
pass over, and hasten to Massachusetts ; and  
here [ want to write a volume. Here the  
clergy and principal gentlemen among the  
laity, were high churchmen indeed. Pas-  
sive obedience and non-resistance in the  
most unqualified and unlimited sense, were  
their principles in government, and the  
power of the church in controversies of  
faith, were explicitly avowed. 1 know not  
where to begin, nor when to end. The  
anecdotes which I could relate, as an eve  
and an ear witness, would be intiumerable.  
This north precinct of the large and ancient  
town of Braintree, now called Quincy, in  
which I was born and bred; and in which  
my father, grand-father, great grand-father, |  
and great-great-grand-father lived, died, and |  
lie buried, was a very focus of Episcopacy,  
bigotry, intrigue, intolerance and persecu-  
tion. I could introduce here a dramatjs  
persona of names, which I will now commit  
to paper, and entertain you with plots and  
intrigues, which would compose a comedy,  
equal to any of Moliere or Shakspeare, if  
corruption, prostitution and dupery can  
compose a comedy. Waiving this for the  
present, we will proceed to Cambridge:—  
Several branches of our Braintree family of  
vassals had removed and planted themselves  
in the very front of the University, and they  
must have an Episcopal church, Our  
Braintree family of Apthorps instantly turn-  
ed their attention to that seat of the muses  
and dissenters. Mr. East Apthorp, hot from  
Oxford, and still more warmed by holy  
orders from Episcopal hands, returned to  
his native country ; and soon after arose a  
splendid edifice, as it was then thought,  
which every body immediately concluded  
was intended for an Episcopal palace, and  
lin time fora Lambeth. All sensible men  
| knew that this system could not be effected,  
but by act of Parliament, and if Parliament  
| could do this they could doall things; and  
| what security could Americans have for life,  
|liberty, property, or religion?

had long perverted their resources from  
itheir original desigu, to the support of the  
Church of England ministers. Upon the  
death of Dr. Miller, of Braintree, a satirical  
irony appeared in a newspaper, the point of  
which turned upon this abuse of the so-  
ciety’s resources. ‘This jeu d’ esprit soon  
produced au explosion. Mr. Apthorp came  
out with an eloquent and zealous pamphlet.  
Dr. Mayhew appeared with his comparison  
between the charter and conduct of the  
society, shewing their non-couformity with  
each other, The controversy soon inter-  
ested all men, spread through America and  
in Europe, brought forward the aged Dr.  
Johnson, and at last the Archbishop of Can-  
terbury. All denoiminations in America  
became interested in it, and began to think  
of the secret, latent principle upon which  
all encroachments opon us must be founded,  
the power of Parliament. ‘The nature and  
extent of the authority of Parliament over  
the colonies was discussed everywhere, till  
it was discovered that it had none at all: a  
conclusion still more forcibly impressed  
upon the people by the Canada Bill, by  
which the Roman Catholic religion and  
Popish Bishops were established in that  
province, by authority of a British Parlia-  
ment. The people said, if Parliament can  
do this in Canada, they can do the same in  
all the other colonies: and they began to  
see, and freely to say, that Parliament had  
no authority over them in auy case whatso-  
ever. Joun Apams
