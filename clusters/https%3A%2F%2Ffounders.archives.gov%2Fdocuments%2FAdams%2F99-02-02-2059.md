And it is also declared by this act, that at the expiration of three  
years next ensuing the time when the coinage of gold and silver,  
agreeably to the act establishing the mint, shall commence at the  
mint of the United States; all foreign gold coin and all foreign  
silver coin, except Spanish milled dollars, and parts of such dollars,  
shall cease to be a legal tender. And it would be incongruous to  
suppose that; if these foreign coins, if not a legal tender, would be

act, in order to fix the time when foreign coin should cease to be a  
tender, that the president shall make proclamation of the time when  
such coinage shall commence. The president, accordingly, on the  
22d of July 1797, issued his proclamation, announcing the time  
when the coinage commenced at the mint, and declaring that all  
foreign silver, except Spanish milled dollars and parts of such dollars,  
will cease to pass current as money on the 15th of October then next.
