WASHiNGTON, Feb, 16,--I ran across  
an interesting manuscript in the State  
department the other day, which was none  
other than the report of the committee  
appointed July 4, 1776, &quot;To prepare a  
seal for the United States of America  
The persons composing the committee  
were Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, and Mr  
Jefferson. It has generally been stated  
that the handwriting was that of Mr  
Jefferson, but I am informed by Mr  
Dwight, the librarian of the State depart­  
ment, that this is a popular error, though  
the script is in a hand not unlike his. The  
following is the recommendation of the  
committee  
The great seal should on one side have
