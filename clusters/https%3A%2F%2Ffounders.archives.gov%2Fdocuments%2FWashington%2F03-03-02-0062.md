ield, shall not have a Tent to lay in—a propos, what is doing with mine?  
These are Evils, but small in comparison of those, which disturb my present repose. Our Inlistments are at a stand—the fears I ever entertaind are realiz’d—that is, the discontented Officers (for I do not know how else to acct for it) have thrown such difficulties, or Stumbling blocks in the way of Recruiting that I no longer entertain a hope of compleating the Army by Voluntary Inlistments, &amp; I see no move, or likelihood of one, to do it by other mean’s—In the two last Weeks we have Inlisted but abt 1000 Men, whereas I was confidently bid to believe, by all the Officers I conversed with, that we should, by this time, have had the Regiments nearly compleated—Our total number upon Paper amounts to abt 10500 but as a large portion of these are returnd not joind, I never expect to receive them; as, an ineffectual Order has once Issued to call them In—another is now gone forth, peremptorily requireng all Officers under pain of being Cashierd, &amp; Recruits, as being treated as Deserters, to join their respective Regiments by the first day of next Month that I may know my real strength; but if my fears are not imaginary, I shall have a dreadful acct of the advanc’d Months pay. In consequence of the Assurances given, &amp; my expectation of having at least Men enough Inlisted to defend our  
  
lines, to which may be added my unwillingness of burthening the caus⟨e⟩ with unnecessary expence, no relief of Militia has been order’d In to supply the places of those who are releasd from their Ingagement To morrow, and on whom (thô many have promis’d to continue out the Month) their is no security of their Stay.  
Thus am I situated with respect to Men—with regard to Arms I am yet worse of—before the dissolution of the old Army I Issued an Order directing three judicious Men of each Brigade to attend—review—and appraise the good Arms of every Regiment—&amp; finding a very great unwillingness in the Men to part with their Arms, at the same time, not having it in my power to pay them for the Months of Novr &amp; Decr I threatned, severely, that every Soldier who carried away his Firelock, without leave, should never receive pay for those Months; yet, so many have been carried of, partly by stealth, but cheefly as condemn’d, that we have not, at this time 100 Guns in the Stores of all that have been taken in the Prize Ship, and from the Soldiery notwithstanding our Regiments are not half compleat—at the same time I am told, and believe it, that to restrain the Inlistment to Men with Arms you will get but few of the former, &amp; still fewer of the latter wch would be good for any thing: How to get furnish’d I know not—I have applied to this &amp; the Neighbouring Colonies but with what success, time only can tell. the reflection upon my Situation, &amp; that of this Army, produces many an uneasy hour when all around me are wrapped in Sleep. Few People know the Predicament we are In, on a thousand Accts—fewer still will beleive, if any disaster happens to these Lines, from what causes it flows—I have often thought, how much happier I should have been, if, instead of accepting of a command under such Circumstances I had taken my Musket upon my Shoulder &amp; enterd the Ranks, or, if I could have justified the Measure to Posterity, &amp; my own Conscience, had retir’d to the back Country, &amp; livd in a Wig-wam—If I shall be able to rise superior to these, and many other difficulties, which might be innumerated, I shall most religiously believe that the finger of Providence is in it, to blind the Eyes of our Enemys; for surely if we get well throw this Month, it must be for want of their knowing the disadvantages we labour under.  
Could I have foreseen the difficulties which have come upon  
  
us—could I have known that such a backwardness would have been discoverd in the old Soldiers to the Service, all the Generals upon Earth should not have convincd me of the propriety of delaying an Attack upon Boston till this time. When it can now be attempted I will not undertake to Say, but thus much I will answer for, that no oppertunity can present itself earlier than my wishes—but—as

These are evils, but small in comparison of those  
which disturb my present repose; Our enlistments  
are at a stand; the fears I ever entertained are real-  
ized; that is, the discontented officers (for I do not  
know how else to account for it) have thrown such  
difficulties or stumbling-blocks in the way of recruit-  
ing, that I no longer entertain a hope of completing  
the army by voluntary enlistments, and I see no  
move nor likelihood to do it by other means. In the  
last two weeks, we have enlisted but about a thou-  
sand men ; whereas, I was confidently led to believe,  
by all the officers I conversed with, that we should,  
by this time, have had the regiments nearly complet-  
ed. Our total number upon paper amounts to about  
ten thousand five hundred ; but as a large portion of  
these are returned ‘not joined,” I never expect to  
receive them, as an ineffectual order has once issu-  
ed to cal] them in. Another is now gone forth,  
peremptorily requiring all officers, under pain of be-  
ing cashiered, and recruits, of being treated as desert-  
ers, to join their respective regiments by the first day  
of next month, that f may know my real strength;

ments to-morrow, and as to wlhoin, though many  
  
  
  
  
  
have promised to continue out the month, there is no  
security for their stay.  
  
Thus am J situated, with respect to men.  
regard to arms, I am yet worse off,  
  
With}  
Betore-the dis.  
solution of the old army, I issued an order, directing  
three judicious men of each brigade, to attend, re-  
view, aud appraise the good arms of every regiment ;  
and, finding a very great unwillingness in the men  
to part with their arms, (at the same time not having  
it in my power to pay them for the months of No-  
vember and December,) I threatened severely, that |  
every soldicr who should carry away his fire-lock |  
  
  
  
without leave, should never receive pay for those  
months. Yet, so many have been carried off, partly  
by stealth, but chiefly as condemned, that we have  
not, at this time, one hundred guns in the stores, of  
all that have been taken in the prize-ship and from |  
the soldiery, notwithstanding our regiments are not  
half complete. Atthe same time, I am told, and  
believe it, that, to restrain the enlistment to men  
with arms, you will get but few of the former, and  
sili fewer of the latter, which would be good for any  
  
  
  
thing. How to get furnished I know not. I have  
applied to this and the neighboring colonies, but with  
what success time only can tell. The reflection  
on my situation, and that of this army, produces  
many an unhappy hour, when all around me are  
wrapped in sleep. Few people know the predica-  
ment we are in, on a thousand accounts ; fewer, still,  
will believe, if any disaster happens to these lines,  
from what cause it flows. I have often thought,  
how much happier I should have been, if, instead of  
accepting the command under such circumstances, I  
had taken my musket on my shoulder and entered  
the ranks; or, if 1 could have justified the measure  
to posterity and my own conscience, had retired to  
the back country and lived ina wigwam. If I shall  
be able to rise superior to these and many other diffi-  
culties which might be enumerated, I shall most re-  
ligiously believe that the finger of Providence is in  
it, to blind the eyes of our enemies; for, surely, if we  
get well through this month, it must be for want of  
their knowing the disadvantages we labor under.
