Sir,  
						Washington January 26th. 1808  
					  
					Having had the honor to state to You, that I am expressly precluded by my Instructions, from entering upon any negotiation for the Adjustment of the differences arising from the Encounter of His Majesty’s Ship Leopard and the Frigate of the United States  
						the Chesapeake; as long as the the Proclamation of the President of the United States of the 2d. July 1807 shall be in force, I beg leave to offer You such farther Explanation of the Nature of that Condition, as appears to me Calculated to place the Motives  
						under which it has been enjoined to me thus to bring it forward, in their true light.  
					In whatever spirit that Instrument was issued, it is sufficiently obvious, that it has been productive of considerable prejudice to His Majesty’s Interests as confided to His Military and other Servants in the United States, to the Honor of His Flag, and to  
						the Privileges of His Ministers accredited to the American Government. From the operation of this Proclamation have unavoidably resulted Effects of retaliation, and self-assumed redress, which might be held to affect materially the question of the reparation due to the United  
						States, especially in as much as its execution has been persevered in after the knowledge of His Majesty’s early, unequivocal, and unsollicited disavowal of the unauthorised Act of Admiral Berkeley, His disclaimer of the Pretension exhibited by that Officer  
						to search the National Ships of a Friendly Power for deserters, and the Assurances of prompt and effectual reparation, all communicated without loss of time, to the Minister of the United States in London, so as not to leave a doubt as to His Majesty’s just and Amicable  
						intentions. But His Majesty making every allowance for the irritation which was excited, and the Misapprehensions which existed, has authorised me to proceed in the Negotiation upon the sole discontinuance of measures of so inimical a  
						tendency.  
					You are aware, Sir, that any delay, which may have arisen in the Adjustment of the present differences is not imputable to an intention of procrastination on the part of His Majesty’s Government; on the contrary, Its anxiety to terminate  
						as expeditiously as possible the discussion of a matter so interesting to both Nations has been evinced by the communication made by Mr. Secretary Canning to Mr. Monroe, before that Minister of the United States was even informed of the Encounter, and now by the  
							promptitude with which It has dispatched a special Mission to this Country for that Express purpose.  
					I can have no difficulty in stating anew to You, with respect to the Provisions of my Instructions, calculated as they are to insure an honorable adjustment of the important point in Question, and to remove the Impressions, which the late cause of  
						difference may have excited in the minds of this Nation, that I am Authorised to Express my Conviction, that they are such, as will enable me to terminate the Negotiation amicably &amp; satisfactorily.  
					Having learnt from You, Sir, that it is solely as a measure of precaution, the provisions of the Proclamation are now enforced, I must persuade myself that a due consideration of His Majesty’s conduct in this transaction will remove as well any  
						Misapprehensions, which may have been entertained respecting His Majesty’s Dispositions towards the United States, as the Grounds upon which that Enforcement rests, and the more so as it has long been a matter of notoriety, that the orders, issued to the officers of His  
						Majesty’s Navy in his Proclamation of the 16th. October 1807, afford ample Security, that no attempt can again be made to Assert a Pretension, which His Majesty from the first disavowed.  
					I may add, that if His Majesty has not commanded me to enter into the discussion of the other causes of Complaint, stated to arise from the conduct of His Naval Commanders in these Seas prior to the encounter of the Leopard, and the Chesapeake, it was  
						because it has been deemed improper to mingle them, whatever may be their merits, with the present Matter so much more interesting, and important in its Nature; an opinion originally, and distinctly expressed by Mr. Monroe, and assented to by Mr. Secretary  
						Canning. But if upon this more recent, and more weighty matter of discussion, upon which the Proclamation mainly and materially rests, His Majesty’s amicable Intentions are unequivocally evinced, it is sufficiently clear, that no hostile disposition can be  
							supposed to exist on his part, nor can any views be attributed to His Government, such, as requiring to be Counteracted by measures of precaution, could be deduced from transactions, which preceded that Encounter.  
					In offering these elucidations, I should observe, that the view in which I have brought forward the Preliminary, which I have specified, is neither as to demand concession, or redress, as for a wrong committed: into such the claim to a discontinuance of  
						hostile provsions cannot be construed; but it is simply to require a cessation of Enactments injurious in their Effects, and which, if persisted in, especially after these Explanations, must evince a spirit of hostility, under which His Majesty could not Authorise the  
						prosecution of the present Negotiation either consistently with His own Honor, or with any well founded Expectation of the renewal or duration of that Good Understanding between the two Countries, which it is equally the Interest of Both to foster, and to Ameliorate. I have  
						the Honor to be with the highest consideration, Sir, Your most obedient, &amp; most humble Servant,

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
for deserters, and the assurances  
of prompt and effectual reparation,  
all communicated, without loss of  
time, to the minister of the United  
States in London, so as not to  
leave a doubt as to his majesty’s  
just and amicable intentions. But  
his majesty, making every allow-  
ance for the irritation which was  
excited, and the misapprehensions  
which existed, has authorized me  
to proceed in the negotiation upon  
the sole discontinuance of mea-  
sures of so mimical a tendency.  
  
You are aware, sir, that any de-  
jay which may have arisen in the  
adjustment of the present differ-  
ences, is not imputable to an in-  
tention of procrastination on the  
part of his majesty’s government ;  
on the contrary, its anxiety to ter-  
miunate, as expeditiously as possi-  
ble, the discussion of a matter so  
interesting to both nations, has  
been evinced by the communica-  
tion made by Mr. secretary Can-  
ning to Mr. Monroe, before the  
minister of the United States was  
even informed of the encounter,  
and now by the promptitude with  
which it has dispatched a special  
mission to this country for that  
express purpose.  
  
I can have no difficulty in stating  
anew to you, with respect to the  
provisions of my instructions, cal-  
culated as they are to insure an  
honourable adjustment of the im-  
portant point in question, and to  
remove the impressions which the  
late cause of difference may have  
excited in the minds of this na-  
tion, that I am authorized to ex-  
press my conviction, that they are  
such as will enable me to termi-  
nate the negotiations amicably and  
satisfactorily.  
  
Having learnt from you, sir,  
that it is solely as a measure of  
precaution the provisions of the  
  
41s  
  
proclamation are now enforced, I  
must persuade myseli, that a due  
consideration of his majesty’s con-  
duct in this transaction will re-  
move as well any misapprehen-  
sions which may have been enter-  
tained respecting his majesty’s dis-  
positions towards the United  
States, as the grounds upon which  
that enforcement rests, and the  
more so, as it has long been a  
matter of notoriety that the orders  
issued to the officers of his majes-  
ty’s navy, in his proclamation of  
the 16th October, 1807, afford am-  
ple security that no attempt can  
be made to assert a pretension,  
which his majesty from the first  
disavowed.  
  
I may add, that if his majesty  
has not commanded me to enter  
into a discussion of the other cau-  
ses of complaint, stated to arise  
from the conductof his naval com-  
manders in these seas, prior to the  
encounter of the Leopard and the  
Chesapeake, it was because it has  
been deemed improper to mingle  
them, whatever may be their me-  
rits, with the present matter, so  
much more interesting and mmpor-  
tant in its nature: an opinion ori-  
ginally and distinctly expressed by  
Mr. Monroe, and assenied to by  
Mr. secretary Canning. But if  
upon this more recent and more  
weighty matter of discussion, up-  
on which the proclamation mainly  
and materially rests, his majesty’s  
amicable intentions are unequivo-  
cally evinced, it is sufficiently  
clear, that no hostile disposition  
can be supposed to exist on his  
part, nor can any views be attri-  
buted to his governi.ent, such as,  
requiring to be counteracted by  
measures of precaution, could be  
deduced {rom transactions which  
preceded that encounter.  
  
In offering these elucidations,  
  
414 AMERICAN  
I should observe, that the view in  
which I have brought forward the  
preliminary which I have speci-  
fied, is neither as to demand con-  
cession, or redress, as for a wrong  
committed; into such, the claim  
of a discontinuance of hostile pro-  
visions cannot be construed ; butit  
is simply to require a cessation of  
enactments injurious in their ef-  
fects, and which, if persisted in,  
especially after these explanations,  
must evince a spirit of hostility,  
under which his majesty could  
not authorize the prosecution of  
the present negotiation, either con-  
sistently with his own honour, or  
with any well founded expectation  
of the renewal or duration of that  
understanding between the  
two countries, which it is equally  
the interest of both to foster, and  
to ameliorate.  
I have the honour to be, &amp;c.,

of the United States was even informed of the

\vhich it has dispatched a special mission to this

Washington, January 26th} 1H08.  
Sir,  
IIAVINfl had the honor to stale to you,  
that I am expressly precluded by my in­  
structions from entering upon any negotia­  
tion for the adjustment of the differences  
arising from the encounter of his majesty&#x27;s  
ship Leopard and the frigate of the United  
States, the Chesapeake, as long as the  
proclamation of the President of the Uni­  
  
Ittl VII iliv VII JIlIVs lnWf , Mlilil lie  
in force, 1 beg leave tc offer you such farther  
explanation of the nature of that condition,  
as appears to me calculated to place the  
motives, under which it has been enjoined  
to me thus to bring it forward in their true  
light.  
fn whatever spirit that instrument was is­  
sued, it is sufficiently obvious, that it lias  
hern productive of considerable prejudice  
to his majesty’s interests, as confided to his  
military and other sorvnnts in the United  
States, to the honor of his Hag, and to the  
privileges of his ministers accre dited to the  
American government. From the operation  
of this proclamation hnvc unavoidably re­  
stilted effects of retaliation, St self assumed  
redress, which might be held to affect ma­  
terially the question of the reparation due  
to the United S’atcs, especially Inasmuch  
asitscxcCnttnn has been persevered in after  
the knowledge of hi* majesty’s early, une­  
quivocal, and unsolicited disavowal of the  
unauthorised act of admiral Berkeley,—  
his disclaimer of the pretension exhibited  
by that officer to search the national ships  
of a friendly power for deserters, and the  
assurances of prompt and effectual repara­  
tion, all communicated without ions of time,  
?o the minister of the United States in  
London, so us not to leave n doubt as to his  
majesty’s just and amicable intentions. But  
his majesty, innking evt ry allowance for  
the irritation whitu was excited, and the  
  
misapprehensions which existed, has au­  
thorised me to proceed in the negotiation  
upon the sole discontinuance of measures of  
so inimical a tendency.  
You arc aware, sir, that any delay, which,  
may have arisen in the adjustment of the  
present differences, is not iinputuhle to an  
intention of procrastination on the part oC  
his majesty’s government; on the contrary,  
its anxiety to terminate ns^xpeditlously h*  
possible the discussion of a mutter so inter­  
esting to both nations, hits b*. cii evinced by  
the communication made by Mr Secretary  
Canning to Mr Monroe, before that minis­  
ter of tlie Uni&#x27;l l State.&#x27;, was even iiifcrniedl  
of the enceutiti v, anti now, by the pronui­  
tude with w it ti:»s dispatched a special  
miss&#x27;on to the, country, for that express  
purpose.  
I can have no d fficully in stating anew  
to you, with respect to the provisions of my  
instructions, c cufated as lliey are to in­  
sure an honorable adjustment of the impor­  
tant point in question, arid to remove the*  
impressions, which the late cause of differ­  
ence may have excited in the minds of thi*  
nation, that I am authorised to express my  
conviction, that M cy are such as will ena­  
ble me to terminate the negotiation amica­  
bly and satisfactor ly.  
Having learnt from you, sir, thnt it is  
solely as a measure of precaution, the pro­  
visiuns of thi proclamation are now enfor­  
ced. I must persuade myself, that ^ due  
consideration ot his majesty’s conduct iu  
this transaction, will remove as well any  
misapprehensions which may be entertain­  
ed respecting his majesty&#x27;s dispositions to­  
wards the United htates, as the ground*  
upon which that enforcement rests, and the  
more so, as it lias long been a matter of no­  
toriety, that the orders issued to the offi­  
cers of his majesty % navy, in his proclama­  
tion of the ltith October, 1 Ho7, afforded  
ample security, th it no attempt can again  
he made to assert a pi’-tension. which his  
majesty from the first disavowed.  
1 may add, that if his majesty hns not  
commanded me to enter into the discussion  
of the other causes of complaint, stated tia  
arise from the conduct of his naval c*m­  
mnnders in these seas, prior to the encoun­  
ter of the Leopard and the Chesapeake, it  
w«as because it has been deemed improper  
to mingle them, whatever may be their  
merits, with the present matter, so much  
more interesting and important in its na­  
ture ; an opinion originally and distinctly  
expressed by Mr M time, and assented to  
oy Mr Secret.,ry C lining, ilut if, upon  
this Mon* recent and more weighty matter  
■ f discussion, upon which the proclamatir u  
mainly anil materially rests, his majesty’s  
amicable intentions are unequivocally e­  
v need, it is sufficiently clear, that no hos­  
tile disposition can be supposed to exist on  
  
t»» l&gt;.i government, sych, ns requiring to bo •  
counteracted hy measures ot precaution,  
could l&gt;c deduced tnini transactions which  
prec edud tiiut encounter.  
h* offering these elucidations, I should ob­  
serve ilint the view in which 1 have brought  
forward the preliminary, which I have spe­  
cified, is neither as to demand concession  
oi redress, as f. r u wrong commuted : into  
such the claim i.» a discontinuance of hostile  
provisions cannot be construed; bat it in  
simply t« require a cessation of nactments  
injurious in their « Heels, and which, if  
persisted in, especially after these expla­  
nations, must evince a spirit of hostility, un­  
der which his majesty could not au’lioriso  
the prosecution ot tin* present negociation,  
either consistently with his own honor, «r  
with any well founded expectation of the  
renewal or duration • f that good understan­  
ding between tlic twci nntrics, which it is

Washington, January :&gt;()&#x27;, 1808.  
Sir,  
  
Having had the honour to state to you, that I  
am expressly precluded by my instructions from en­  
tering upon any negotiation tor the adjustment of  
the differences arising from the encounter of his  
majesty’s ship Leopard. and the frigate of the ti­  
nned States, the Chesapeake, as long as the pro­  
clamation of the president of the United States, of  
the 2d July, 1807, shall be in lorce, I beg leave to  
offer you such farther explanation of the nature of  
that condition, as appems to me calculated to place  
the motives under which it has been enjoined to me  
thus to bring it forward in their true light.  
In whatever spirit that instrument was issued, it  
is sufficiently obvious, that it has been productive  
of considerable prejudice to his majesty’s interests,  
as confuted to his military and other servants in the  
United Slates ; to the honour of his flag, and to the  
privileges of bis ministers accredited to the Ameri­  
lan government. From the operation of this pro­  
clamation, have unavoidably resulted eflects of reta­  
il ilion and self assumed redress which might be held  
affect materially the question of the reparation  
due to the United Stat“s, especially inasmuch as its  
execution has been persevered in after the know­  
! b-dge ol his majesty’s early, unequivocal, and unso­  
licited disavowal of tlie unauthorized act of admiral  
Berkeley, his disclaimer ol the pretension exhibited  
bv that officer to seaich the national ships of a  
Iriendly power for the deserters, and the assurances  
ol prompt and effectual reparation; all communi­  
cated wiinout loss of time, to the minister ol the  
L&#x27;uited States in London, so as not to leave a doubt  
as to his majesty s just arid amicable intentions.—  
But his majesty, making every allowance for the  
irritation which was excited, and the misapprehen­  
sions which existed, has authorized me to proceed  
in ille negotiation upon the soic discontinuance ot  
[ measures of so inimical a tendency.  
\ ou are aware, sir, that any delay which may  
have arisen in the adjustment of the present differ­  
ence, is not imputable to an intention of procrasti­  
nation on the part of his majesty’s government ;  
on the contrary, its anxiety to terminate as expedi­  
tiously as possible the discussion of a matter so in­  
teresting to both nations has been evinced by the  
1 ommuniraiion made by Mr. Secretary Canning,  
j to Mr. M inroe, before that minister of the United  
i Slates was ev*-n inlorintd ol the encounter ; and  
now by the piomp!.tnriu with winch it lias dispatch­  
j cm a special mission to this country for that express  
pill pose.  
1 can have no difficulty in slating anew to you,  
with le-pcci to th&gt; provisions ol my instructions,  
• ■ah &#x27;dated as tiny are to insure hd honourable ad­  
justment r&gt;! theiaipo taut point :n question, and to  
J lemove the impressions which the late cause ofdil­  
leience in iy have excited .n the minds of this nati­  
on, I bat 1 atn authorised to express mv conviction,  
that they are sur h as w ill enable me to terminate  
the negotiation amicably and satis!,irtorily.  
Having learnt from you, sir, that it is solely as a  
measure of precaution, that the provisions of the  
proclamation aie now enforced, 1 must persuade  
myselt that a due consideration of his majesty&#x27;s  
conduct in this transaction, will remove as well any  
misapprehensions which may have been entertained  
respecting his majesty’s dispositions towards the  
I f lilted btatfs and the grounds upon which that en­  
i imvetijeiii rests, and the more so, us it has long  
i lid n a matter ot notoriety, that the orders, issued  
to the officers of his majesty&#x27;s navy, in his procla­  
mation ol the lCitli Oct. 1S07, atlord ample securi­  
ty that no attempt can agaiu be made to assert a  
pretension, which bis majesty from the first disa­  
vowed.  
  
i may aan, mat n ms majesty has not commanded  
me to mb r iuto the- discuasinu of those other rauses  
ol complaint, stated to arise from the conduct ot his  
naval commanders in these seas, prior to the encoun­  
ter ot the Leopard and the Chesapeake, it was be­  
cause it hail been deemed improper to mingle them,  
whatever may be their merits, with the present  
matter, so much more interesting and important in  
its nature ; an op.nion, originally and distinctly ex­  
pressed by Mr Momu&lt;*, and assented to by Mr.  
Canning. But il, upon this more recent and more  
weighty matter of discussion, upon which the pro­  
clamation mainly and materially rests, his majes­  
ty s amicable intentions are unequivocally evinced,  
it is sufficiently clear, that no hostile disposition can  
be supposed to exist on his part ; nor can any views  
beatnbuted to his government, such as, requiting  
to be counteracted by measures of precaution, could  
be dedm cd from transactions which preceded that  
encounter.  
In offering these elucidations, I should observe,  
that the views in which i have brought lorward the  
preliminary, which I have specilied, is neither as to  
d&#x27;-mund concession, or redress, as for a wrong com­

[Wbolk No. 465.]  
  
CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN  
Mr. MADISON and Mr. ROSE,  
On ike subject of the attack on the  
Chesapeake.  
Washington, Januar y 26th, 1808.  
SIR, -  
H AVING had the honor to state  
to you, that 1 am expressly precluded by  
my instructions from entering into any  
negotiation for the adjustment of the  
differences arising from the encounter Of  
his majesty’s ship Leopard and the fri­  
gate of the United States, the Chesa­  
peake, as long as the proclamation of the  
President of ihe United Suites, of the 2d  
®f July, 1807, shall be in force, I beg  
leave to offer you such farther explana­  
tion of the nature of that Condition, as  
appears to me calculated to place the mo­  
tives, under which it has been enjoined  
to me thus to bring it forward in their  
true light.  
In whatever spirit that instrument was  
issued, it is sufficiently obvious, tfrat it  
has been productive of considerable pre­  
judice to his majesty’s interest as confi­  
ded to his military and other servants in  
the United States, to the honor of his  
flag, and to the privileges of his funis­  
tors accredited to the American govern­  
ment. From the operation of this pro­  
clamation have unavoidable resulted ef­  
_ feels of retaliation, and seif assumed re­  
dress, which might he held tu affect ma­  
terially the question of the reparat ion due  
to the U. S. especially in as much as its  
execution has been persevered in alter  
the Knowledge of his majesty&#x27;s early,  
unequivocal, nod unsolicited disavowal  
o/ the unauthdiised act of admiral Berke­  
ley,—his disclaimer ..of the pretension  
exhibited by that officer to search the  
national ships Of a friendly power for de­  
serters, and the assurances of prdmpt  
and effectual reparation, all communica­  
ted without loss of time, to the minister  
of the U. S- in London, so as not to  
leave a doubt to bis majesty’s just and  
amicable intentions. But his majesty’s  
Waiting every allowance for the irritation  
which was excited, and the misappre­  
hensions which existed, has authorised  
me to proceed in the negociatinn upon  
the sole discontinuance of measures of  
so inimical a tendency.  
You are aware sir, that anv delay,  
which may have arisen in the adjustment  
of the present difference, is not imputa- &#x27;  
ble to an intention of procrastination on  
the part, of his majesty’s government;  
on the contrary, its anxiety to terminate  
as expeditiously as possible the discus,  
tion of a matter su interesting to both  
nations, has bet;n evinced by the com­  
munication made by Mr. Seirctary Can­  
ning to Mr. Mumoe, before that mini*,  
ter of the 0. States was infor med o| the  
encounter, sad now by the promptitude  
with which it has dispatched a special  
.• . . mission to this country, fur that express  
  
purpose. r ....... ,  
I cap have no difficulty in siting anew  
fo you, with respect to the provisions of  
my instructions, calculated os they are  
to insure an .honourable adjustment to  
the important point in.qUoaion, and to  
remove the impressions, which the late  
cause of difference may have etched ia  
the minds of this nation, that * am au­  
thorised to eapresa my conviction, that  
they, are such as will enable me to termi­  
mate the negotiation amicably and satis­  
factorily. .  
Having learnt from you, sir, that it is  
solely as a measure of precaution, the  
provisions of the proclamation are How  
enforced, 1 mitst persuade myself, thqt  
a due consideration of his majesty&#x27;s con­  
duct in this transaction, will remove as  
well as any misapprehensions which may  
be entertained respecting his majesty&#x27;s  
dispositions towa&gt;ds the United States,  
as the grounds upon which that  
enforce­  
ment rests, anti the more so, as it has  
long been a matter of notoriety, that the  
orders issued to the officer# of his majes­  
ty’s navy, in his proclamation of the 16th  
of October, 180/, afforded ample se­  
curity, that no attempt can again be made  
to assert a prefect ion, which his majes­  
ty from the first disavowed,  
l may aild, that if his majesty has not  
commanded me to ent. r into the discus­  
s’ton of thy oilier cauacs of complaint,  
stated to arise from the cooduct of his  
naval tommandtrs in these seas, pror  
to ihe encounter of the Leopard and the  
Chesapeake, .it Was because it has been  
■ f  
  
deethed improper to mingle them, what­  
ever may be their merits, with the pro  
sent matter, so much more interesting  
and important ;in its nature; an opinion  
originally and distinctly expressed by  
Mr. Munroe, and assented to by Mr.  
Secretary Canning. But if, upon thin  
more recent and more weighty matter  
of discussion, upon which the proclama­  
| lion mainlv and materially rests, his ma­  
jesty’s amicable intentions are unequivo­  
cally evinced, it ta sufficiently clear, that  
no hostile disposition can be supposed to  
exist on his part, nor can any views be  
attributed to hi* government, such as  
requiring to be counteracted bv measures  
of precaution, could be dtd&#x27;tced from  
transactions which preceded that en­  
counter. :.,\i  
In offeribg these elucidations, I should  
observe, that the vlen in which I have  
brought forward the preliminary, I have  
specified, is neither as to demand con­  
cession or redress, as for a wrong corn­  
mi ted; into such the claim to a discon­  
tinuance ol hostile provisions cannot be  
construed: But it is simply to require n  
cessation of enactments injurious ta their  
effects and which, if persisted in, es­  
pecially after these explanations, mutt  
evince a spirit of hostiUtyjr under which  
his majesty could not authorise the pro­  
secution of the present negotiation, ei­  
ther consistently with his own honor, of  
with any well founded expectation of the  
renewal or duration of that good under­  
standing between the two countries,  
which it is equally the interest of both to  
foster and to ameliorate.  
I have the honor to be, - with the  
highest consideration. Sir your most  
obedient and humble servant,

prehensions which may have been enter­  
tained refpeing his majesty’s dispositions  
towards the United States, as the grounds  
upon which that enforcement relts, and the  
more so, as it has long been a matter of no­  
toriety, that the orders ifflued to the officers

Ms. Rose To Mr. Manisox, Janvary  
26, 1808.  
  
Sir,—Having had the honour to state to  
you, that 1 am expressly precluded by my  
instructions from entering upon any nego-  
tiation for the adjustment of the differences  
arising from the encounter of his Majesty&#x27;s  
ship Leopard, and the frigate of the U,  
States, the Chesapeake, as long as the pro-  
clamation of the president of the U. S., of  
the 2d July, 1807, shall be in force, I beg  
leave to offer you such farther explanation  
of the nature of that condition, as appears  
to me calculated to place the motives under  
which it has been enjoined to me thus to  
bring it forward in their trae Jight.—In  
whatever spirit that instrament was issued,  
it is sufficiently obvious, that it has been  
productive of considerable prejudice to his  
majesty’s interests as confided to his military  
and other servants in the U. S., to the ho-  
nour of his flag, and to the privileges of  
his ministers accredited to the American  
government. From the operation of | this  
proclamation have unavoidably resulted ef-  
tects of retalia\ion and self assumed redress,  
which might be held to affect materially the  
question of the reparation due to the U. S.,  
  
  
  
been persevered in after the knowledge of  
his majesty’s early, unequivocal, and unso-  
licited disavowal of the unauthorized act of  
admiral Berkeley, his disclaiming of the pre.  
tension exhibited by that officer to search  
the national ships of a friendly power for  
deserters, and the assurances of prompt and  
effectual reparation, all communicate sit}.  
out loss of time, to the minister of the U.  
S. in London, SO as not to leave a doubt as  
to his majesty’s just and amicable intentions,  
But his maj., making every allowance for  
the irritation which was excited, and the  
misapprehensions which existed, has autho-  
rized me to proceed in the negotiation upon  
the sole discontinuance of measures of so  
inimical a tendency.—You are aware, sir,  
that any delay which may have arisen in the  
  
adjustment of the present differences, js  
not imputable to an intention of procrasti-  
nation on the part of his majesty’s govern-  
  
ment: on the contrary, its anxiety to ter-  
  
minate as expeditiously as possible the  
discussion of a matter so interesting to both  
  
nations, has been evinced by the communi-  
  
cation made by Mr. secretary Canning, to  
Mr. Munroe, before the minister of the U.  
  
S. was even informed of the encounter, and  
  
now by the promptitude with which it has  
  
dspatched a special mission to this country  
  
| for that express purpose.—I can have no  
_ difheulty in stating anew to you, with respect  
  
to the provisions of my instructions, calcv-  
lated as they are to ensure an honourable

which may have been entertained respecting  
  
his majesty’s dispositions towards the U. S.  
as the grounds upon which that enforcement  
rests, and the more so, as it has long been  
a matter of notoriety that the orders issued  
to the officers of his majesty&#x27;s navy, in his  
proclamation of 15th Oct. 1807, afford am-  
ple security that no attempt can be made to  
assert a pretension, which his maj. from the

it was because it had been deemed improper  
to mingle them, whatever may be their  
merits, with the _ present matter so, much  
more interesting and important in its nature;  
an opinion, originally and distinctly expres-  
sed by Mr. Munroe, and assented to by Mr.  
sec. Canning. But if upon this more re-  
cent&#x27;and more weighty matter of discussion  
upon which the proclamation mainly and  
materially rests, his majesty’s amicable in-  
tentions are unequivocally evinced, it is  
sufhiciently clear, that no hostile disposition  
can be supposed to exist on his part, nor can  
any views be attributed to his government,  
such as, requiring to be counteracted by  
measures of precaution, could be deducted  
from transactions which preceded that  
encounter.—In offering these elucidations,  
I should observe that the view in which |

I have specified, is neither as to demand,  
concession or redress, as for a wrong com-  
mitted; into such, the claim of a discon-  
tintuance of hostile provisions cannot be con-  
structed ; but it is simply to require a cessa-  
tion of enactments injurious in their effects,  
and which, if persisted in, especially after  
  
these explanations, must evince a spirit of |  
  
hostility, under which his maj. could not  
  
authorize the prosecution of the pesent  
negotiation, either consistently with his own  
honour, or with any well founded expecte-

Srr—Having had the honour to state to you,  
ihat Iam expressly excluded by my instructions,  
from entering upon any negociation for the adjuast-  
ment of the differences arising from the encounter  
of his majesty’s ship Leopard, and the frigate of  
the United States, the Chesapeake, as long: as the  
proclamation of the president of the United States,  
of the 2d of July, 1807, [see page 49] shall be in  
force, I beg leave to offer you such farther expla-  
nation of the nature of that condition, as appear?  
to me calculated to place the motives, under which  
it has been enjoined to me thus to bring it forward,  
in their true light.  
  
In whatever spirit that instrument was issued, it  
:s sufficiently obvious, that it has been productive  
of considerable prejudice to his majesty’s interests,  
as considered to his military and other servants in  
the United States, to the honor ofhis flag, and to  
the privileges of his ministers accredited to the  
American government. From the operation of  
this proclamation have unavoidabiy resulted cffects  
of retaliation, and self-assumed redress, which  
  
might be held to affect materially the question of!  
  
the reparation due to the United States, especially  
inasmuch as its execution has been persevered in  
after the knowledge of his majesty’s early unequi-  
vocal, and unsolicited disavowal of the unauthori-  
sed act of admiral Berkely ;—his disclaimer of the  
pretensions exhibited by that officer to scarch the  
national ships ofa friendly power for deserters, and  
the assurances of prompt and effectual reparation,  
all communicated without loss of time. to the mi-  
nister of the United States in London, so as not to  
‘eave a doubt as to his majesty*s just and amicable  
intentions. But his majesty, making every allow-  
ance for the irritation which was excited, andthe  
misapprehensions which existed, has authosired me  
to proceed in the negociation upon the sole discon-  
unuance of measures of so inimical a tendency.  
  
You are aware, sir, that any delay which may  
have arisen in the adjustment of the present diffcr-  
  
—  
  
tination on the part of his majesty’s government  
on the contrary, its anxiety to terminate as expedi-  
tiously as possible the discussion of a matter so in-  
teresting to both nations, has been evinced Ly the  
communications made by Mr. secretary Canning  
to Mr. Monroe, before that minister of the United  
States was eveninformed of the encounter, and  
now by the promptitude with which it has dispatch-  
ed a special mission to this country, forthat express  
purpose.  
  
I can have no difficulty in stating anew to you,  
with respect to the provisions of my instructions,  
calculated as they are to insure an honorable ad-  
justment of the important point in question, and to  
remove the impressions which the late cause of dif-  
ferences may have excited inthe minds of this na-  
tion that I am authorised to express my conviction  
that they are such as will enable me to terniinate  
the negociation amicably and satisfactorily.  
| Having learnt f-om you, sir, that itis solely as a  
measure of precaution the provisions of the procla-  
mation are now enforced, I must persuade myself,  
that a due consideration of his majesty’s conduct  
in this transaction, will remove as well as any misap-  
prehensions which may be entertained respecting  
his majesty’s disposition towarcs the United States,  
as the groundsupon which that enforcement rests,  
and the more so, as it has long been a matter of  
notoriety, that the orders issued to the officers of  
his majesty’s navy, in his proclamation of the 16th  
October, 1807, afforded ample security, that no at-  
tempt can again be made to assert a pretension,  
which his majesty from the first disavowed.  
  
I may add, that ifhis majesty has not command-  
ed me to enter into the discussion of the other causes  
of complaint, stated to arise from the conduct of  
his naval commanders in these seas, prior to the  
encounter of the Leopard and the Chesapeake, it  
was because it has been deemed improper to mingle  
them, whatever may be their merits, with the pre-  
sent matter, so much morc interesting and impor-  
tant in its nature ; an opinion originally and distinct-  
ly expressed by Mr. Monrog, and assented to by Mr  
Seeretary Canning. But, if, upon this more recent  
and more weighty matter ofdiscussion, upon whick  
the proclamation mainly and materially rests, his  
Majesiy’s amicable intentions are. unequivocally  
evinced, it is sufficiently clear. that no hostile dis-  
  
can any y.ews be attributed to his government,  
sich as requiring to be counteracted by measures  
of precaution, could be deduced from transac-~  
tians which preceded that. encounter.  
  
In offering these clucidations, I should observa  
that the view in which I have brought forward the  
preliminary, which f have specificd, is neither as to  
demand concession or redress, as for a wron  
committed ; into such the claim toa disce stinuancs:  
  
  
  
of hostile provisions cannot. be constru: 7; but it  
  
enees, is not imputahleto an intention of precras- jis simply to reauire a c2geation of enacticrats inf.
