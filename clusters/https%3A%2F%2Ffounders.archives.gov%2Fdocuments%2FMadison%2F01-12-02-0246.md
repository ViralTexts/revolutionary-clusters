[3 September 1789]  
  
  
The Committee of the Whole took up Scott’s motion of 27 August: “That a permanent residence ought to be fixed for the general government of the United States, at some convenient place, as near the centre of wealth, population, and extent of territory as may be consistent with convenience to the navigation of the Atlantic ocean, and having due regard to the particular situation of the western country.”  
  
  
Mr. Madison. I move to strike out the word wealth, because I do not conceive this to be a consideration that ought to have much weight in determining the place where the seat of government ought to be. The two other principles I admit, are such as ought to have their influence; but why wealth should, is not so clear. Government is intended for the accommodation of the citizens at large; an equal facility to communicate with government is due to all ranks; whether to transmit their grievances or requests, or to receive those blessings which the government is intended to dispense. The rich are certainly not less able than those who are indigent, to resort to the seat of government, or to establish the means necessary for receiving those advantages to which, as citizens, they are entitled.  
I should rather suppose, if any distinctions are to be made, or superior advantages to be enjoyed from the presence of the government, that the government ought rather to move toward those, who are the least able to move toward it, and

whole, he did not think that place the best which  
the principles adopted by the commitee Ihould  
seem to lead to, he certainly could not vole for it.  
Mr. Madison moved that the word &quot; wealth&quot;  
be (truck out. He observed that population and  
extent of territory are the only main principles  
which ought to govern. Government is intended  
forthe equalaccominodationof all ranksof citizens.  
They ought all to be so favored, that they may  
easily transmit their grievances, and receive tliofe  
bleflings the government is intended to dispense.  
The rich are certainly not less able than the poor  
torefort to the government,or to eflablilhtlie ne­

there are any superior advantages to be enjoyed  
from the presence of the government, I rather
