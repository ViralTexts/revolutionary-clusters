e Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
United States June 12th 1797—  
  
I have received information from the Commissioner appointed on the part of the United States, pursuant to the third Article of our Treaty with Spain, that the running and marking of the boundary Line, between the Colonies of East and West Florida, and the Territory of the United States, have been delayed by the Officers of his Catholic Majesty; and that they have declared their intention to maintain his Jurisdiction and to suspend the withdrawing of his Troops from the Military Posts they occupy, within the Territory of the United States, untill the two Governments, shall by Negotiation, have settled the meaning of the Second Article, respecting the withdrawing of the Troops, Garrisons, or Settlements of either party, in the Territory of the other, that is, whether when the Spanish Garrisons withdraw, they are to leave the works Standing, or to demolish them; and untill, by an additional Article to the Treaty, the real property of the Inhabitants shall be secured; and likewise untill the Spanish officers are sure the Indians will be pacific—The two first questions if to be determined by Negotiation might be made Subjects of discussion for years, and as no limitation of time can be prescribed to the others, a Certainty in the opinion of the Spanish Officers that the Indians will be pacific, it will be impossible to suffer it, to Remain an Obstacle to the fulfillment of the Treaty on the part of Spain—  
To remove the first difficulty, I have determined, to Leave it to the discretion of the officers of his Catholic Majesty, when they withdraw his troops from the Forts, within the territory of the United States either to leave the works Standing, or to demolish them; and to remove the Second, I shall cause an assurance to be published, and to be particularly communicated to the Minister of his Catholic Majesty, and to the Governor of Louisiana that the Settlers or occupants of the Lands in question shall not be disturbed in their possessions by the Troops of the United States; but on the contrary that they shall be protected in all their lawful claims; and to prevent or Remove every doubt on this point, it merits the consideration of Congress whether it will not be Expedient immediately to pass a Law, giving positive assurances to those Inhabitants, who by fair and regular grants or by occupancy have obtained legal Titles or Equitable Claims to Lands in that Country prior to the final ratification of the Treaty, between the United States and Spain, on the twenty fifth of April 1796.  
This country is rendered peculiarly Valuable by its Inhabitants, who are represented to amount to, nearly Four thousand, generally well affected, and much attached to the United States and Zealous for the Establishment of a Government under their authority—  
I therefore recommend to your consideration, the expediency of Erecting a Government in the District of the Natches similar to that established for the territory North West of the River Ohio, but with certain modifications, relative to Titles or Claims of Land, whether of Individuals or Companies, or to Claims of Jurisdiction of any Individual State:

I HAVE received information from the !  
Commiffiooer appointed on the part of the  
United States, pursuant to the 3d article of  
our Treaty with Spain, that the running  
Bnd marking of the Boundary Line between  
the Colonies of Ealt and Welt Florida, and  
the Territory of the United States, haVe ■  
been delayed by the Officers of his Catholic !  
Majesty, and that they have declared their  
intention to maintain his jurifdidtion, and to &#x27;  
suspend tile withdrawing histroops fromthe 1  
Military posts they occupy within the terri- &#x27;  
tory of the United States, until the two  
Governments (hall, by negociation, have 1  
fettled th; meaning of the 2d article refpedt- &#x27;  
ing the withdrawing of the troops, garri- &#x27;  
•fans, or settlements of either party in the &#x27;  
territory of the1 other; that is, whether :  
when the Spanish garrisons withdraw, they  
are to leave the works Handing or to demo­  
lish them, and until, by an additional article 1  
to the 1 rcaty, the real property of the in- 1  
habitants shall be fee u red, and likewise until &#x27;  
the Spanish Officers are sure the Indians will  
be pac:Sc. The two firft questions, if to be &#x27;  
determined by negociation, might be made  
lubjsdts of diicufljon for years, and as no li- 1  
rotation of time can be prescribed to the  
Other, a certainty in the opinion of the &#x27;  
Spanish Officers, that the Indians will be !  
pacific, it will be impossible to fuffer it to re%  
main an cbftacle to the fulfilment of the  
Treaty on the part of Spain. ]  
To remove the firft difficulty, I have de- j  
termined to leave it to the discretion of the  
Officer&#x27;s of his Catholic Majesty, when they  
withdraw his troops from within the terri­  
tory of the United States, either to leave  
the works standing, or to demolish them.—  
And to remove the second, I shall cause an  
assurance to be published, and to be particu­  
larly communicated to the Minister of his  
Catholic Majesty, and to the Governor of  
Louisiana, that the settlers or occupants of  
the lands in question, shall not be disturbed  
in their possessions by the troops of the Uni­  
ted States ; but, on the contrary, that they  
shall be protedted in all tneir lawful claims,  
and to prevent every doubt on this point, it  
merits the consideration of Congress, whe­  
ther it will not be expedient immediately to  
pass a law, giving positive afTurances to those  
inhabitants who by fair and regular grants,  
or by occupancy, have obtained legal titles  
or equitable claims to lands in that country,  
prior to the final ratification of the Treaty  
between the United States and Spain, on  
rhe 25th of April, 1796.  
This country is rendered peculiarly&#x27;valu­  
able by its inhabitants, who are represented  
to amount to nearly four thousand, gene­  
rally well affedted and much attached to the  
United States, and zealous for the establish­  
ment of a government under their authority.  
I therefore recommend to your considera­  
tion, the expediency of eredting a govern­  
ment in the Diftridt of the Natchez, similar  
to that established for the territory North-  
Weft of the River Ohio, but with certain  
modifications relative to titles or claims of  
land, whether of individuals or companies,  
or to claims of jurisdiction of any indivi­  
dual State.

MessaGE from the PresipENT of the  
UNITED STATES to CONGRESS.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and  
Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
Have received information from the  
  
commiffioner appointed on the part of  
the United States, purfuant to the third  
article of our treaty with Spain, that the  
running and marking of the boundary  
line between the colonies of Eatt and Welt  
Florida, and the territory of the United  
States, have been delayed by the officers  
of his Catholic majetty, and that they  
have declared their intention to maintain  
his jui rifdi&amp;tion, and to faufpend the with-  
drawing his troops from the military pofts  
they occupy within the territory of the  
United States, until the two governments  
fhail, by negaciation, have tettled the  
meaning of the fecond article refpecting  
the withdrawing the troops, ftores, or  
fertle: nents of either party in the territory  
of the other; that is, whether when the  
Spanith garrifons withdraw, they are to  
leave the “works ttanding or to demolifh  
them ; and until, by an Y additional article  
to the treaty, the real property of the jn-  
habitants fhall be. fecured, and likewife  
until the Spanifh officers are fure the In-  
dians will be pacific. |  
  
The two firtt quel tions, if to be deter-  
mined by negociation, might be made  
fubje€{s of difcuffion for years ; and as  
no Jimitation of time can be preferibed to  
  
the other, a cer:ainty in the opinion of  
  
the Spanith officers, that the Indians will  
be pacific, it will be impoffible to fuffer it  
to remain an obitacle to the fulfilment of  
the treaty on the part of Spain.  
  
To remove the firit ditficulty, I have  
  
determined to leave it to the difcretion of  
  
the officers of his Catholig majeity, when  
  
they withdraw his troops from the forts  
within the territory of the United States,  
either to leave the works ftanding or to  
demolifh them. And to remove the fe-  
cond, I thal] caufe an affurance to be pubs  
lithed, and to be particuiarly commu-  
nicated to the minifter of his Catholic mae  
jetty, and to the governor of Louifiana,  
that the fettlers or occupants of the Jands  
in quettion, fhall not be difturbed in their  
poflciiions by the troops of the United  
States ; but, on _ contrary, that they  
fhall be prote&amp;ed in all their lawful  
claims; and to pectooh or remove every  
doubt on this point, it merits the confi-  
deration of congrefs, whether it will not  
be expedient immediately to pafs a law,  
giving pofitive affurances to thofe inha-  
bit ants who by fair and regular grants, or  
by occupancy, have obtained legal titles,  
or equitable claims to lands in that coun-  
try, prior to the final ratification of the  
treaty between the United States and  
Spain, on the 25th April, 1794.  
  
This country is rendered peculiarly va-  
Juable by its inhabit ants, who are repre-  
fentedto amount to nearly four choufand,  
generally well affected and much attached  
to the United States, and zealous for the  
eftabiifament of a government under their  
authority.  
  
i therefore recommend to your confide~  
ration, the expediency of erecting a go-  
vernment in the diftrit of the Natchez,  
fimilar to that eltabuihed for the territory  
north-wett of the river Ohio, but with  
certain modifications relative to titles or  
ciaims of lands, whether of individuals  
or companies, or to clauns of jarifdictiog  
ot any individual {tate.
