 times in the following year—in the Gentleman’s Magazine, the Virginia Gazette, and as an appendix to John Bartram’s Observations … In his Travels from Pensilvania To Onondago (London, 1751).  
  
Dear Sir.  
Albany the 2: of Septemb. 1750.  
After a pritty long journey made in a short time, I am come back to this town: you remember, Sir, that when I took leave of you, I told you, that if my time would permit, I would this summer take a view of Niagara fall, one of the greatest curieusities in the world. When I the last year came back from Canada, you did ask me several things about this fall; I told you all what I have heard of it in Canada of French Gentlemen, that had been there but it was yet all relata refero, I could not assure you of the truth of it, because I had not then seen it myself, and so it could not satisfy my own, much less your curieusitie. Now since I have myself seen it, it is in my power to give you a pritty sufficient description of this great curieusity in the world. After a fatigant travel, first horseback through your Six indians country to Oswego, and since from there in a battoe upon the Lake Ontario I came the 12th day of August in the evening to Niagara Fort: the French there were mighty perplexed at my first coming there, thinking I was an English Officer, that under pretext of Seing Niagara fall came there in some other view; but so soon I did shew them my Passports, they grew quite other men; they receiv’d me with the greatest civility. Niagara fall is six French leagues from Niagara Fort; you goes first 3. leagues by water up Niagara River; and since three leagues by land over the carrying-place. As it was late when I arriv’d at the Fort, I could not the same day go to the fall; but yet I did my business to prepare me to do it. The Commendant of the Fort, Monsieur Beaujeu, did call together all the Officers and Gentlemen there were to supper with him: I had read before most all the Authors, that have writ any thing about this fall; the last year in Canada I made thousand querries about it to several Gentlemen that has been at it, so that I had a pritty good knowledge of the fall. Here at the supper I begg’d the Gentlemen would tell me all what they knew and thought worth notice of this fall, which they all accordingly did; I observ’d that in great many thing they all did agree, but in some there were different opinions. All this I took very well notice of; since they had told me all what they thought they knew, I made several querries to them about what I had read and heard hereof, if a such or such thing is true; and I had upon all thei

e or not. Accordingly the next morning at the break of the day upon the 13th of August, I went to the fall. The Commendant had given order to two of the Officers of the Fort to go with me, to shew me every thing, and besides one of this two Officers had with him orders from the Commandant to Monsieur Joncaire, that had liv’d ten years by the carrying place, and did know every thing worth notice of the fall better than any Frenchman, indian or person in the world, to go with me and shew and tell me every thing he knew. A little before we came to the carrying place, the water of Niagara River grew so rapid, that four men in an [light?] Birch canoe had much work to get up to the carrying place. You can yet go with canoe half a League farther up the river than to the beginning of the carrying place though you have to work against the most rapid water; but higher up it is quite impossible to go in a canoe, being since nothing else to the great fall for two leagues and half of the river, than great many smaller falls one after the other, wherein the greatest battoe or canoe in a moment should be turn’d uppside down. We did since walk over the carrying place, having in the beginning besides the steep and high side of the river to step up two high steep hills, one after the other. Here upon the carrying place I saw above two hundred indians, most part of the six nations, busy in carrying packs of furrs, chiefly skins of Deers and bears over the carrying place: you would have been surpriz’d to see what abundance of such things are brought every day over this place: an indian gets 20 pences for every pack he carries over the carrying place, a distance of 3. leagues. Half an hour past 10. in the morning I came at the great fall, which I found such:  
The River runs here from SSE to NNW, and the great fall crosses it, though not in a right line, but forming almost a figure of an half Circle or horse-shoe. Above the fall in the middle of the river is an island that goes from SSE. to NNW. or parallel with the sides of the river, its length is about 7 or 8. French arpents (you must know, that an arpent is 120 feet long.) The lower end of this island is just at the perpendicular side of the fall. On both sides of this island runs all the water that comes from the Lakes of Canada viz. the upper Lake, Lake mischigan, Lake Huron, and lake Eriée: you knows, Sir, that all this Lakes are more small Seas than lakes. You can most every where see the Sun or rise or set in the water; besides this Lacs there are great many great rivers that empties their water in them, whereof the most part is coming down this Niagara fall. Before this water comes to this island, it runs but slowly, but so soon it is nigh the island, it grows to the most rapid water in the world, running with a surprizing swiftness before it comes to the fall; it is quite white, and in many places is thrown high up in the air; the greatest and strongest battoe would in a moment be turn’d here upside down. The water that goes down on the West side of the island is more rapid, in greater abundance, whiter, and seems almost to outdo an arrow in swiftness. When you is at the fall, and looks up the river, you can more than plainly see how the river above the fall is every where exceeding steep almost as the side of a hill. When all this water comes to the very fall, then it throws it self there down perpendiculair; the hairs will rise and stand upright upon your head, when you sees this; I can not with words express how amazing this is; you can not see it, without to be quite afraid, seing a such great quantity of water falling down perpendiculair to a surprizing hight. I suppose, Sir, you have a desire to know the very hight of this great fall: you know, Sir, that Father Hennepin made it 600. feet perpendiculair;but this good man has gain’d so very little Credit in Canada; the name of honour they there give him is, that they call him un grand Menteur, or a great Liar; he writes, he was in such and such places, where he yet never was. It is true, he has seen this fal

he Kings Ingenieur in Canada, which has measur’d it three times with mathematical instrument, told me, and gave me too with his own hand and name under the abovemention’d hight of 137. foot, and all the French Gentlemen, that now were present, with me, did agree with him, without the least contradiction. It is true, if, you will try to measure it with a line, you will sometimes find it 140, sometimes 150, sometimes yet more foot high, but the reason is, that you with a line not can come to any certitude of the hight the water carrying away the line, etc. When the water is come down to the bottom of the rock of the fall it jumps back to a very great height in the air; in other places it is white as a milk or snow and in such motion, as the water in a kettel, under which you have made the strongest fire. You remember, Sir, to what great distance Father Hennepin says that men can hear the noise of this fall: all the gentlemen, that were with me, did agree, that the furthest you can hear the noise of the fall is 15. leagues, and that very seldom. When it is quite calm, you can hear it to Niagara Fort, but seldom otherwise, because the waves of the lake Ontario otherwise makes a noise there by the shore. That they have observ’d at Niagara Fort, that when they hear there the noise of this fall louder than else, they are sure of a Nordeast wind, and that never fails, which is wonderfull when the fall is situated at SW. from the Fort, and rather should seem to be a sign to a contrary wind. Sometimes this fall makes a greater noise, than at other times, and when so is, it is a certain mark to an approaching bad weather or rain and this the indians here have allways for a sure sign. Now when I was here, it made not an extraordinary great noise; just by the fall I could very easily hear what the French did say to me, and they what I said to them, without that any of us did talk much louder, than we usually did when we were at any place where we heard no fall: I do not know how others have found here so great noise; may be at certain times, as abovemention’d. The Locusts in the trees just by the fall made three times greater and louder noise than all the fall. From the place, where the water falls down, it rises such abundance of vapors as the greatest and thickest smoak, though sometimes more, other times less; this vapors do rise high up in the air, when it is calm, but follows the wind, when it blows hard. If you goes nigh to this vapor or fog, or that the wind do drive him unto you it is so penetrating, that you in few minutes, will be so wet, as you had laid an hour under water: I let two young Frenchmen go down to bring from the side of the fall at the bottom all the several herbs, stones and shells they should find there; they came up in few minutes, and I really thought, that they had fallen into the water. They were oblig’d to strip themselves quite naked, and hang their cloats in the Sun to dry. When you is on the other or East side of Lake Ontario great many leagues from the fall, you can every clear and calm morning see the vapors of this fall rising in the air; you would think all the woods thereabout were set in fire of the indians; such is the smoake of the fall; in the same manner you can see the smoake of the fall on the West side of Lake Eriee great many leagues off. Several of the French Gentlemen told me, that when birds do come flying in this thick fog and smoake of the fall, they fall down and perish in the fall, either that their wings are grown to wet or that the noise of the fall makes them afraid, and that they don’t know where to go in the darkness, but others of the French gentlemen did not agree in that, and thought seldom or never any bird is perish’d here upon that manner, because they all did agree in that that among the great many birds which are found dead below the fall, you never shall find other, but such that live and swim chiefly in the water, as Ducks, gease, Swaans, water-hens, Teals. But therein did they French all agree that the most, if not all, birds, which perish here, are thrown in the fall in this manner, that they do swim in the river above the fall, and so they are carryed down lower and lower with the water, and you know, Sir, that Ducks and waterfowls commonly takes a great delight to be carryed with the stream and rapidness of the water; so here this birds permit themselves to be so long carryed down with the water, untill the swiftness of the water is so great, that it is not more possible for the birds to get up, but they are forced to follow the stream, and so thrown down the fall, perishing in this manner. Hundred times have the French seen great heaps of Ducks in the later end of the Summer been carryed down and thrown in the great fall, as now is said; you can see, that they try to get up of the water but can not. In the months of September and October they find every morning here such abundance of waterfowls below the fall at the shore that the garrison of the fort for a long time do live chiefly upon this. Besides the birds, they find sometimes Several sorts of dead fishes, Deers, bears, and other animals, that have tryed to cross the river above the fall; the greater animals you find chiefly all broken in pieces. Nighest below the fall is the water not rapid, but goes all in circles and whirls, almost as a boiling pot; the indians use to make there small canoes, and go there fishing; but a little lower begins the other smaller falls. When you is above the fall, and looks down, your head begins to turn Self. The French, that have hundred times been here, will seldom see down there, without keeping them fast at some tree with one hand. It has always been believed, that it was [not] possible for any body in the world to coome to the island, that is in the middle of the fall; But an accident that did happen 12 year ago, or therabout, has made it appear otherwise: the History is this: Two indians of the Six Nations went out from Niagara fort to hunt upon an island, that is in the middle of Niagara River some leagues above the great fall, and where it use to be abundance of Deers: they have got some French Brandy at Niagara Fort; this they tasted several times going over the carrying place; and when they there went into their canoe, they took sometimes a dram, and went so along up the river towards this island, where they were to hunt for deers; but they grew sleepy, and laid them down in the canoe to sleep. The canoe went farther and farther down with the water, so that he came nigh to that island, that is in the middle of the fall; here one of the indians got awake of the noise of the fall; he cries out to the other, that they were gone; yet they tryed, if possible, to save their live; this island was nighest, and with much working they got on shore there. They were in the beginning glad; but when they had consider’d every thing, they thought themselves hardly better, than to have gone down the fall, and so perish, because it was yet nothing to do for them, than to throw them in the fall, or to starve of hunger; but the necessity, that have been the beginning of several useful thing, made them try all: at the lower end of the island the rock of the fall is perpendiculair, and no water is running there; great woods is over all the island; they went there, and made stairs or ladders of bark of Lindtree, which they made so long, as they found they hight of the fall: one end of this ladder they did tie to a great tree, that grew at the side of the rock above the fall, and the other end the let fall down to the water; so they went down along their new invented stairs, and when they came to the bottom in the middle of the fall, they did rest a little, and as the water nighest below the fall is not rapid, as abovemention’d, they threw themselves out in the water thinking to swim on shore; but I have said before, that one fall is on one side of this island, and the other on the other; this makes that the waves of both falls running against one another, turns back against the rock, that is just under the island; therefore hardly had the indians come in the water, before the waves did throw them with violance against the rock, from whence they came; they tryed it several times, but grew at last weary, because of that the often were thrown against the rock; the rock had tored of the skin of their body in many places: they were then oblig’d to climb up their stairs again to the island, not knowing what to do; they perceived at length some Indians upon the shore, to which they cryed out; they indians did pity them, but did give them little hope of help, yet they made hast down to the Fort, told the Commandant where two of their Brothers were; the Commendant did persuade them in all manner to try to help this two poor indians, and it was done in this manner: the fall water, that runs on the East side of this island is shallow, especially a little above the island towards the Eastern shore; the Commandand let be made poles or sticks with iron at the end; two indians took upon them to walk to this island to save the other poor creatures, or to self perish; they took leave of all the others, as they were going to the death; every one had two such poles in his hands to set in the bottom of the Stream, to keep them steady; so the went along, and not alone came to the island, but returned back with the two poor indians, to which they have given some of their poles; these two indians that in the abovemention’d manner were first brought to this island are yet a life; they were 9. days upon the island, and were almost starved of hunger. Now since the road have been found out to this island, the indians often do go there to kill Deers, which have tryed to cross the river above the fall, but been so happy to have come upon this island, there carryed of the stream; they do increase there much, which makes the indians come there; but if the king of France would give me all Canada, I yet would not venture to go to this island, and I am sure, Sir, you would follow my example. On the West side of this island are some small islands or rocks of no consequence. The East side of the River is most perpendiculair, but the West side more slooping. In former times it was at that fall, which is on the West side of the island, a piece of a rock, that did hang over the rest, so that the water, that went thereover, and since fell perpendiculair, made that you could go under this rock between the perpendiculair side of the rock and the water, but this rock, that so hung out, is some year ago fallen down, that now it is nowhere any possibility to go between the falling water and the rock, but the water runs down all along the rock.  
The breadth of the fall, as it goes in a semicircle, is reckon’d to be about 6. arpents; the island is in the middle of the fall, and from it to every side is almost the same breadth; the breadth of the island at its lower end 2/3 arpent, or thereabout. Below the fall in the holes in the rocks are great plenty of Eales, which the indians and the French do catch only with their hands, without any other things; I sent two indian boys down, which directly came up with some and twenty fine eals. Every day when the Sun shines you sees here from 10 a clock in the morning to 2. a clock after noon, below the fall and under you, when you stands at the side over the fall, a fine Rain-bow, and sometimes two Rainbows, one on the outside of the other: I was so happy, that it was a fine clear day, when I was at this fall, and it was with some delight that I saw the rainbow, having allmost all the colours, which you find in a Rainbow in the air; the more vapours, the brighter and clearer is the rainbow; I saw it upon the East side of the fall at the bottom of the river above the water under the place where I stood; when the wind carries the vapours from that place, the rainbow is gone, and appears again so soon as new vapours come. From the fall to that place above the fall, where the canoes, that are coming from Lac Eriée put on shore, or from the fall to the upper end of the carrying place is half a English mile; lower they dare not go, of fear to be obliged to try the fate of the two indians, and that perhaps with less Success. They have often found below the fall pieces of human bodies perhaps of drunk indians, that unhappely had come down the fall. It was told me at Oswego, that in October or thereabout is such plenty of feathers to be found here below the fall, that a man in a day can gather thereof enough for several beds, which feathers are come of birds killed at the fall; I asked the French, if this was true: they answered, that they never have seen such thing; but if they will pluck the feathers of the dead birds, then they can have feathers for several beds. The French told me, that they often had thrown whole great thick trees in the river above the fall, and let them go down with the water, to see these trees since tumble down the fall; they have wit

be ſurpriz d to ſee what abundance of theſe  
things are brought every day over this place.  
An Indian gets 20 pence for ever pack he  
carries over, the diſtance being three leagues.  
Half an hour paſt 10 in the morning we came

Fall croſſes it, not in a right line; but form-  
ing almoſt the figure of a ſemicircle or horſe  
| ſhoe. Above the Fall, in the middle of the  
river is an iſland, lying alſo S. S. E. and  
N. N. W. or parallel with the ſides of the  
river; its length is about 7 or 8 french arpents  
(an arpent being 1 80 feet.) the lower end of  
this Hand is juſt at the perpendicular edge of  
the Fall. On both ſides of this iſland runs all  
the water that comes from the lakes of Canada,  
viz. Lake Superior, lake Miſchigan, lake  
Huron, and lake Erie, which you know are  
rather ſmall ſeas than lakes, and have beſides  
a great many large rivers that empty their  
water in them, of which the greateſt part comes  
down this Niagara Fall. Before the water  
comes to this iland, it runs but ſlowly, com-  
par&#x27;d with its motion when it approaches  
the iſland, where it grows the moſt rapid  
water in the World, runing with a ſurprizing  
-{wiftneſs before it comes to the Fall; it is  
quite white, and in many places is thrown

And very often great flocks of them are ſeen  
going to deſtruction in this manner: they ſwim  
in the river above the fall, and fo are carried  
down lower and lower by the water, and as  
 water-fowl commonly take great delight in  
being carry&#x27;d with the ſtream, ſo here they in-  
dulge themſelves in enjoying this pleaſure ſo  
long, till the ſwiftneſs of the water becomes ſo  
great, that tis no longer poſſible for them to  
riſe, but they are driven down the precipice,  
and periſh. They are obſery&#x27;d when _

they cannot. In the months of September and  
October, ſuch abundant quantities of dead wa-

Fall, on the ſhore, that the garriſon of the fort

they propos d to hunt; but growing ſleepy,

getting looſe drove back with the ſtream, far-  
ther and farther down till it came nigh that

one of them; awakened by the noiſe of the fall.  
cries out to the other, that they were gone!  
yet they try&#x27;d if poſſible to ſaveliſe. This iſland  
was nigheſt, and with much working they got  
on ſhore there. At firſt they were glad; but  
when they bad conſider d every thing, they  
thought themſelves hardly in a better ſtate  
than if they had gone down the fall, ſince they  
had now no other choice, than ei her to throw  
themſelves down the ſame, or to periſnh with  
hunger. But hard neceffity put them on in-  
vention. At the lower end of the iſland the  
rock is perpendicular, and no water is running  
there. This iſland has plenty of wood, they  
went to work directly and made a ladder or  
ſhrouds of the bark of lindentree, (which is  
very tough and ftrong, ) ſo long till they  
could with it reach the water below; one end  
of this bark ladder they tied faſt to a great  
tree that grew at the ſide of the rock a-

below the fall is not rapid, as beforementis

taracts running againſt each other, turn back  
againſt the rock that is juſt under the iſland,  
Therefore, hardly had the Indians began to  
ſwim, before the waves of the eddy threw

thing worth notice of the fall, better than  
any other perfon, to go with me, and  
fhow and tell me whatever he knew.  
A little before we came to the carrying-  
  
e, the water of Niagara river grew  
Pid, that 4 men in,a light birch  
canoe, had much work to get up thither.  
Canoes can go yet half a league above  
the beginning of the carrying-place,tho  
they muft work againit a water extremely  
rapid; buthigher up it is quite impofli-  
ble, the whole courle of the water, for  
2 leagues and a half,up to the great fall,  
being a feries of {maller falls, one ander  
another, in. which the greateft canoe or  
battoe would in a moment be turn’d up-  
fide down. We went afhore therefore,  
and walk’d over the carrying: place,  
having, befides the high and fteep fide  
of the river, 2 great hills to afcend one  
above theother. Hereon the carrying-  
  
  
  
ver. The water that goes down on the  
welt fide of the ifland, is more rapid, in  
greater abundance, whiter, and feems  
almoft to out-do an arrow in {wiftnels.  
  
hen you are at the fall, and look up  
the river, you may fee, that the river a-  
bove the fall is every where exceeding  
fteep, almoft as the fide of a hill. When  
al] this water comes to the very fall,  
there it throws itfelf down perpendicular!  
The hair will rife and ftand upright on  
your head, when you fee this! 1 can-  
not with words exprefs how amazing  
  
B thisis! You. cannot fee it without be-  
  
ing quite terrified ; to behold fo vaft a  
quantity of water falling abrupt from fo  
forprizing a height! 4 doubt not but  
you-have a delire to learn the exact  
height of this great fall. Father Henue-  
pin, you know, calls it * 600 feet per-  
pendicular; but he has gain’d little cre-  
  
place I faw above 200 Indians, moft of C dit in Canada ; the name of honour they  
  
chem belonging to the fix Nations, bufy  
in carrying yo a of furs, chiefly of deer  
and ber, over the carrying- place. You  
would be furpriz’d to fee what abun-  
dance of fuch things are brought every  
day over this place. An Indian gets 20  
pence for every pack he carries over,  
the diftance being 3 leagues. Half an  
hour paft 10 in the morning we came  
to the great fali, which I found as fol-  
lows. ;  
  
The river (or rather ftrait) runs here  
from S. S. E. to N. N. W. and the rock  
of the great fall croffes it, not in a right  
line, but forming almoit the figure of a  
femicircle or horfe-fhoe. Above the  
fall, in the middle of the river, is an  
ifland, lying alfo S.S.E. and N.N. W.  
or paralle] with the fides of the river ;  
jts length is about 7 or 8 French arpents  
(an arpent being 120 feet.) The lower  
end of this ifland is juft at the perpen-  
dicular edge of the fall. On both tides  
ef this ifland runs all the water that  
comes from the Lakes of Canada, viz.  
Lake Superior, Lake Mi/obigan, Lake  
Huron, and Lake Erie, which you know  
are rather {mall feas than lakes, and have  
befides a great many large rivers *hat  
empty their water into them, whereof  
the greateft part comes down this Nia-  
gara fall. Before the water comes to  
this ifland, it runs but flowly, compar’d  
with its motion when it approaches the  
ifland, where it grows the moit rapid  
water in the world, running with a  
furprizing fwiftnefs before it comes to  
the fall; it is quite white, and in many  
places is thrown high up into the air !

accident that happen’d 12 years ago, of  
thereabouts, made it appear otherwife.  
The hiftory is this. T&#x27;wo Indians of  
the Six Nations went out from Niagara  
fort, to hunt upon an ifland that is in  
the middle of the river, or ftrait, above  
the great fall, on which: there ufed to  
be abundance of deer. They took fome  
French brandy with them, from the  
  
fort, which they tafted feveral times as

they were going over the carrying-place;  
and when they were intheir canoe,they  
took now and then a dram, and fo went  
along up the ftrait towards the ifland  
where they propos’d to hunt; buat grow-  
ing fleepy, they laid themlelves down  
in the canoe, which getting loofe drove  
back with the fiream, farther and far-  
ther down till ic came nigh that ifland  
that is in the middle of the fall. Here  
one of them, awakéned by the noife of  
the fall, cries out to the other, that they  
were gone! Yer they tried if poflible  
to fave life. This band was nigheit,  
and with much working they got on  
fhore there. At firft they were glad;  
but when they had confider’d every  
thing, they thought themfelves hardly  
in a better ftate than if they had gone  
down the fall, fince they had now no  
other choice, than either to throw them-  
felves down the fame, or to perifh with  
hunger. But hard neceffity put them on  
invention. At the lower end of the if-  
land the rock is perpendicular, and no  
water is running there. The ifland has  
plenty of wood; they went to work  
then, and made a ladder or fhrouds of

in fome things they were of different

tne next Morning, being the 13%h of  
Auguf?, at Break of Day, I fet out for  
the Fall: The Commandant had given  
Orders to two of the Officers of the  
Fort to go with me and fhew me every  
thing; and moreover, fent by them an  
Order to M. Foncaire, who had lived  
ten Years by the Carrying-place, and  
knew every thing worth Notice of the  
Fall, better than any other Perfon, to

quite impoilibie, the whole Courfe of the  
Water, for two Leagues and a half up  
  
‘to the great Fall, being a Series of  
  
froaller. k&#x27;alls, one under another, in  
which the greateft Canoe or Battoe  
would in a Moment be turned up fide  
down. We went afhore therefore, and  
walk’d over the Carrying place, having,  
befides the high and itteep Side of the  
River, two great Hills to afcend one  
above the other. Here, on the Carry-  
ing place, I faw above 200 Indians,  
moft of them belonging to the fx Na-  
tions, bufy in carrying Packs of &gt; Furs,  
chiefly of Deer and Bear, over the Car-  
rying-place. You would be furprized  
to fee what abundance of fuch Things  
are brought every Day over this Place.  
An Indian gets is. 8d, for every Pack  
he carries over, the Diftance being three  
Leagues. Half an Hour paft ‘l’en in  
the Morning we came to the great  
Fall, which I found as follows.  
  
The River (or rather Strait) runs  
here from S.S. E. to N. N W. and the  
Rock of the great Fall croffes it, not in  
a right Line, but forming almoft the  
Figure of a Semicircle or Horfe fhoe.  
Above the Fall, in the Middle of the  
River, is an Iiland, lying alfo S.S. E.  
and N. N.W. or parallel with the Sides  
of the River; its length is about feven  
or eight Freuch Arpents, (an Arpent be-  
ing 120 Feet.) The lower End of this  
Tfland is juft at the perpendicular Edge  
of the Fall. On boti Sides of this  
Ifland runs -all the-Water-that comes  
from the Lakes of Canada, viz. Lake  
Superior, Lake Mijohigan, Lake Huren,  
and Lake Erie; which you know are  
rather {mall Seas than Lakes, and have  
befides a great many large Rivers that  
empty their Waters into them, whereof  
the greaieit Part comes down this Nia-  
gara Fall. Before the Water comes to  
this Ifland, it runs but flowly, compared  
with its Motion when it approaches the  
Ifland, where it grows the moft rapid  
Water in the World, running with a  
furprizing Swiftnefs before it comes to  
the Pall; it is quite white, and in many  
  
over. The Water that goes down on  
the Weft Side of the Ifland, is more ra-  
pid, in greater abundance, whiter, and  
feems almof to out-do an Arrow in  
Swiftnefs, When you are at the Fall,  
and look up the River, you may fee,  
that the River above the Fall is every  
where exceeding fteep, almoft as the  
Side of a Hill. When all this Water  
comes to the very Fall, there it throws  
itfelf down perpendicular! The Hair  
will rife and ftand upright on your  
Head, when you fee this! I cannot  
with Words exprefs how amazing this  
is! You cannot fee it without bein  
  
quite terrified; to behold fo vaft a  
Quantity of Water falling abrupt from  
fo furprizing a Height! I doubt not but  
you have a Defire to learn the exaé&amp;  
Height of this great Fail. Father Hen-  
nepin [and Pepple’s Map] calls it 600  
Feet perpendicular; but he has gained  
little Credit in Canada; the Name of  
Honour they give him there, is us  
grand Menteur, or the great Liar; he  
writes of what he faw in Places where  
he never was, °Tis true he faw this  
Fall: But as it is the Way of fome Tra-

who have meafured it with Mathema-  
tical Inftruments, find the perpendicu-  
Jar Fall of the Water to be exaétly 137  
Feet. M. Morandrien, the King’s En-  
gineer in Canada, told me, and gave it  
me alfo under his Hand, that 137 Feet  
was precifely the Height of it; and alk  
the French Gentlemen that were  
  
wit  
  
  
  
16 The GENERAL  
  
with me at the Fall, did agree with  
him, without the leaft Contradi¢tion :  
It is true, thofe that have tried to mea-  
fure it with a Line, find it fometimes  
140, fometimes 150 Feet, and fome-  
times more ; but the Reafon is, it can-  
not that way be meafured with any Cer-  
tainty, the Water carrying away the  
Line.—When the Water is come down  
to the Bottom of the Rock of the Fall,  
it jumps back to a very great Height in  
the Air; in other Places itis as white as  
Milk or Snow; and all in Motion  
like a boiling Cauldron.  
  
You may remember to what a great  
Diftance Hennepin {ays the Noife of this  
Fall may be heard. All the Gentlemen  
who were with me, agreed, that the  
fartheft one can hear it, is 15 Leagues,  
and that very feldom. When the Air  
is quite calm, you can hear it at Nia-  
gara Fort, fix Leagues ; but feldom at  
other Times, becaufe, when the Wind  
blows, the Waves of Lake Oxtario  
make too much Noife there againft the  
Shore. They inform’d me, that when  
they hear at the Fort the Noife of the  
Fall, louder than ordinary, they are  
fure a North Eaft Wind will follow,  
which never fails: This feems wonder-  
ful, as the Fall is South Weft from the  
Fort: and one would imagine it to be  
rather a Sign of a contrary Wind.  
Sometimes, *tis faid, the Fall makes a  
much greater Noife than at other Times ;  
and this is look’d on as a certain Mark  
of approaching bad Weather or Rain;  
the /ndians here hold it always for a fure  
Sign. When I was there, it did not  
make an extraordinary great Noife:  
Juft by the Fall, we could eafily hear  
what each other faid, without {peaking  
much louder than common, when con-  
verfing in other Places. 1 donot know  
how others have found fo great a Noife  
here; perhaps it was at certain Times,  
as above mentioned. From the Place  
where the Water falls, there rifes a-  
bundance of Vapaurs, like the greateft  
and thickeft Smoak, tho’ fometimes  
more, fometimes leis: Thefe Vapours  
rile high in the Air when it is calm,

but are difperfed by the Wind when it  
blows hard. If you go nigh to this  
Vapour or Fog, or if the Wind blows  
it on you, it is fo penetrating, thatin a  
few Minutes you will be as wet as if  
you had been under Water. I got two  
young Frenchmen to go down, to bring  
me, from the Side of the Fall, at the  
Bottom, fome of each of the feveral  
kinds of Herbs, Stones, and Shells,  
they fhould find there; they return’d  
in a few Minutes, and I really thought  
they had fallen into the Water: They  
were obliged to ftrip themfelves quite  
naked, and hang their Cloaths in the  
Sun to dry. When you are on the  
other, or Eaft Side of Lake Oxztario, a  
great many Leagues from the Fall, you  
may, every clear and calm Morning,  
fee the Vapours of the Fall rifing in the  
Air; you would think all the Woods  
thereabouts were fet on Fire by the Zz-  
dians, {o great is the apparent Smoak,  
In the fame Manner you may fee it on  
the Weft Side of Lake Eric, a great many  
Leagues off. Several of the French  
Gentlemen told me, that when Birds  
come flying into this Fog or Smoak of  
the Fall, they fall down and perifh in  
the Water, either becaufe their Wings  
are become wet, or that the Noife of  
the Fail aftonifhes them, and they know  
not where to go in the Darknefs: But  
others were of Opinion, that feldom or  
never any Bird perifhes there in that  
Manner: becaufe, as they all agreed,  
among the abundance of Birds found  
dead below the Fall, there are no other —  
forts than fuch as live and {wim fre-  
— in the Water; as Swans, Geefe,  
acks, Water-hens, Teal, and the like.

they are driven down the Precipice  
and perifh. They are obferved when  
they draw nigh the Fall, to endeavour  
with all their Might to take Wing and  
leave the Water; but they cannot. In  
the Months of September ard O@ober,  
{uch abundant Quantities of dead Wa.  
ter Fowl are found every Morning be-  
low the Fall, on the Shore, that the  
Garrifon of the Fort for a long Time  
live chiefly upon them. Befides the  
Fowl, they find alfo feveral forts of  
dead Fith, alfo Deer, Bears, and other  
Animals which have tried to crofs the  
Water above the Fall; the larger Ani-  
mals are generally found broken to  
Pieces, juft below, a little Way from  
the Fall. The Water is not rapid, but  
goes all in Circles, and whirls like a  
boiling Pot; which, however, does  
not hinder the Jzdians going upon it in  
{mall Canoes a Fifhing; but a little  
further, and lower, begin the other  
{maller Falls. When you are above the  
Fall, and look down, your Head be-  
gins to turn. The French, who have  
been here a hundred Times, will feldom  
venture to look down without, at the  
fame Time, keeping faft hold of fome  
Tree with one Hand.  
  
It was formerly thought impoflible  
for any Body living to come at the Ifland  
that is in the Middle of the Fall: But  
an Accident that happened 12 Years  
ago, or thereabovts, made it appear  
  
otherwife. The Hiftory is this. T&#x27;wo_  
  
Indians of the Six Nations went out  
from Niagara Fort, to hunt upon an  
Tfland that is in the Middle of the Ri-  
ver or Strait, above the great Fall, on  
which there ufed to be abundance of  
Deer. They took fome French Brandy  
with them, from the Fort, which they  
tafted {everal Times as they were going  
over the Carrying place; and when  
they were in their Canoe, they took  
now andthen a Dram, and fo went  
along up the Strait, towards the Ifland,  
where they propofed to hunt; but  
growing fleepy, they laid themfelves  
  
down in the Canoe, which getting loofe,  
drove back with the Stream, farther

and farther down till it came nigh that  
Ifland in the Middle of the Fall. Here  
onc of them, awakened by the Noife of  
the Fall, cries out to the other, that they  
were gone! Yet they tried, if poffible,  
to fave Life. This Ifland was nigheft,  
and, with much working, they got on  
Shore there. At firlt they were glad;  
bur when they had confidered every  
Thing, they thought themfelves hardly  
in a better State than if they had gone  
down thé Fall, fince they had now no  
other Choice, than either to throw them-  
felves down the fame, or to perifh with  
Hunger. But hard Neceffity put them  
on Invention. At the lower End of the  
Ifland the Rock is perpendicular, and  
no Water is runningthere. The Ifland  
has plenty of Wood; they went to  
work then, and made a Ladder or  
Shrouds of the Bark of a Lind Tree,  
(which is very tough and ftrong) fo long  
ull they could, with it, reach the  
Water below; one End of this Bark  
Ladder they tied faft to a great Tree  
that grew at the Side of the Rock, a-  
bove the Fall, and let the other End  
down to the Water: So they went  
down their new invented Stairs, and  
when they came to the Bottom, in the  
Middle of the Fall, they refted a little ;  
and asthe Water next below the Fall  
is not rapid, as before mentioned, they  
then threw themfelves out into it,  
thinking to fwim on Shore. I have  
faid before, that one Part of the Fall  
is on one Side of the Ifland, the other  
on the other Side. Hence it is, that  
the Waters of the two Cataraéts, run-  
ning againft each other, turn back  
againft the Rock that is juft under the  
Ifland. Therefore, hardly had the  
Indians begun to fwim, before the  
Waves of the Eddy threw them with  
Violence againft the Rock from whence  
they came. ‘They tried it feveral ‘Times,  
but at laft grew weary, and being often  
thrown againft the Rock, they were  
much bruifed, and the Skin torn off  
their Bodies in many Places. So they  
were obliged to climb up their Stairs a-

A little before we came to the Carrying-  
place, the water grew fo rapid, that four  
men, in a light canoe, had much difficulty  
to get up thither. Canoes can go half a  
league above the beginning of the Carrying-  
place, though they muft labour againft a  
ftream extremely rapid; but, higher up, it  
is quite impoffible, the whole courfe of the  
river, for two leagues and a half below the  
great fali, being a feries of finaller falls, one  
under another, in which the greateft canoe  
or battoe would, in a moment, be turned  
upfide down. We therefore went afhore,  
and walked over the Carrying-place, having,  
befides the high and fteep fides of the river,  
two great hills to afcend one above another.  
  
On this Carrying-place I faw above two  
hundred Indians, moft of them belongirg  
to the Six Nations, bufy in carrying packs  
of furs, chiefly of deer and bears, over the  
Carrying-place. It is furprifing to fee what  
quantities of thefe goods are brought every  
  
day  
  
  
  
  
  
day  
has

@ay over this Carrying-place. An Indian  
has twenty pence for every pack he cariies  
over; and he dearly earns it, for the di-  
{tance is nearly three leagues.  
  
We arrived at the great fall about ten in  
the morning, and, the weather being very  
fine, I had an opportunity of furveying very  
attentively this furprifing cataract of nature.  
  
The courfe of the river, or rather ftreight,  
is, here, from S. S. E. to N. N. W. and  
the rocks of the great fall crofs it, not in a  
right-line, but forming an arch little lefs  
than a femicircle. Above the fall, in the  
middle of the river is an ifland, lying alfo  
S.S. E. and N.N. W, or parallel with  
thé fides of the river ; its length is about  
four hundred and twenty yards. The lower  
end of this ifland is juft at the perpendicular  
edge of the fall. On both fides of this  
ifland runs all the water that comes from  
the lakes of Canada, viz. Lake Superior,  
Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake  
Errie; which are, indeed, rather feas than  
lakes, and have, befides, a great many large  
rivers that .difcharge their waters into them,  
of which the greateft part comes down the  
Niagara fall. Before the water comes to  
the ifland, it runs but flowly, compared with  
its motion when it approaches the ifland,  
where it becomes the moft rapid water in  
the world, running with a furprifing {wift-  
nefs, before it comes to the fall ; it is quite  
white, and, in many places, is thrown high  
into the air. The greateft and ftrongett  
boats would here, in a moment, be overtet.  
The water that runs along the weit fide of  
the ifland is more rapid, in greater abun-  
dance, and whiter than that which runs on  
the eaft fide, appearing almoft to exceed an  
arrow in {wiftnefs.  
  
When you are at the fall, and look up the  
river, you may fee that the river above the  
fall is every-where exceeding tteep, refem-  
bling the fide of a hill. When this prodi-  
gious body of water comes to the very fall,  
it throws itfelf down in a perpendicular di

without the leaft exaegeration; and it muft  
be confefled that nature does not ftand in  
need of fictitious reiations, to excite our ad-  
miration, and force us to confefs, that no-  
thing lefs than an Almighty hand, guided  
by infinite wifdom, could have produced  
thofe furprifing objeéts that inceflantly fur-  
round us.  
  
But, notwithftanding what Father Hen-  
nepin has afferted, the height of this famous  
fall has been found to be exactly 137 feet.  
  
When the watcr is come down to the  
bottom of the rock of the fall, it jumps  
back to a great height in the air; in other  
places it is as white as milk or fnow, aad  
all in motion like a boiling caldron.  
  
The noife of this fall in fine weather may  
be heard at fifteen leagues diltance. Andy  
when the wind is very calm, you may hear  
itat Niagara fort; but feldam at other times,  
  
ecaufe, when the wind blows, the waves of  
the lake Ontario make too much noife there  
againit the fhore. And it is very remark-  
able, that, when they hear the noife of the  
fall at the above fort, more plain than ordi-  
nary, they are fure a north-eaft wind will  
follow ; this is really furprifing, as the fall  
is fouth-weft from the fort ; and one would  
imagine it fhould rather be a fign of a con-  
trary wind.  
  
From the place where the water falls, there  
rifes abundance of vapours, reiembling a  
prodigious thick fmoke. Thefe vapours rile  
2 great height in the air when it is calm, but  
are difperied by the wind when it blows  
hard. If you go into this vapour or fog, ox  
if the wind blows it on you, it is fo pene-  
trating, that in a few minutes you will be  
as wet as if you had been under water. I  
defired two of the Gentlemen who went  
with me, to go down to bring me, from the  
fide at the bottom of the fail, fome of the  
feveral kinds of herbs, ftones, and fhells,  
they could find there. ‘They immediately  
went down the fall, but when they returned,  
which was not many minutes, they were fo  
wet, that I really thought they had acciden-  
tally fallen into the water, and ‘ere obliged  
to {trip themfelves quite naked, and hang  
their cloaths in the jun to dry.  
  
When you are on the other fide of the  
lake Ontario, though a great many leagues  
from the fall, you may, every clear and  
calm morning, fee the vapours of the fall  
rifing in the air; aud a perion, wauied to

It was formerly looked upon as impofli-  
ble for any body to go a-fhore on the ifland  
and return again ; but an accident that hap-  
pened about feventecn years ago, proved  
that this opinion was ill founded. The

tions went from Nizgara fort, to hunt on an  
Hiand ia the middie of the river or ftreight,

be plenty of deer. They took fome French  
brandy with them, from the fort, which  
they tafted feveral times, as they were going  
over the Carrying-place ; and, when they  
were in the canoe, they did the fame thing, as  
they rowed up the ftreight, towards the ifland  
where they propofed to hunt ; but, grewing  
fleepy, they laid themielves down in the ca~  
noe, which, getting loofe, drove back with  
the ftream, farther and farther down, till  
they came near that ifland, which lies in the  
middle of that fall. Here one of them,  
awakened by the noife of the cataract, cried  
cut to the other, that they were loft! They  
tried, however, to fave their lives ; and, this  
ifland being nearett, they, with the utmott

Formerly a part of the rock at the fall,  
which is on the weft fide of the ifland, hung  
over in fuch a manner, that the water, which  
fell perpendicularly from it, left a vacancy  
below, fo that there was a paflage at the  
bottom of the fall between the rock and the  
water ; but fome years ago the prominent  
part broke off, and fell down, fo that now  
there is no poflibility of going between the  
falling water and the rock, the former  
touching the latter from the upper part to  
the bottom of the fall.  
  
The breadth of the fall, as it forms a f-  
micircle, is reckoned to be about three hun-  
dred and fixty yards. The ifland is in the  
middle of the fall, and about forty yards  
broad at its lower end.  
  
Every day, when the fun fhines, from ten  
o&#x27;clock in the morning, until two in the af-  
ternoon, below the fall, and under you,  
when you ftand at the fide over the fall, you  
fee a glorious rainbow, and fometimes two  
one within another. I was fo fortunate as to  
be at the fall on a fine clear day, and contem-  
plated with great delight this beautiful pha-  
nomenon, which was einbellifhed with thofe  
brilliant colours confpicuous in the rainbow  
formed in the air. When the wind carries  
the vapours from place to place, the rain-  
bow is often invifible, but becomes confpi-  
cuous, as fecn as new vapours are formed.  
  
From the fall to the landing-place, where  
the canoes from lake Errie put on fore (or  
from the fall to the upper end of the Car-  
rying- place) is half a mile. Lower than  
this the canoes dare not come, leit they  
  
fhould be obliged to try the fate of the twe  
Indians above-mentioned, and perhaps with  
lefs fuccefs.

to the Bottom it jumps back to a very great Height; is as white  
as Milk, and all in motion like a boiling Cauldron ; when the Air  
is quite cAim, you can hear it at the Diſtance of ſix Leagues.  
  
It was formerly thought impoſſible for any Body living to come  
At this Iſland ; but an Accident that happened 12 Youre ago, made  
it appear otherwiſe, The Hiſtory is this. Two Indians of the Six  
Nations went out from Niagara Fort, to hunt upon an Iſland that  
is in the Middle of the River or Strait, above the great Fall, on  
which there uſed to be Abundance of Deer. They took ſome  
French Brandy with them, from the Fort, which they taſted ſeveral  
Times as they were going over the Carrying-Place, and when they  
were in their canoe, they took now-and-then a Dram, and ſo went  
along up the Strait, towards the Iſland ; where they propoſed to  
  
  
noe, which getting looſe, drove back with the Stream, farther and  
  
  
them, awakened by the Noiſe of the Fall, cries out to the other,  
that they were gone! Yet they tried, if poſſible, to ſave life.  
This Ifland was nigheſt, and, with much working, they got on  
Shore there. At firſt they were glad; but when they had conſider-  
ed every Thing, they thought themſelves hardly in a better State  
than if they had gone down the Fall, ſince they had now no other  
choice, than either to throw themſelves down, or periſh with hun-  
ger. But hard Neceſſity put them on Invention. At the lower End  
of the Iſland the Rock is Perpendicular, and no water is running  
there. The Iſland has Plenty of Wood; they went to work, and  
made a Ladder or Shrouds of the Bark of a Lind Tree, (which is  
very tough and ſtrong) fo long till they could, with it, reach the  
Water below; one End of this Bark Ladder they tied faſt to a great  
Tree that grew at the Side of the Rock, above the Fall, and let  
the other End down to the Water: So they went down their new  
invented Stairs, and when they came to the Bottom, in the Middle  
of the Fall, they reſted a little ; and as the Water next below the  
Fall is not rapid, as before-mentioned, they then threw themſelves

Violence againſt the Rock. They tried ſeveral Times, but at laſt  
grew weary, and being often thrown againſt the Rock, and much  
bruiſed, were obliged to climb up their Stairs again to the Iſland.  
After ſome time they perceived Indians on the Shore, to whom  
they cried out. &quot;Theſe ſaw and pitied them, but gave them little  
Hope of Help: Yet they made haſte down to the Fort, and told  
the Commandant where two of their Brothers were. He perſuad-

and it was done in this manner. The Water that runs on this Side

their Friends, as if they were going to Death. Each had two ſuch

A little betbre we came to the carry¬

lie dearly earns it, tor the didance is  
nearly three leagues.  
  
We arrived at the great fall about ten

Above the fall, in the middle of the

420 yards. ‘The lowerend of this ifl-

rather feas thanlakes ; and have, be-

which the greate(t part comes down

but it is the common practice of fome  
travellers to magnify every thing;  
and this the good father has done :  
for the height of this famous fall has  
been found to be exactly 137 feet.  
  
When the water is come down to

really furprifing, asthe fall is fouth  
weft from the fort; and one would  
imagine it fhould rather be a contrary  
wind.  
  
From the place where the water  
falls, there rifes abundance of vapours,  
refembling a prodigious thick {moke.  
Thefe vapours rife a great height in the  
  
?  
  
air when it is calm, but are difperfed  
  
by the wind when it blows hard. If  
  
you go into this vapour or fog, or if  
  
the wind blows it on you, it is fo pe-  
  
netrating, that in a few minuites you  
  
will beas wet as if you had been un-  
  
der water. I defired two of the gen-  
Vol. IT. OF. 1790. 4B  
  
tlemen who went with me, to go down  
to bring me, from the fide at the bot-  
tom of the fall, fome of the feveral  
kinds of herbs, ftones, and fhells, they  
could find there. They immediately  
went down the fall; but when they  
returned,which was not many minutes,  
they were fo wet, that I really thought  
they had accidentally fallen into the  
water, as they were obliged to ftrip  
themielves quite naked, and hang their  
clothes in the fun to dry.  
  
When you are on the other fide of  
the lake Ontario, though a great many  
leagues from the fall, you may, every  
clear and calm morning, fee the va-  
pours of the fall rifingin the air ; and  
a perfon unufed to this phenomenon,  
would be tempted to think that allthe  
forefts thereabouts were on fire, fo  
great is the apparent fincke. In the  
Jike manner you may fee it on the weit  
fide of the lake Erie, a great many  
leagues off.

It was formerly looked upon as im-  
poffible for any body to go afhore on  
the ifland, and return again ; but an  
accident that happened about twenty  
five years ago, proved that this opin-  
ion was ill founded. The hiftory is  
this : Two Indians of the Six Nations  
went from Niagara fort, to hunt onan  
iand in the middle of the river or  
itrait, above the great fall, on which  
there ufed to be plenty of deer. They  
took fome French brandy with them,  
from the fort, which they tafted feve-  
ral times, as they were going over the  
carrying place ; and, wher they were  
in the canoe, they did the fame thing  
as they rowed up the ftrait, to-  
wards the ifland where they propofed  
  
to hunt ; but, growing fleepy, they,  
  
Jaid themfelves down inthe canoe,  
which getting loofe, drove back with  
the ftream, farther and farther down,  
till they came near that ifland which

Formerly a part of the rock at the  
fall, which is on the weft fide of the i-  
fland, hung over in fuch a manner,  
that the water which fell perpendicu-  
larly from it left a vacancy below, fo  
that there was a paflage at the bottom  
of the fall between the rock and the  
water ; but fome years ago the prom-  
inent part broke off, and fell down;  
fo that now there is no poflibility of  
going between the falling water and

the rock, the former touching the lat-  
ter from the upper part to the bottom  
ofthe fall. ‘Lhe breadth of the fall  
as it forms a femicircle, is reckoned to  
be about 360 yards. ‘The iiland is in  
the middle of the fall, and about 40  
yards broad at its lower end.  
  
Every day, when the fun fhines,  
from ten inthe morning until two in  
the afternoon, below the fall, and un-  
der you, when you ftand at the fide  
over the fall, you fee a glorious rain-  
bow, and fonietimes two, one within  
another. Iwas fo fortunate as to be at  
the fall on a fine clear day, and con-  
templated with great delight this beau-  
tiful phenomenon, which was embel-  
lithed with thofe brilliant colours con-  
fpicuous in the rainbow formed in  
the air. When the wind carries the  
vapours from place to place, the rain-  
bow is often invifible, but becomes  
confpicuous as foon as new vapours  
are formed.

every circumstance relative to it.  
  
A little before we came to the carry-  
ing place, the water grew so rapid that  
four men in a light canoe had much dif-  
ficulty.to get up thither. Canoes can go  
half a league above the beginning of the  
carrying place, tho’ they must labour  
against a stream extremely rapid, but  
higher up it is quite impossible, the  
whole course of the river, for two leagues  
and a half below the great fall being a  
series of smaller falls, one under an-  
Qther, on which the greatest canoe or  
batteau would in a moment be turned  
upside down. We therefore went ashore  
and walked over the carrying place, hav-  
ing, besides the high and steep sides of  
the river, two great hills to ascend, one  
above another.  
  
We arrived at the great fall about ten  
in the morning, and the weather being  
very fine, I had an opportunity of sur-  
veying very attentively this surprising  
cataract of nature.  
  
The course of the river, or rather  
strait, is here from S.S.E. to N.N.W.,  
and the rocks of the great fall cross it,  
not in a right line, but forming an arch  
little less than a semicircle. Above the  
fall, in the middle of the river, is an  
island, lying also S.S.E. and N.N.W., or  
parallel with the sides of the river; its  
length is about 420 yards. The lower  
end of this island is just at the perpen-  
dicular edge of the fall. On both sides  
  
49  
  
of this island runs all the water that  
comes from the lakes of Canada, viz.:  
Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake  
Huron and Lake Erie; which are in-  
deed rather seas than lakes, and have,  
besides, a great many large rivers that  
discharge their waters into them, of  
which the greatest part comes down  
Niagara fall. Before the water comes  
to the island it runs but slowly compared  
with its motion when it approaches the  
island, where it becomes the most rapid  
water in the world, running with a sur-  
prising swiftness. Before it comes to  
the fall it is quite white, and in many  
places it is thrown high into the air.  
The greatest and strongest boats would  
here in a moment be overset. The water  
that runs along the west side of the  
island is more rapid, in greater abun-  
dance and whiter than that which runs  
on the east side, appearing almost to ex-  
ceed an arrow in swiftness,  
  
When you are at the fall and look up  
the river, you may see the river above  
the fall is everywhere exceeding steep,  
resembling the side of ahill. When this  
prodigious body of water comes to very  
fall it throws itself down in a perpen-  
dicular direction. But the surprise o

indeed visit this famous fall; but it is  
the common practice of some travellers  
to magnify everything, and this the good  
father has done, for the height of this  
famous fall has been found to be exactly  
137 feet.  
  
When the water is come down to the  
bottom of the rock of the fall it jumps  
back to a great height in the air; in  
other places it is as white as milk or snow,  
and all in motion like a boiling caldron.  
  
The noise of this fall in fine weather  
may be heard at fifteen leagues distance,  
and, when the wind is very calm, you  
may hear it at Niagara Fort ; but seldom  
  
at other times ; because when the wind -  
  
blows, the waves of the lake Ontario  
make too much noise against the shore.  
And it is very remarkable, that, when  
they hear the noise of the fall at the  
above fort more plain than ordinary,  
they are sure a north-east wind will fol-  
low. This is really surprising, as the  
fall is south-west from the fort, and one  
would imagine it should rather be a con-  
trary wind.  
  
From the place where the water falls,  
there rises abundance of vapours, re-  
sembling a prodigious thick smoke.  
These vapours rise a great height in the  
air when itis calm, but are dispersed by  
the wind when it blows hard. If you  
go into this vapour or fog, or if the wind  
blows it on you, it is so penetrating,  
that in a few minutes you will be as wet  
as if you had been under water. I de-  
sired two of the gentlemen who went  
with me to go down to bring me, from the  
side at the bottom of the fall, some of the  
several kinds of herbs, stones, and shells,  
they could find there. They immedi-  
ately went down the fall; but when  
  
REPRINTS  
  
they returned, which was not many  
minutes, they were so wet, that I really  
thought they had accidentally fallen  
into the water, as they were obliged to  
strip themselves quite naked, and hang  
their clothes in the sun to dry.  
  
When you are on the other side of the  
lake Ontario, though a great many  
leagues from the fall, you may, every  
clear and calm morning, see the vapours  
of the fall rising in the air, and a person  
unused to this phenomenon would be  
tempted to think that all the forests  
thereabouts were on fire, so great is the  
apparent smoke. In the like manner  
you may see it on the west side of the  
Lake Erie, a great many leagues off.  
  
The Indians say that when birds  
come flying into this fog or smoke of  
the cataract, they fall down, and perish  
in the water, either because their wings  
are wet, or that the noise of the fall  
astonishes them, and they know not  
which way to fly, the light being ex-  
cluded by the vapours. But those who  
accompanied me were of opinion that  
seldom or never any bird perishes there  
in that manner; because, among all the  
birds found dead below the cataract,  
there are no other sorts than such as  
live, or at least frequently swim in the  
water, as swans, geese, ducks, waterhens,  
teal and the like. And very often large  
flocks of them are seen going to destruc-  
tion in this manner; they swim in the  
river above the fall, and so are carried  
down lower and lower by the water ;  
and as water fowl commonly take great  
delight in being carried with the stream,  
so will they indulge themselves in enjoy-  
ing this pleasure so long till the swift-  
ness of the water becomes so great, that  
  
  
  
REPRINTS  
  
it is no longer possible for them to rise,  
but they are driven down the precipice  
_ and perish, They are observed, when  
they draw near the fall, to endeavour  
with all their might, to take wing, and  
leave the water, but find it impossible.  
In the months of September and Octo-  
ber, such quantities of dead water fow

broken to pieces. Just below the fall  
the water is not rapid, but: goes all in  
circles and eddies like a boiling pot,  
  
which however, does not hinder the In-  
dians from going a-fishing on it in small  
  
canoes. When you are above the fall,  
and look down, your head begins to turn,  
nor will those who have often visited it  
seldom venture to look down, without  
holding fast to some tree.  
  
It was formerly looked upon as impos-  
sible for anybody to go ashore on the  
island, and return again;. but an acci-  
dent that happened about twenty-five  
years ago proved that this opinion was  
ill-founded. The history is this: Two  
Indians of the Six Nations went from  
Niagara Fort to hunt on an island in  
the middle of ‘the river or strait,  
above the great fall, on which there  
used to be plenty of deer. They took  
some French brandy with them from the  
fort, which they tasted several times as  
they were going over the carrying place,  
and when they were in the canoe they  
did the same thing as they rowed up the  
strait towards the island where they pro-  
  
51  
  
posed to hunt; but growing sleepy they  
laid themselves down in the canoe,  
which getting loose drove back with the  
stream, farther and farther down, till  
they came near that island which lies in  
the middle of the fall. Here one of  
them, awakened by the noise of the  
cataract, cried out to the other that  
they were lost! They tried, however,  
to save their lives, and this island being  
nearest, they with the utmost difficulty  
got ashore there. They were at first  
greatly rejoiced, but when they had seri-  
ously reflected on their condition, they  
believed themselves hardly in a better  
state than if they had been precipitated  
down the fall, as they had no other  
choice than either to throw themselves  
down that precipice or perish with hun-  
ger. But necessity is the mother of in-  
vention. At the lower end of the island  
the rock is perpendicular, and no water  
runs there, and the island abounding  
with ‘wood, they went immediately to  
work and made a kind of ladder of the  
bark of the linden tree, long enough to  
reach the surface of the water at the  
bottom of the precipice. One end of  
this ladder they fastened to a large tree  
that grew at the side of the rock above  
the fall, and let the other end down to  
the water. Being thus fixed they went  
down their new invented stairs to the  
surface of the water, in the middle of  
the fall, where they rested a little time;  
and as the water next below the fall is  
not rapid, they threw themselves into  
it, hoping to reach the shore by swim-  
ming. I have said before, that that one  
part of the fall is on this and the other  
on that side of the island, and hence it  
is that the waters of each turn back  
against the rock that is just under the  
  
  
  
  
  
52  
  
island. The Indians therefore had hardly  
began to swim before the waves of the  
eddy threw them with violence against  
the rock from whence they came.  
  
They tried it several times, but were  
always ‘hrown against the rock, so that  
they were obliged to climb up the stairs  
again to the island, not knowing what  
todo. After some time they perceived  
some of their countrymen, to whom they  
cried out. They saw and pitied them;  
but gave them little hopes of help. They  
however hasted to the fort, and told the  
commander the dismal situation of their  
two brethren. He persuaded them to  
try all possible means of relieving the  
poor Indians, which at last they effected  
in the following manner: The water  
  
that runs on the east side of this island  
is shallow, especially a little above the  
  
island, towards the eastern shore. The  
commandant having caused poles to be  
made and pointed with iron, two Indi-  
ans determined to walk to the island by  
the help of these poles, in order to save  
the other poor creatures or perish in the  
attempt. Accordingly, before they made  
the attempt, they took leave of all their  
friends, as if they were going to inevit-  
able death. Each of the Indians car-  
ried two of the above poles, one of which  
they fixed firmly in the river, and by  
that means supported themselves against  
the rapidity of the torrent. In this man-  
ner they both safely arrived at the island,  
and having given each of the two poor  
Indians a pole, they all returned safely  
to the main.  
  
Since the above accident, the Indians  
often go to this island to kill deer, which,  
having endeavoured to cross the river  
above the fall, are driven on the island  
by the stream.  
  
REPRINTS  
  
Formerly a part of the rock at the  
fall, which is on the west side of the  
island, hung over in such a manner that  
the water which fell perpendicularly from  
it left a vacancy below, so that there  
was a passage at the bottom of the fall,  
between the rock and the water; but  
some years ago the prominent part broke  
off and fell down, so that now there is  
no possibility of going between the fall-  
ing water and the rock, the former  
touching the latter from the upper part  
to the bottom of the fall. The breadth  
of the fall, as it forms a semicircle, is  
reckoned to be about 360 yards. The  
island is in the middle of the fall, and  
about 40 yards broad at its lower end.  
  
Every day when the sun shines, from  
ten in the morning until two in the after-  
noon, below the fall and under you,  
when you stand at the side over the fall,  
you see a glorious rainbow, and some-  
times two, one within another. I was  
so fortunate as to be at the fall on a fine  
clear day, and contemplated with great  
delight this beautiful phenomenon, which  
was embellished with those brilliant col-  
ours conspicuous in a rainbow formed  
in the air. When the wind carries the  
vapours from place to place, the rainbow  
is often invisible, but becomes conspicu-  
ous as soon as new vapors are formed
