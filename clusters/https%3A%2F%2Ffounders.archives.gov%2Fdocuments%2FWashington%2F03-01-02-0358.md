The unnatural Contest between the English Colonies and Great-Britain, has now risen to such a Heighth, that Arms alone must decide it. The Colonies, confiding in the Justice of their Cause, and the Purity of their Intentions, have reluctantly appealed to that Being, in whose Hands are all human Events. He has hitherto smiled upon their virtuous Efforts—The Hand of Tyranny has been arrested in its Ravages, and the British Arms which have shone with so much Splendor in every Part of the Globe, are now tarnished with Disgrace and Disappointment.—Generals of approved Experience, who boasted of subduing this great Continent, find themselves circumscribed within the Limits of a single City and its Suburbs, suffering all the Shame and Distress of a Siege. While the trueborn Sons of America, animated by the genuine Principles of Liberty and Love of their Country, with increasing Union, Firmness and Discipline repel every Attack, and despise every Danger.  
Above all, we rejoice, that our Enemies have been deceived with Regard to you—They have perswaded themselves, they have even dared to say, that the Canadians were not capable of distinguishing between the Blessings of Liberty, and the Wretchedness of Slavery; that gratifying the Vanity of a little Circle of Nobility—would blind the Eyes of the People of Canada.—By such Artifices they hoped to bend you to their Views, but they have been deceived, instead of finding in you that Poverty of Soul, and Baseness of Spirit, they see with a Chagrin equal to our Joy, that you are enlightned, generous, and virtuous—that you will not renounce your own Rights, or serve as Instruments to deprive your Fellow Subjects of theirs.—Come then, my Brethren, unite with us in an indissoluble Union, let us run together to the same Goal.—We have taken up Arms in Defence of our Liberty, our Property, our Wives, and our Children, we are determined to preserve them, or die. We look forward with Pleasure to that Day not far remote (we hope) when  
  
the Inhabitants of America shall have one Sentiment, and the full Enjoyment of the Blessings of a free Government.  
Incited by these Motives, and encouraged by the Advice of many Friends of Liberty among you, the Grand American Congress have sent an Army into your Province, under the Command of General Schuyler; not to plunder, but to protect you; to animate, and bring forth into Action those Sentiments of Freedom you have disclosed, and which the Tools of Despotism would extinguish through the whole Creation.—To co-operate with this Design, and to frustrate those cruel and perfidious Schemes, which would deluge our Frontiers with the Blood of Women and Children; I have detached Colonel Arnold into your Country, with a Part of the Army under my Command—I have enjoined upon him, and I am certain that he will consider himself, and act as in the Country of his Patrons, and best Friends. Necessaries and Accommodations of every Kind which you may furnish, he will thankfully receive, and render the full Value.—I invite you therefore as Friends and Brethren, to porvide him with such Supplies as your Country affords; and I pledge myself not only for your Safety and Security, but for ample Compensation. Let no Man desert his Habitation—Let no one flee as before an Enemy. The Cause of America, and of Liberty, is the Cause of every virtuous American Citizen; whatever may be his Religion or his Descent, the United Colonies know no Distinction but such as Slavery, Corruption and arbitrary Domination may create. Come then, ye generous Citizens, range yourselves under the Standard of general Liberty—against which all the Force and Artifice of Tyranny will never be able to prevail.

T he unnatural contclt between the  
Engliib colonies and Great Britain,  
has now rifen to fuch a height, that  
Arms aloire muft decide it. The colo-  
  
^ And the purity of their intentions, have  
; rdudantly appealed to that being, in  
whofc hands are all human events. He  
&#x27; has hitherto fmiltd upon their virtuous  
ef^&#x27;»rtb—the hand of lyraiuiy has been  
arrefted in its ravages, and the Brililh  
arms, which have (hone with fo much  
fplendor in every part of the globe, are  
now tarnilhed with difgrace and difap*  
pointinent.—Generals of approved ex-  
. perience, who boafted of fubduiiig this  
great continent, find thcmfelvcs circum-  
. Icribed within the limits of a Tingle city  
and its fuburbs, fuflfcjing all the (hamc  
and diftrefs of a fiege: While the free-  
&#x27; born ions of America, animated by the  
T genuine principles of liberty and love of  
r ihcir country, with increating union,  
firmnefs, and difeipline, repel every at-  
; tack, and defpife every danger.  
  
Above all, we rejoice, that our cue-  
mies have been deceived with regard to  
vyou—They have perfuaded themfclves,  
they have even dared to fay, that the  
Canadians were not capable of diftin-  
guilhing between the bleffines of liberty,  
and the wretchednefs of ^avery; that  
gratifying the vanity of a little circle of  
nobility—&#x27;Would blind the eyes of the  
people of Canada.—By luch artifices  
• they hoped to btnJ you to their views,  
; but they have been deceived.; inftead of  
/ finding in you that poverty of foul, and  
^ balencfs of fpirit, they fee with a chagrin  
equal to our joy, that yoa: are enlighten¬  
ed, generous, and virtuous—that you  
will not renounce your own rights, or  
g ferve as infiruments to deprive your fcl-  
i low fubje^ts of theirs.—Come then, my  
Jtkrcthrcn, unite with us in an indiffolu-  
  
ble union ; let us run together to the  
fame goal.—We have taken up arms in  
defence of our liberty, our property, our  
Wives,and our children; we are deter¬  
mined to preferve them, or Trie. We  
look forward with pleaiure to that clay,  
not far remote, (we hope), when the in¬  
habitants of America iliall have one fen-  
timent, and ihe full enjoyment of the  
bleiTings of a free government.  
  
Incited by thefe motives, and encou*  
raged by the acivice of many friends of  
liberty among you, the grand American  
congrefs have lent an army into your  
province, under the command of gener.il  
Schuyler—not to plunder, biit to pro-  
teift youto animate, and bring forth  
into action Ihofc lentiments of freedom  
you havedifehjfed, and which the tools  
of dcfpotifm would extinguilh th rough  
the whole creation. To co-operate  
with this defign, and to fruftratc thofe  
cruel and perfidious fchemei, which  
would deluge our frontiers with the  
blood of v/omen and children, I have  
detached col. Arnold into your country,  
with a party of the army under my.com¬  
mand.—I have enjoined upon him, and  
1 am certain that he will conlider him-  
fclf, and ad as in the country &lt;&#x27;f his pa¬  
trons, and btfi fiicnda. Nccefiaries and  
accomodations of every kind w hich you  
may furnifli, he will thankfully receive,&#x27;  
and render the full value—1 invite you  
therefore as friends ami brethren, to  
provide him with fuch fupplies as your  
country affords; and I plc«!gc rnyfeli not  
only for your fafety and tccuiity, but lor  
ample compenfation. Tet no man de-  
fert his habitation—let no one Oce as be¬  
fore an enemy. The caule of America,  
and of liberty, is the cauic td&#x27; every vir¬  
tuous American citizen; whatever may  
be his religion or his defccut, the united  
colonies know no diftindion but fuch as  
fiavery, corruption, and arbitrary domi¬  
nation may create. Come then, ye ge¬  
nerous citizens I range youifelvea under  
the ftandard of general libeity—^gai^ift  
which all the force and artifice of tyranny  
will never be able to prevail.

height that arms alone must decide it. The Colonies,  
confiding in the justice of their cause and the  
purity of their intentions, have reluctantly ap­
