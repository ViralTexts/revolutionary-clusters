in the year 1764, Bermudians and other British subjects, who had, according to annual custom, taken possession of Turk’s Island, for the season of making salt, having been forcibly removed, with their vessels and effects, by a French

. The title to them had been a subject of controversy, among  
						several of the maritime nations of Europe. From the position of the islands, and other circumstances, the pretensions of Spain bore an advantageous comparison with those of her competitors. In the year 1770, the British took possesion of Port Egmont, in one of the islands,  
						the Spaniards being at that time in possession of another part, and protesting against a settlement by the British. The protest being without effect, ships and troops were sent from Buenos Ayres, by the governor of that place, which forcibly dispossessed and drove off the  
						British settlers. The British government, looking entirely to the dispossession by force, demanded, as a specific condition, of (for) preserving harmony between the two Courts, not only the disavowal of the Spanish proceedings, but that the affairs of that settlement should  
						be immediately restored to the precise state in which they were, previous to the act of dispossession. The Spanish government made some difficulties; requiring, particularly, a disavowal, on the part of Great Britain, of the conduct of her officer, at Falkland’s Islands,  
						which, it was alleged, gave occasion to the steps taken by the Spanish governor; and proposing an adjustment, by mutual stipulation, in the ordinary form.  
					“The reply was, that the moderation, of His Britannic Majesty, having limited his demand to the smallest reparation he could accept, for the injury done, nothing was left for discussion, but the mode of carrying the disavowal and restitution into execution;  
						reparation losing its value, if it be conditional, and to be obtained by any stipulation whatever, from the party injured.  
					“The Spanish government yielded. The violent proceedings of its officers were disavowed. The fort, the port, and every thing else, were agreed to be immediately restored to the precise situation which had been disturbed; and duplicates of orders, issued for  
						the purpose, to the Spanish officers, delivered into the hands of one of the British Principal Secretaries of State. Here, again, it is to be remarked, that satisfaction having been made, for the forcible dispossession, the islands lost their importance, in the eyes of the  
						British government, were in a short time evacuated, and Port Egmont remains, with every other part of them, in the hands o

laining party:  
					“Again: in the year 1789, certain English merchants having opened a trade at Nootka Sound, on the North West coast of America, and attempted a settlement at that place, the Spaniards, who had long claimed that part of the world as their exclusive property,  
						dispatched a frigate from Mexico, which captured the two English vessels (that were) engaged in the trade, and broke up the settlement on the coast. The Spanish government was the first to complain, in this case, of the intrusions committed by the British merchants. The  
						British government, however, demanded, that the vessels, taken by the Spanish frigate should be restored, and adequate satisfaction granted, previous to any other discussion. This demand prevailed; the Spanish government agreeing to make restoration of the captured vessels,  
						and to indemnify the parties interested in them, for the losses sustained. They restored also the buildings and tracts of land, of which the British subjects had been dispossessed. The British, however, soon gave a proof of the little value, they set on the possession, by a  
						voluntary dereliction, under which it has since remained.”

sion.” “THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT YIELDED.” Now, the analogy of the case consists in this, that to restore things to the precise state in which they were, previous to the act of dispossession, the  
							Proclamation, the interdict, the act of dispossession must be recalled. Great Britain, less strict than in the former case, does not demand a  
							disavowal of the proceeding.  
					Sir, if there be reason in what I have advanced, permit me to suggest to you, how little weight is due to the observations which follow, and which you will perceive to be cited from the recent publication of Mr. John Quincy Adams:  
					“The great obstacle, which has always interfered, in the adjustment of our differences with Britain, has been, that she would not acquiesce in the only principle, on which a negotiation, between independent nations, can be conducted, the principle of  
						reciprocity; that she refuses the application, to us, of a claim which she asserts for herself. The forcible taking of men, from an American vessel, was an essential part of the outrage upon the Chesapeake. It was the ostensible purpose, for which that act, of war  
						unproclaimed, was committed. The President’s Proclamation was a subsequent act, and was avowedly founded upon many similar aggressions, of which that was only the most aggravated.  
					“If then, Britain could, with any colour of reason, claim, that the general question of impressment should be laid out of the case altogether, she ought, upon the principle of reciprocity, to have laid equally out of the case, the Proclamation, a measure so easily separated from it, and, in its nature, merely defensive. When, therefore, she made the repeal of the Proclamation an indispensable preliminary, to all this discussion, upon the nature and extent of  
						that reparation, which she had offered, she refused to treat with us upon the footing of an independent power. She insisted upon an act of self-degradation, on our part, before she would even tell us, what redress she would condescend to grant, for a great and acknowledged  
						wrong. This was a condition which she could not but know would be inadmissible, and is of itself nearly conclusive, that her cabinet never intended to make, for that wrong, any reparation at all.”  
					You will pardon me, if I attempt to place, in the same point of view, the following extract, from your own letter:  
					“The President, having interposed this precautionary interdict, (the Proclamation) lost no time, in instructing the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States, to represent, to the British  
						government, the signal aggression, which had been committed on their sovereignty, and their flag, and to require the satisfaction due for it; indulging the expectation, that His Britannic Majesty would at once  
						perceive it to be the truest maganimity, as well as the strictest justice, to offer that prompt and full expiation, of an acknowledged wrong, which would re-establish, and improve, both in fact and in feeling, the state of things which it had  
						violated.

I he great obstaclcwhich has alwa\s inter­  
fered with the adjustment of our differences with  
Rritain, has been that she would not acquiesce  
I in the only principle upon which fair negotiation  
between independent nations can be cundumgd,  
the principle of reciprocity—that she refuse,  
the application to us of the claim which she as­  
serts for herself. The forcible taking of men  
from an American vessel, was an essential pan  
of the outrage upon the Chesapeake. It wa.»  
the ostensible purpose for which that act of war

was avowedly founded upou many similar ag­  
gressions, of which that was only&quot; the most a­  
giavated.  
  
II then Britain could, with any colour of rea­  
son, claim that the general question of impress­  
ment should be laid out of the case altogether,  
she ought upon the principle of reciprocity, to  
have laid equally out of the case, the proclairia­

its nature merely defensive. When therefore  
she made the repeal ot the proclamation an in­
