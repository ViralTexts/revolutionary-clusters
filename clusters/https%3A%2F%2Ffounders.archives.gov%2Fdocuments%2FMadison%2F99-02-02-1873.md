 and to the idea that it was a compact between the Govts. of the States, and the Govt. of the  
U. S; an idea promoted by the familiar one applied to Govts. independent of the people, particularly the British, of a  
compact between the monarch &amp; his subjects, pledging protection on one side &amp; allegiance on the other.  
The plain fact of the case, is that the Constitution of the U. S. was created by the people composing the  
respective States, who alone had the right; that they organized the Govt. into Legis. Ex. &amp; Judicy. departs.  
delegating thereto certain portions of power, to be exercised over the whole, and reserving the other portions to  
themselves, respectively. As these distinct portions of power were to be exercised by the General Govt. &amp; by the  
State Govts.; by each within limited spheres; and as of course controversies concerning the boundaries of their powers wd.  
happen, it was provided that these should be decided by ye supreme Court of the U. S. so constituted as to be as impartial  
as it could be made by the mode of appointment &amp; responsibility for the Judges.  
Is there then no remedy for usurpations in which the Supreme Ct of the U. S. concur? Yes: such Constitutional  
remedies as have been found effectual; particularly in case of Alien &amp; Sedition laws, and such as will in all  
cases be effectual, whilst the responsibility of the Genl. Govt. to its Constituents continues—Remonstrances &amp;  
instructions—now recurring Re-elections &amp; impeachments, Amendt of Const as provided by itself, &amp;  
exemplified in the 11th. art [of Const]. limiting the sensibility of the States. These are resources of the States agst. the Genl. Govt: resulting from the  
relations of the States to that Govt: whilst no corresponding controul exists in the relations of the Genl. to the  
individual Govts. all of whose functionaries are independent of the U. S in their appt &amp; responsibility.
