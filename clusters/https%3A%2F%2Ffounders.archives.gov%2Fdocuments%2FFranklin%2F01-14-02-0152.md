Paris, Sept. 14. 1767  
I am always pleas’d with a Letter from you, and I flatter myself you may be sometimes pleas’d in receiving one from me, tho’ it should be of little Importance, such as this, which is to consist of a few occasional Remarks made here and in my Journey hither.  
Soon after I left you in that agreable Society at Bromley, I took the Resolution of making a Trip with Sir John Pringle into France. We set out the 28th past. All the way to Dover we were furnished with Post Chaises hung so as to lean forward, the Top coming down over one’s Eyes, like a Hood, as if to prevent one’s seeing the Country, which being one of my great Pleasures, I was engag’d in perpetual Disputes with the Innkeepers, Hostlers and Postillions about getting the Straps taken up a Hole or two before, and let down as much behind, they insisting that the Chaise leaning forward was an Ease to the Horses, and that the contrary would kill them. I suppose the Chaise leaning forward looks to them like a Willingness to go forward; and that its hanging back shows a Reluctance. They added other Reasons that were no Reasons at all, and made me, as upon a 100 other Occasions, almost wish that Mankind had never been endow’d with a reasoning Faculty, since they know so little how to make use of it, and so often mislead  themselves by it; and that they had been furnish’d with a good sensible Instinct instead of it.  
At Dover the next Morning we embark’d for Calais with a Number of Passengers who had never been before at Sea. They would previously make a hearty Breakfast, because if the Wind should fail, we might not get over till Supper-time. Doubtless they thought that when they had paid for their Breakfast they had a Right to it, and that when they had swallowed it they were sure of it. But they had scarce been out half an Hour before the Sea laid Claim to it, and they were oblig’d to deliver it up. So it seems there are Uncertainties even beyond those between the Cup and the Lip. If ever you go to sea, take my Advice, and live sparingly a Day or two before hand. The Sickness, if any, will be the lighter and sooner over. We got to Calais that Evening.  
Various Impositions we suffer’d from Boat-men, Porters, &amp;c. on both Sides the Water. I know not which are most rapacious, the English or French; but the latter have, with their Knavery the most Politeness.  
The Roads we found equally good with ours in England, in some Places pav’d with smooth Stone like our new Streets for many Miles together, and Rows of Trees on each Side and yet there are no Turnpikes. But then the poor Peasants complain’d to us grievously, that they were oblig’d to work upon the Roads full two Months in the Year without being paid for their Labour: Whether this is Truth, or whether, like Englishmen, they grumble Cause or no Cause, I have not yet been able fully to inform myself.  
The Women we saw at Calais, on the Road, at Bouloigne and in the Inns and Villages, were generally of dark Complexions; but arriving at Abbeville we found a sudden Change, a Multitude both of Women and Men in that Place appearing remarkably fair. Whether this is owing to a small Colony of Spinners, Woolcombers and Weavers, &amp;c. brought hither from Holland with the Woollen Manufacture about 60 Years ago; or to their being less expos’d to the Sun than in other Places, their Business keeping them much within Doors, I know not. Perhaps as in some other Cases, different Causes may club in producing the Effect, but the Effect itself is certain. Never was I in a Place of greater Industry, Wheels and Looms going in every House. As soon as we left Abbeville the Swarthiness return’d. I speak generally, for here are some fair Women at Paris, who I think are not whiten’d by Art. As to Rouge, they don’t pretend to imitate Nature in laying it on. There is no gradual Diminution of the Colour from the full Bloom in the Middle of the Cheek to the faint Tint near the Sides, nor does it show itself differently in different Faces. I have not had the Honour of being at any Lady’s Toylette to see how it is laid on, but I fancy I can tell you how it is or may be done: Cut a Hole of 3 Inches Diameter in a Piece of Paper, place it on the Side of your Face in such a Manner as that the Top of the Hole may be just under your Eye; then with a Brush dipt in the Colour paint Face and Paper together; so when the Paper is taken off there will remain a round Patch of Red exactly the Form of the Hole. This is the Mode, from the Actresses on the Stage upwards thro’ all Ranks of Ladies to the Princesses of the Blood, but it stops there, the Queen not using it, having in the Serenity, Complacence and Benignity that shine so eminently in or rather through her Countenance, sufficient Beauty, tho’ now an old Woman, to do extreamly well without it.  
You see I speak of the Queen as if I had seen her, and so I have; for you must know I have been at Court. We went to Versailles last Sunday, and had the Honour of being presented to the King, he spoke to both of us very graciously and chearfully, is a handsome Man, has a very lively Look, and appears younger than he is. In the Evening we were at the Grand Couvert, where the Family sup in Publick. The Form of their sitting at the Table was this:   
  
The Table as you see was half a Hollow Square, the Service Gold. When either made a Sign for Drink, the Word was given by one of the Waiters, A boire pour le Roy, or A boire pour la Reine, &amp;c. then two Persons within the Square approach’d, one with Wine the other with Water in Caraffes, each drank a little Glass of what they brought, and then put both the Caraffes with a Glass on a Salver and presented it. Their Distance from each other was such as that other Chairs might have been plac’d between any two of them. An Officer of the Court brought us up thro’ the Croud of Spectators, and plac’d Sir John so as to stand between the King and Madame Adelaide, and me between the Queen and Madame Victoire. The King talk’d a good deal to Sir John, asking many Questions about our Royal Family; and did me too the Honour of taking some Notice of me; that’s saying enough, for I would not have you think me so much pleas’d with this King and Queen as to have a Whit less Regard than I us’d to have for ours. No Frenchman shall go beyond me in thinking my own King and Queen the very best in the World and the most amiable.  
  
Versailles has had infinite Sums laid out in Building it and Supplying it with Water: Some say the Expence exceeded 80 Millions Sterling. The Range of Building is immense, the Garden Front most magnificent all of hewn Stone, the Number of Statues, Figures, Urns, &amp;c in Marble and Bronze of exquisite Workmanship is beyond Conception. But the Waterworks are out of Repair, and so is great Part of the Front next the Town, looking with its shabby half Brick Walls and broken Windows not much better than the Houses in Durham Yard. There is, in short, both at Versailles and Paris, a prodigious Mixture of Magnificence and Negligence, with every kind of Elegance except that of Cleanliness, and what we call Tidyness. Tho’ I must do Paris the Justice to say, that in two Points of Cleanliness they exceed us. The Water they drink, tho’ from the River, they render as pure as that of the best Spring, by filtring it thro’ Cisterns fill’d with Sand; and the Streets by constant Sweeping are fit to walk in tho’ there is no pav’d foot Path. Accordingly many well dress’d People are constantly seen walking in them. The Crouds of Coaches and Chairs for that Reason is not so great; Men as well as Women carry Umbrellas in their Hands, which they extend in case of Rain or two much Sun; and a Man with an Umbrella not taking up more than 3 foot square or 9 square feet of the Street, when if in a Coach he would take up 240 square feet, you can easily conceive that tho’ the Streets here are narrower they may be much less encumber’d. They are extreamly well pav’d, and the Stones being generally Cubes, when worn on one Side may be turn’d and become new.  
The Civilities we every where receive give us the strongest Impressions of the French Politeness. It seems to be a Point settled here universally that Strangers are to be treated with Respect, and one has just the same Deference shewn one here by being a Stranger as in England by being a Lady. The Custom House Officers at Port St. Denis, as we enter’d Paris, were about to seize 2 Doz. of excellent Bourdeaux Wine given us at Boulogne, and which we brought with us; but as soon as they found we were Strangers, it was immediately remitted on that Account. At the Church of Notre Dame, when we went to see a magnificent Illumination with Figures &amp;c. for the deceas’d Dauphiness, we found an immense Croud who were kept out by Guards; but the Officer being told that we were Strangers from England, he immediately admitted us, accompanied and show’d us every thing. Why don’t we practise this Urbanity to Frenchmen? Why should they be allow’d to out-do us in any thing?  
Here is an Exhibition of Paintings, &amp;c. like ours in London, to which Multitudes flock daily. I am not Connoisseur enough to judge which has most Merit. Every Night, Sundays not excepted here are Plays or Operas; and tho’ the Weather has been hot, and the Houses full, one is not incommoded by the Heat so much as with us in Winter. They must have some Way of changing the Air that we are not acquainted with. I shall enquire into it.  
Travelling is one Way of lengthening Life, at least in Appearance. It is but a Fortnight since we left London; but the Variety of Scenes we have gone through makes it seem equal to Six Months living in one Place. Perhaps I have suffered a greater Change too in my own Person than I could have done in Six Years at home. I  had not been here Six Days before my Taylor and Peruquier had transform’d me into a Frenchman. Only think what a Figure I make in a little Bag Wig and naked Ears! They told me I was become 20 Years younger, and look’d very galante; so being in Paris where the Mode is to be sacredly follow’d, I was once very near making Love to my Friend’s Wife.  
This Letter shall cost you a Shilling, and you may think it cheap when you consider that it has cost me at least 50 Guineas to get into the Situation that enables me to write it. Besides, I might, if I had staid at home, have won perhaps two shillings of you at Cribbidge. By the Way, now I mention Cards, let me tell you that Quadrille is quite out of Fashion here, and English Whisk all the Mode, at Paris and the Court.  
And pray look upon it as no small Matter, that surrounded as I am by the Glories of this World and Amusements of all Sorts, I remember you and Dolly and all the dear good Folks at Bromley. ’Tis true I can’t help it, but must and ever shall remember you all with Pleasure. Need I add that I am particularly, my dear good Friend Yours most affectionately

Paris, Sept. 14, 1767,  
DEAR POLLY,  
  
I am always pleased  
with a letter from you; andI flatter  
myself, that you may be sometimes  
pleased with one from me, though it  
should be of little importance, such  
as this, which is to consist of a few  
occasional remarks made here, and  
on my journey hither.  
  
Soon after I left you in that agree-  
able society at Bromley, I took  
the resolution of making a trip, with  
sir John Pringle, into France. We  
set outenthe 28th past. All the  
way to Dover we were furnished  
with post-ehaises hung so as to lean  
forward, the top eoming down over  
one’s eves like a hood, as if to pre-  
vent onc’s seeing the country, which  
being one of my greatest pleasures,  
I was engaged in perpetaal disputes  
  
with the inn keepers and postilions  
about getting the straps taken up a  
hole or two before and Iet down as  
much behind, they sisting the chaise  
leaning forward was an ease to the  
horses, and that the contrary would  
hill them. 1 suppose the chaise  
Jeaning forward looks to them like a  
willingness te go forward, and that  
its hanging back shows a reluctance.  
They added their reasons _ that  
were ho reasons at all, and made me,  
as upon a handred other occasions,  
almost wish that mankind had never  
been endowed with a reasoning facul-  
ty, since they know so little how to  
make use of if, andso often mislead  
themselves by it; and that they had  
been furnished with a good sensible  
instinet instead of it. —  
  
At Dover the next morning we em-  
barked for Calais with a number of  
passengers who had not been before  
at sea. They would previously make  
a hearty breakfast because if the wind  
should fail, we might not get over

till supper time. Doubtless they  
thought that when they had paid for  
their breakfast they had a right to it,  
and that when they had swallowed it  
  
they were sure of it. But they had  
scarce been out half an hour before  
the sea laid elaim to it; and they  
were obliged to deliver it up.—  
So it seems there are uncertaintics  
even beyond those between the enp  
and the lip. lf ever you go to sea,  
take my advice, and live sparingly  
a day or two beforehand; the sick-  
ness, if any, will be lighter and soon-  
erover. Wegot to Calais that even-  
ing.  
  
Various impositions are suffered  
from boatmen, porters, &amp;e. on both  
sides the water. I know not which  
are most rapacious the English or the  
French; but the latter have with  
their knavery, the most polite-  
ness.  
  
The roads we found equally good  
with ours in England, in some places  
paved with smooth stones, like our  
new streets, for-many miles together  
with rows of trees on each side ; and  
yet there are no turnpikes. -But then  
the poor peasants complain to us  
grievously that they were obliged to  
work upon the reads full two months  
in the year, without berag paid for  
their labour; whether this is trath  
orno, or whether like Englishmen,  
they grumble, cause or no cause, [  
have not been able fully to inform  
myself. .  
  
The women we saw at Calais, on  
the road to Bologne, and in the inns  
and villages, were generally of dark  
complexions ; but arriving at Abbe-  
ville, we found a sudden change, a  
multitude both of women and men in  
that place appearing remarkably fair:  
whether this is owing to a small colony  
of spinners, wool combers and wea-  
vers, brought hither from Holland  
with the woollen manufactory about  
sixty years ago, or to their being  
less exposed than in other places,  
their business keepiag them much  
within doors, I know uot. Perhaps,  
  
as in some other cases, different eau-  
ses may club in producing the effect,  
out the effect itselfis certain. Never  
was I ina place of greater industry,  
wheels ul looms going in every  
house.  
  
As soon as we left Abbeville the  
swarthiness returned. I speak gene-  
rally; for here are some fair women  
at Paris, who I think are not whiten-  
ed by art. As to rouge, they don’t  
pretend to imitate nature in laying it  
on. ‘There is no gradual diminution  
of the colour from the full bloom on  
the middie of the cheek to the faint  
tint near the sides; nor does it show  
itself differently in different faces. I  
have not had the honor of being at a  
lady’s toilet, to see howit is laid on;  
bnt [ fancy I could tell you how it is,  
or may be done. Cut a hole of three  
inches diameter in a piece of paper;  
place it on the side of your face in  
such a manner as that the top of the  
hole may be just under your eye; then  
with a brush dipped in the eolour,  
paint face and paper together; so  
when the paperis taken off, there  
will remain a patch of red exactly the  
form of the hole. This is the mode  
fromthe actress on the stage upwards  
through all the ranks of ladies, to the  
princesses of the blood; but it stops  
there, the queen not using it, having  
in the serenity, complacence, and be-  
nignity that shine so emineutly in (oer  
rather through) her countenance, suf-  
ficient beauty though now an old wo-  
may, to do extremely well without  
it. :  
  
You see I speak of the queen, as if  
I had seen her, aud so I have; for you  
must know I have been at court.  
We went to Versailles last Sunday,  
and had the honor bf being presented  
tothe king. He spoke to both of us  
very graciously and cheerfully, isa  
handsome man, has a very lively  
look, and appears younger than he  
is.  
  
In the evening we were at the  
Grand Couvert where the family sup

The table, as you see, was halfa  
hollow square, the service gold.  
When either made a sign for drink,  
the word was given by one of the  
waiters a boire pour le Roi, or a boire  
pour la Keine, &amp;c. ‘Then two per-  
sons within the square approached,  
one with wine and the other with  
water, in the earasfes ; each drank  
a little glass of what they brought,  
and then put both the carasfes, with  
a little glass on a salver and present-  
edit. ,  
  
The distance from each other was  
such as that three other chairs might  
have been placed between any two of  
them. An officer of the court brought  
us up through the erowd of specta-  
tors, and placed sir John so as to  
stand between the king and madame  
Adelaide, and me between the queen  
and madame Victoire. The king  
talked a good deal to sir John, ask-  
ing many questions, about our royal  
family ; and did me too the honor of  
taking some notice of me. ‘That’s  
saying enough ; for I would not have  
you think me so much pleased with  
this king and queen, as to have a  
whit less regard than I used to have  
for ours. No Frenehman shall go  
beyond me in thinking my own king  
and queen the very best in the worid,  
and the most amiable.  
  
Versailles has had infinite sums  
Jaid out in building it, and supplying  
it with water. Some say the expen-  
  
The garden front most magnificent,  
all of hewn stone; the number of  
statues, figures, urns, &amp;c. in marble  
and bronze, of exquisite workman-  
ship, is beyond conception ; but the  
water-works are out of repair, and so  
is great part of the front next the  
town, looking with its shabby half  
brick walls, and broken windows,  
not much better~than the houses in  
Durham yard. ‘There is in short  
both at Versailles and Paris, a pro-  
digious mixture of magnificence and  
negligence with every kind of ele-  
gance except that of cleanliness, and  
what we eall tidiness ; though 1 must  
do Paris the justice to say, that in  
two kind of cleanliness they exceed  
us; the water they drink, though  
from the river, they render pure as  
that of the best spring, by filtering  
it through cisterns filled with sand ;  
and the streets by constant sweeping,  
are fit to walk in, though there is no  
paved foot-path. Accordingly many  
well-dressed people are constantly  
seen walking in them; the erowd of  
coaches and chairs is not so great ;  
men, as well as women, carry um-  
brellas in their hands, which they  
extend in case of rain, or two much  
sun; and a man with an umbrella  
not taking up more than three feet,  
cqguare, or nine square feet ofthe street  
when, if in a coach, he would take  
up two hundred and forty square feet,  
you ean easily conceive that though  
the streets here are narrower, they

may be much less ineumbered. They  
are extremely well appar and the  
stones, being generally eubes, when  
worn on ene side, may be turned and  
become new.  
  
The civilities we every where re-  
eeive give us the strongest impres-  
sions of Freneh spree It seems  
to be a point settled here universally,  
that strangers are to be treated with  
respect; and one has just the same  
deference shown one here, by seeing  
, stranger as in England, by being  
a lady—The eustom-house officers at  
Porte St. Dennis, as we entered  
Paris, were about to seize two dozen  
  
sofexcellent Bourdeaux wine, given  
us at Bologne, and which we brought  
with ws; but as soon as they found  
we were strangers, it was immediate-  
sly remitted to us on that account.  
  
At the church of Notre Dame,  
where we went to see a magnificent  
illumination, with figures &amp;c for the  
deceased dauphiness, we found an  
immense erowd, who were kept out  
by the guards ; but, the officer being  
told we were strangers from England,  
he immediately admitted us, accom-  
panied, and dened us every thing.  
Why don’t we practice this urbanity  
to Frenchmen? Why should they be  
allowed to outdo us in any thing P  
  
Here is an exhibition of painting,  
&amp;e. like ours in London, to which  
iaultitudes flock daily—I am not con-  
uoisgeur eneugh to judge which has  
most merit—every night, Sundays  
not excepted, here are plays, or  
operas : and though the weather has  
not been hot, and the houses full,  
one is not incommoded by the heat so  
much as with us in winter; they  
must have some way of changing the  
air, that we are not acquainted with;  
1 shall inquire into it.  
  
Travelling is one way of lengthen-  
ing lives, at least in appearance. It  
  
is but about-a fortnight sinee I left  
London ; but the variety of scenes  
we have gone through makes it seem  
equal to six months living in any one  
Place. . Perhaps I have suffered a  
greater change too, to my own person,  
than I could have done in six years

at home. I had not been here six  
days before my taylor and peruquier  
had transformed me intoa French-  
man. Only think what a figure I  
make in a little bag-wig, and naked  
ears! They told me, I had become  
twenty years younger, and looked  
very gallant; so being in Paris,  
where the mode is to be sacredly fol-  
lowed, I was once very near making  
love to.my friend’s wife.  
  
This letter will cost you a shilling;  
and you may think it cheap when you  
consider that it cost me at least fifty  
guineas to get into the situation that  
enables me to write it. Besides I  
might if [had staid at home, have  
wen, perhaps two shillings of you at  
cribbage. By the way, now | men-  
tions cards, let me tell you that  
quadrille is quite out of fashion here ;  
and English whist all the mode at  
Paris and the court.  
  
And pray look upon it as no small  
matter, that surrounded as I am by  
the glories of the world, and by  
amusements of all sorts, I remember  
you and Dolly, and all the dear  
folks at Bromley. It is true I ean-  
not help it, but must and ever shall  
remember all with pleasure. Need  
I add that I am particularly,  
  
My dear good friend,  
Yours most affectionately,

Paris, Sefitember 14, 1767.  
BEAR POLLY,  
  
Iam always pleased with a letter from you; and I flatter  
myself, that you may be sometimes pleased with one from me,  
though it should be of little importance, such as this, which  
is to consist of a few occasional remarks made here, and on my  
journey hither.  
  
Soon after I left you in that agreeable society at Bromley, I  
took the resolution of making a trip, with sir John Pringle, into  
France. We set out the 28th past. All the way to Dover we  
were furnished with post-chaises hung so as to lean forward,  
the top coming down over one’s eyes like a hood, as if to prevent  
one’s seeing the country, which being one of my greatest plea-  
sures, I was engaged in perpetual disputes with the inn keep-  
ers and postilions about getting the straps taken up a hole or two  
before and let down as much behind, they insisting the chaise  
leaning forward was an ease to the fhorses, and that the contrary  
would kill them. I suppose the chaise leaning forward looks to  
them like a willingness to go forward, and that its hanging back  
shows a reluctance. They added their reasons that were no  
reasons at all, and made me, as upon a hundred other occasions,  
almost wish that mankind had never been endowed with a. rea-  
soning faculty, since they know so litle how to make use of it,  
and so often mislead themselves by it; and that they had been  
furnished with a good sensible instinct instead of it.  
  
At Dover the next morning we embarked for Calais witha  
number of passengers who had not been before at sea. They:  
would previously make a hearty breakfast, because if the wind  
should fail, we might not get over till supper time. Doubtless  
they thought that when they had paid for their breakfast they  
had a right to it, and that when they had swallowed it they were

sure of it. Butthey had scarce been out half an hour before the  
sea laid claim to it; and they were obliged to deliver it up. So  
it seems there are uncertainties even beyond those between the  
cupand the lip. Ifever you go to sea, take my advice, and live  
sparingly a day or two beforehand; the sickness, if any, will be  
lighter and sooner over. We got to Calais that evening.  
  
Various impositions are suffered from: boatmen, porters, &amp;c.  
on both sides the water. I know not which are most rapacious,  
the English or the French; but the latter have with their kna-  
very, the most politeness.  
  
The roads we found equally good with ours in England, in  
some places paved with smooth stones, like our new streets, for  
many miles together, with rows of trees on each side; and yet  
there are no turnpikes. But then the poor peasants complained  
to us grievously that they were obliged to work upon the roads  
fulltwo months in the year, without being paid for their labour;  
whether this is truth or no, or whether like Englishmen, they  
grumble, cause or no cause, I have not been able fully to inform  
myself. :  
  
The women we saw at Calais, on the road to Bologne, and in  
  
  
  
the inns and villages, were generally of dark complexions; but  
arriving at Abbeville, we found a sudden change, a multitude  
both of women and men in that place appearing remarkably  
fair: whether this is owing tq a small colony of spinners, wool-  
combers and weavers, brought hither from Holland with the  
woollen manufactory about sixty years ago, or to their being less  
exposed than in other places, their business keeping them much  
within doors, I know not. Perhaps, as in some other cases, dif-  
ferent causes may Club in producing the effect, but the effect itself  
is certain. Never was I in a place of greater industry, wheels  
and looms going in every house.  
  
As soon as we left Abbeviile the swarthiness returned. I  
speak generally; for here are some fair women at Paris, who I  
think are not whitened by art. As to rouge, they don’t pretend to  
imitate nature in laying it on. There is no gradual diminution  
of the colour from the fuli bloom onthe middle of the cheek to  
the faint tint near the sides; nor does it show itself differently in  
different faces. I have not had the honour of being at a lady’s

toilet, to see how it is laid on; but I fancy I could tell you how  
it is, or may be done. Cut a hole of three inches diameter ina  
piece of paper; place it on the side of your face in such a manner  
as that the top of the hole may be just under your eye; then with  
a brush dipped in the colour, paint face and paper together; so  
when the paper is taken off, there will remain a patch of red ex-  
actly the form of the hole. This is the mode from the actress  
on the stage upwards, through all the ranks of ladies, to the prin-  
cesses of the blood; but it stops there, the queen not using it,  
having in the serenity, complacence, and benignity that shine so  
eminently in (or rather through) her countenance, sufficient beau-  
ty though now an old woman, to do extremely well without it.  
  
You see I speak of the queen, as if I had seen her, and so I  
have; for you must know I have been at court. We went to Ver-  
sailles last Sunday, and had the honor of being presented to the  
king. He spoke to both of us very graciously and cheerfully,  
is a handsome man, has a very lively look, and appears younger  
than he is.  
  
In the evening we were at the Grand Couvert where the fa-  
mily sup in public. The form of their sitting at table was this:  
  
  
  
  
  
Mad. Louise. | * Waiters. * | Mad. Sophia.  
  
SP SSE ee  
  
M. Victoire. | xX *% | M. Adelaide.  
* *  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Queen. King.  
  
The table, as you see, was half a hollow square, the service  
gold. When either made a sign for drink, the word was given by  
one of the waiters a boire pour le Roi, or a boire pour la Reine,  
&amp;c. Then two persons within the square approached, one with  
wine and the other with water, in the carasfes; each drank a lit-  
tle glass of what they brought, and then put boththe carasfes,  
with a little glass on a salver and presented it.

The distance from each other was such as that three other  
chairs might have been placed between any two of them. An  
officer of the court brought us up through the crowd of specta-  
tors, and placed sir John so as to stand between the king and  
madame Adelaide, and me between the queen and madame  
Victoire. The king talked a good deal to sir John, asking  
many questions about our royal family; and did me too the ho-  
nor of taking some notice ofme. That’s saying enough; for I  
would not have you think me so much pleased with this king  
and queen, as to have a whit less regard than I used to have for  
ours. No Frenchman shall go beyond me in thinking my  
own king and queen the very best in the world, and the most  
amiable.  
  
Versailles has had infinite sums laid outin building it, and  
supplying it with water. Some say the expenses exceed eighty  
millions sterling. The range of buildings isimmense. The gar-  
den front most magnificent, all of hewn stone; the number of  
statues, figures, urns, &amp;c. in marble and bronze, of exquisite  
workmanship, is beyond conception; but the water-works are  
out of repair, and so is great part of the front next the town,  
looking with its shabby half brick walls, and broken windows,  
not much better than the houses in Durham yard. There is in  
short both at Versailles and Paris, a prodigious mixture of magni-  
ficence and negligence with every kind of elegance except that  
of cleanliness, and what we call ¢idiness; though I must do Paris  
the justice to say, that in two kinds of cleanliness they exceed  
FEE: us: the water they drink, though from the river, they render as  
pure asthatof the best spring, by filtering it through cisterns  
filled with sand; and the streets by constant sweeping, are fit to  
nat walk in, though there is no paved foot-path. Accordingly many  
k well-dressed people are constantly seen walking in them; the ©  
r: crowd of coaches and chairs is not so great; men, as well as wo-  
y men, carry umbrellas in their hands, which they extend in case  
of rain, or too much sun; and a man with an umbrella not taking  
up more than three feet square, or nine square feet, of the street,  
when, if in a coach, he would take up two hundred and forty  
square feet, you can easily conceive that though the streets here  
  
are narrower, they may be much less incumbered. They are

extremely well paved; and the stones, being generally cubes,  
when worn on one side, may be turned and become new.  
  
The civilities we every where receive give us the strongest  
impressions of French politeness. It seems to be a _ point  
settled here universally, that strangers are to be treated with re-  
spect; and one has just the same deference shown one here, by  
seeing a stranger as in England, by being a lady—The custom-  
house officers at Porte St. Dennis, as we entered Paris, were  
about to seize two dozen of excellent Bourdeaux wine, given us  
at Bologne, and which we brought with us; but as soon as they  
found we were strangers, it was immediately remitted to us on  
that account.  
  
  
  
  
  
At the church of Notre Dame, where we went to see a mag-  
nificent illumination, with figures, &amp;c. for the deceased dau-  
phiness, we found an immense crowd, who were kept out by the  
guards; but, the officer being told we were strangers from Eng-  
land, he immediately admitted us, accompanied, and showed us  
every thing. Why don’t we practice this urbanity to Frenchmen?  
Why should they be allowed to outdo us in any thing?  
  
Here is an exhibition of painting, &amp;c. like ours in London, to  
which multitudes flock daily—I am not connoisseur enough to  
judge which has most merit—every night, Sundays rot excepted,  
here are plays, or operas; and though the weather has not been  
hot, and the houses full, one is not incommoded by the heat so  
much as with us in winter; they must have some way of chang-  
ing the air, that we are not acquainted with—I shall inquire in-  
to it.  
  
Travelling is one way of lengthening lives, at 1: . st in appear-  
ance. It is but about a fortnight since I left London; but the  
variety of scenes we have gone through makes it seem equal to  
six menths living in any one place. Perhaps I have suffered a  
greater change too, in my own person, than I could have done in  
six years athome. I had not been here six days before my tay-  
lor and peruquier had transformed me into a Frenchman. Only  
think what a figure I make ina little bag-wig, and naked ears!  
They told me, I had become twenty years younger, and looked  
very gallant; so being in Paris, where the mode is to be sacred-  
ly followed, I was once very near making love to my friend’s wife.

Paris, 1-lth September, 1767.  
Df.ar Poi.ly :—I am always pleased with a loiter Irom  
you, and l Hatter myself you may be sometimes pleased  
m receiving tne from me, though it should be ol little im­  
portance, such as this, which is to consist of a lew occa­  
sional remarks made here, and in my journey hither.  
Soon after 1 lift yoN in that agreeable society at Brom­  
ley, I took the resolution of making a trip with Sir John  
Pringle into France. We set out on the 28th past. All  
the way to Dover wo were lurnished with post-chaises,  
hung so as to lean forward, the top coining down over one’s  
eyes, like a hood, as if to prevent one’s seeing the country; 1  
which being one ol my great pleasures, I was engaged in I  
perpetual dispute with the innkeepers, ostlers, and postil­  
ions, about gelling the straps taken up a hole or two be- 1  
lore, and letdown as much behind, they insisting that the !  
chaise leaning forward was an case to the horses, and that 1  
the contrary would kill them. I suppose the chaise lean- !  
ing forward looks to them like a willingness to go forward, :  
and that its hanging hack shows reluctance. They added I  
other reasons, that were no reasons at all, and made me,  
as upon a hundred other occasions, almost wish that man­  
kind had nover been endowed with a reasoning faculty,  
since they know so little how to make use of it, and so of­  
ten mislead themselves by it, and that thty had been (ur­  
nished with a good sensible instinct instead of it.  
At Dover, the nest morning, we embarked for Calais  
with a number of passengers, who had never before be&#x27;.n  
at sea. They would previously make a hearty breakfast,  
because, if the wind should fail, we mio|,t not get over  
till supper time. Doubtlsss JJiev-tKhupl.i. that when  
they had paid lor their lujJpffiat they had a right to it,  
and ll)at when HlftjMlktW wallowed it they were sure of j  
It. Buttj^y had scarce been out half an hour, before the  
to it, nnd they weie nhllg*J to deliver it up.  
MRS *&lt;•*■■■&gt;” are uncertainties, even beyond J  
^^^^cTwceii the cup and tho lip. If ever you go to sea, 1  
take my advice and live sparingly a day or two before j  
hand. The sickness, if any, will be lighter and sooner &#x27;&lt;  
over. We got lo Calais that evening.  
Various impositions we suffered from bontmen, porters I  
ami Ihe like, on both sides Ihe water. I know not which j  
are most rapacious, the English or French, but the latter !  
have, with their knavery, most politeness.  
The roads w e found equally good with ours in England,  
in some places paved with smooth stones, like our new  
streets, for many miles together, nnd rows of trees on each  
side, and yet there nre no turnpikes. But then Ihe poor  
peasants complained to us grievously, that they were  
obliged to work upon the roads full two months in Ihe  
year, without being paid for tbeir labor. Whether this is  
truth, or whether, like Englishmen, they grumble, cause  
or no cause, I have not yet been able fully to inform iny- !  
self.  
The women we saw af Calais, on the road, at Boulogne, !  
and in the inns and villages, were generally of dark com- 1  
plexiooa; but arriving at Abbeville we found a sudden  
change, a multitude of both women and men in that place 1  
appealing remarkably lair. Whether this is owing to a  
small colony of spinners, wool-roinbers, and weavers, !  
bioughl hither from Holland with the wooden manufacto­  
ry shout sixty yesis ago, or to their being less exposed lo  
the sun, than in other places, their business keeping them !  
much within doors, I know not. Perhaps, as in some 1  
other cases, different causes may club in producing the ef- &#x27;  
feci, but the effort itself is certain. Never was I in a  
place ol gieater industry, wheels and looms going in every &#x27;  
hou«e. I  
As soon as we left Abbeville ihe swarthiness returned. I  
I speak generally; for here are some fair women at Paris, j  
who, I ildnk are not whitened by art. Ait to rouge, they  
don I pretend to imitate nature in laying it oil. There is no  
gradual diminution of (he color, fiom Ihe full bloom in Ihe  
middle of Ihe check to the faint tint near Ihe sides, nor does ^  
it show itself differently In different (aces. I have not  
had the honor ol being at »ny lady’s toilette to see how it  
IS laid on, but I lanry I can tell yon bow it is or may be i  
done. Cut a hole ot three incites in diameter In a piece &#x27;  
of paper; place it on the side ol your face in snob a man- !  
tier, as that Ihe top ol the hole may be just under the eye’  
then, with a brush dipped in tho color, paint lace and pa­  
per together; so when the paper t« laktn off, them will {  
remain a round patch of red exactly the form of the hide

beauty, though now au old waiuan, extremely well with­  
out it.  
You see I apeak of the Queen as if 1 had seen her; and  
»o 1 have, for &gt;ou must know 1 have been at court. We  
went to Versailles last Sunday, and bad the honor of be­  
ing presented to the King; he spoko to both ol ua very  
graciously and very cheertully, is a handsome man, has a  
very lively look, and appeal* younger than he i* In the  
evening we were at the Grand Concert, where the fa­  
mily sup in public. The table was halt a hollow square,  
the service gold. When either made a sign for drink, the  
woul was given by one ol (lie waiters. A boire pour le  
Roi, or, .&#x27;I bob c pour le Reinc. Then two persona came  
from within, the one with wine and the other with water  
In carafes; each diank a little glass of what he brought,  
and then put both tint carafes with a glass on a salver,  
and then presented i(. Their distanco fioni eacli oilier  
was such, as that other chairs might have been placed be­  
tween any twool them. Au officer ol the court brought  
us up through the crowd of spectators, and placed &#x27;sir  
John so as (o stand between the Queen and Madamo  
\ ictoirc. &#x27;I lie King talked a good deal with Sir John,  
asking many questions about our royal family; and did me  
loo llie honor of taking some notice of me; that is saying  
enough; lor I would not have you iliiuk me so much pleas­  
ed with this king and queen, as (o have a whit less re­  
gard than 1 used to have lor ours. No Frenchman shall  
go beyond me iu thinking my own king and queen the  
verjr best in the woild, and the most amiable.  
Versailles has had infinite sums laid out iu building it  
and supplying it with water. Sum* say the expenses ex­  
ceeded eighty millions sterling. The rouge ol buildings  
is immense ; the garden-front most magnificent, all ol  
licwn alone ; the number ol statues, figures, urns, &amp;c. iu  
marble and bronze, of exquisite workmanship, is beyond  
conception. Hut the wsler works are out ol repair, and  
so is great part of (he Iron! next (lie town, looking with its  
shabby, hall-brick walls, and broken windows, not much  
bettor than the bouses in Durham Yard. There is, in  
?hoit, both at Versailles and Paris, a prodigious mixture  
ol magnificence and negligence, with every kind of cle­  
gance except (hat of cleanliness, and what we call tidi­  
ness. Though I must do Paris the justice to ssy, that in  
two points o. cleanliness Ihvy exceed us. The water they  
drink, though from the river, they render as pure as that  
of the best spring, by filtering it through cisterns filled  
with sand ; and the streets with constant sweeping are fit  
to walk in, though there is no paved foothpath. Accord­  
ingly, many well-dressed people are constantly seen walk­  
ing in them. I ho crowds ol coaches and chairs for this  
reason is not so great. Men, as well as women, carry um­  
brella* in their hand*, which they extend in case of rain  
or too much sun ; and, a man with an umbrella not taking  
up more than Ihreo loot square, or nine square feet ol the  
street, when, if in a coach, lie would lake up two hundred  
and forty snuaro leel, you can easily conceive that though  
Ihe streets here are narrow, they may bo much lose en­  
cumbered. They are extremely well paved, and the  
stones, being generally cubos, when worn oil one side,  
may be turned and become new  
  
I he civilities we everywhere receive give us the  
strongest impressions of the French politeness. It seems  
to be a point settled here universally, that strangers are to  
be treated with respect; and one has just the same de­  
ference shown one hero by being a stranger, as in Emr­  
lamlI by being a lady. The custom-house officers at Port  
St. Denis, at wo entered Paris, were about to seize two  
dozen ot excellent Bordeaux wine, given us at Boulogne  
.uid which we brought with us; hut as soon as they found  
we were strangers, it was immediately remitted on that ac­  
count. At tlie Church of Noire Dame, when we went to  
seo a magnificent illumination, with figures, &amp;c. for the  
deceased Dauphiness, wo found an immense erowd, who  
were kept out by guards; but the officer being told, that  
wo were strangers Iron. England, he immediately ad­  
milted us, accompanied and showed as every thing. Why  
don’t wo practise (his urbanity to Frenchmen/ Why  
should they be allowed to outdo us in any thing ?  
Here is an exhibition of painting, like ours in London,  
to which multitudes Hock daily. I am not connoisseur  
enough toju.lge which has most merit. Every night, Sun­  
days not excepted, here are plays or operas; and though  
lie weather has been hot, and the houses full, ono is not  
incommoded by the heat so much as with us in winter  
They must have some way of changing the air, that we  
are not acquainted with. I shall inquiro into it.  
Travelling is one way of lengthening life, at least in ap­  
pearance. It is but about a foitnight since wo left Lon­  
don, but the variety of scenes we have gone through  
makes it seem equal to six months living in one place,  
f erhaps I have suffered a greater change, too, in my own  
person, than I could have done in six years at home. I  
had not been here six days, before my tailor and perruniiier i  
had transformed mo into a Frenchman. Only think what  
a figure I make iu a little bag-wig and with naked ears !  
I hey told me I was become twenty years younger, and  
looked very gallant. 6 ’  
This letter shall cost you a shilling, snd you may consi­  
der it cheap, when you reflect, that it has cost me at least  
lilty guineas to get into the situation, that enables me to  
wnte it. Besides, I might, if I had stayed at home, have  
won perhaps two shillings of you at cribbage. By the  
way, now l mention cards, let me tell you that quadrille  
is now out of fashion here, and English whist all (lie mode  
at Parts and the court.  
And pray look upon it as no small matter, that, surround­  
ed as l am by the glories of the wot Id, and amusements ol  
al sorts, ! remember you and Dolly, and all (he dear good  
folks at Bromley. ’Tis true, I can’t help if, but must and  
ever shall remember you all with pleasure.  
Need I add, (hat I am particularly, my dear good friend  
Yours most affectionately, B. FRANKLIN

‘ Paris, 14 September, 1767.  
  
‘I am always pleased with a letter from you, and I flatter my-  
self you may be sometimes pleased in receiving one from me,  
though it should be of little importance, such as this, which is to  
consist of a few occasional remarks made here, and in my jour-  
ney hither.  
  
‘ Soon after I left you in that agreeable society at Bromley, 1  
took the resolution of making a trip with Sir John Pringle into  
France. We set out on the 28th past. All the way to Dover  
we were furnished with post-chaises, hung so as to Jean forward,  
the top coming down over one’s eyes, like a hood, as if to prevent  
one’s seeing the country ; which being one of my great pleasures,  
I was engaged in perpetual disputes with the innkeepers, ostlers,  
and postilions, about getting the straps taken up a hole or two  
before, and Jet down as much behind, they insisting that the  
chaise leaning forward was an ease to the horses, and that the  
contrary would kill them. | suppose the chaise leaning forward  
looks to them like a willingness to go forward, and that its hang-  
ing back shows reluctance. ‘They added other reasons, that were  
no reasons at all, and made me, as upon a hundred other occasions,  
almost wish that mankind had never been endowed with a rea-  
soning faculty, since they know so little how to make use of it,  
and so often mislead themselves by it, and that they had been  
furnished with a good sensible instinct instead of it.  
  
‘ At Dover, the next morning, we embarked for Calais with a  
number of passengers, who had never before been atsea. They  
would previously make a hearty breakfast, because, if tie wind  
should fail, we might not get over till supper time. Doubtless  
they thought, that when they had paid for their breakfast they

had a right to it, and that when they had swallowed it they were  
sure of it. But they had scarce been out half an hour, before  
the sea laid claim to it, and they were obliged to deliver it up.  
So that it seems there are uncertainties, even beyond those be-  
tween the cup and the lip. If ever you go to sea, take my ad-  
vice, and live sparingly a day or two beforehand. The sickness,  
if any, will be lighter and sooner over. We got to Calais that  
evening.  
  
‘Various impositions we suffered from boatmen, porters, and  
the like, on both sides the water. I know not which are most  
rapacious, the English or French, but the latter have, with their  
knavery, most politeness.  
  
‘The roads we found equally good with ours in England, in  
some places paved with smooth stones, like our new streets, for  
many miles together, and rows of trees on each side, and yet  
there are no turnpikes. But then the poor peasants complained  
to us grievously, that they were obliged to work upon the roads  
full two months in the year, without being paid for their labor.  
Whether this is truth, or whether, like Englishmen, they grum-  
ble, cause or no cause, I have not yet been able fully to inform  
myself.  
  
‘ The women we saw at Calais, on the road, at Boulogne, and  
in the inns and villages, were generally of dark complexions ;  
but arriving at Abbeville we found a sudden change, a multitude  
of both women and men in that place appearing remarkably fair.  
Whether this is owing toa small colony of spinners, wool-combers,  
and weavers, brought hither from Holland with the woollen man-  
ufactory about sixty years ago, or to their being less exposed to  
the sun, than in other places, their business keeping them much  
within doors, I know not. Perhaps, as in some other cases, dif-  
ferent causes may club in producing the effect, but the effect it-  
self is certain. Never was I in a place of greater industry,  
wheels and looms going in every house.  
  
‘As soon as we left Abbeville, the swarthiness returned. I  
speak generally ; for here are some fair women at Paris, who, I

then, with a brush dipped in the color, paint face and paper to-  
  
ether ; so when the paper is taken off, there will remain a round  
patch of red exactly the form of the hole. This is the mode,  
from the actresses on the stage upwards through all ranks of la-  
dies to the princesses of the blood ; but it stops there, the Queen  
not using it, having in the serenity, complacence, and benignity,  
that shine so eminently in, or rather through her countenance,  
sufficient beauty, though now an old woman, to do extremely  
well without it.  
  
‘You see I speak of the Queen as if I had seen her ; and so I  
have, for you must know I have been at court. We went to  
Versailles last Sunday, and had the honor of being presented to  
the King ; he spoke to both of us very graciously and very cheer-  
fully, is a handsome man, has a very lively look, and appears  
younger than he is. In the evening we were at the Grand Con-

distance from each other was such as that other chairs might  
have been placed between any two of them. An officer of the  
court brought us up through the crowd of spectators, and placed  
Sir John so as to stand between the Queen and Madame Vic-  
toire. ‘The king talked a good deal to Sir John, asking many  
questions about our royal family ; and did me too the honor of

Paris in 1767— Umbrellas. —“ T must do Paris  
the justice to say, that in two points of cleanli-  
ness they exceed us. The water they drink,  
though from the river, they render as pure as  
that of the best spring, by filtering it through  
cisterns filled with sand; and the streets with  
constant sweeping are fit to walk in, though  
there is no paved footpath. Accordingly, many  
well-dressed people are constantly seen walking  
in them. The crowds of coaches and chairs for  
this reason is not so great. Men, as well as  
women, carry umbrellas in their hands, which  
they extend in case of rain or too much sun.”

‘Paris, 14 Sepremper, 1767.  
  
‘TI am always pleased with a letter from you, and  
flatter myself you may be sometimes pleased in re-  
ceiving one from me, though it should be of little im.  
portance, such as this, which is to consist of a few  
occasional remarks made here, and in ‘my journey  
hither.  
  
‘Soon after I left you in that agreeable soviety at  
Bromley, I took the resolution of making a trip  
with Sir John Pringle into France. We went out  
on the 28th past. All the way to Dover we were  
furnished with post-chaises, hung so as to lean for-  
ward, the top coming down over one’s eyes, like a  
hood, as if to prevent one’s seeing the country;  
which being one of my great pleasures, I was en-  
gaged in perpetual disputes with the innkeepers, ost-  
lers, and postillions, about getting the straps taken  
up a hole or two before, and let down as much be-  
hind, they insisting that the chaise leaning forward  
was an ease to the horses, and that the ‘contrary  
would kill them. I suppose the chaise leaning for-  
ward looks to them like a willingness to go forward,  
and that its hanging back shows reluctance. They  
added other reasons, that were no reasons at all, and  
made me, upon a hundred occasions, almost wish  
that mankind had never been endowed with a rea-  
soning faculty, since they know so little how|to make  
use of it, and so often mislead themselves by it, and  
that they had been furnished with a good sensible  
instinct instead of it.  
  
* At Dover, the next morning, we embarked for  
  
Calais with a number of passengers, who had never  
  
been at seq. . would previously make a  
learty peo ag libs. orcas Dery

had swallowed it they were sure ofit. But they had  
scarce been out half an hour, before the sea laid  
claim to it, and they were obliged to deliver it up.  
So it seems there are uncertainties, even beyond  
those between the cup and the lip. It ever you go  
to sea, take my advice and live sparingly a day or  
two before hand. The sickness, if any, will be light-  
er and sooner over, We got to Calais that evening.  
  
‘ Various impositions we suffered from boatmen,  
porters and the like, on both sides the water. I know  
not which are most rapacious, the English or French  
but the latter have, with their knavery, most polite.  
ness.  
  
The roads we found equally good with those in  
England, in some places paved with smooth stones,  
like our new streets, for many miles together, and  
rows of trees on each side, and yet there are no turn-  
pikes. But then the poor peasants complained to us  
grievously, that they were obliged to work upon  
the roads full two months in the’ year, without be-  
ing paid for their labor. Whether this is the truth,  
or whether, like Englishmen, they grumble, cause  
or no cause, I have not yet been able fully to inform  
myself.  
  
‘The women we saw at Calais, on the road, at  
Boulogne, and in the inns and villages, were gene-  
rally of dark complexions ; but arriving at Abbevile  
we found a sudden chauge, a multitude of both wo-  
men and men in that place appearing remarkably  
fair. Whether this is owing to a small colony of  
spinners, wool-combers and weavers brought hither  
from Holland with the woollen manufactory about  
sixty years ago, or their being less exposed to the  
sun, than in other places, their business keeping  
them much within doors, I know not. Perhaps, as  
in some other cases, different causes may club. in  
producing the effect, but the effect itself is certain.  
Never was it in a place of greater industry, wheels  
and looms going in every house.  
  
*As soon as we left Abbeville, the swarthiness  
returned. I speak generally; for here are some fair  
women at Paris, who, I think, are not whitened by  
art. As to rouge, they don’t pretend to imitate na-  
ture in laying it on. There is no gradual diminu-  
tion of the color, from the full bloom in the middle of  
the cheek to the faint tint near the sides, nor does  
it show itself differently in different faces. I have  
not had the honor of being at any lady’s toilette to  
see how it is laid on, but I fancy I can tell you how  
  
ameter in a piece of paper; place it on the side of  
your face in such a manner, as that the top of the  
hole may be just under the eye; then, with a brush  
dipped in the color, paint the face and paper toge-  
ther: so when the paper is taken off, there will re-  
main a round patch of red exactly the form of the  
hole. This isthe mode, from the actresses on the  
stage upwards, through all ranks of ladies, to the  
princesses of the blood; but it stops there, the  
Queen not using it, having in the serenity, compla-  
cence, and benignity, that shine so eminently in, or  
rather through her countenance, sufficient beauty,  
though now an old woman, to do extremely well  
withuut it.  
“You see I speak of the Queen as if I had seen  
her ; and se I have, for you must know I have been  
at court. We went to Versailles last.Sunday, and  
had the honor of being presented to the King; he  
spoke to both of us very graciously and very cheer-  
fully, is a handsome man, has a very lively look, and  
appears younger than he is. In the evening we were  
at the Grand Concert, where the family sup in pub.  
lic. The table was half a hollow square, the ser-  
vice gold. When either made a sign for drink, the  
word was given by one of the waiters, a boire pour  
le Roi, or, a boire pour la Reine. Then two persons  
came from within, the one with wine and the other  
with water in carafes; each drank a little glass of  
what he brought, and then put both the carafes with  
a glass on a salver, and then presented it. Their  
distance from each other was such as that other  
chairs might have been placed between any two of  
them. An officer of the court brought us up through  
the crowd of spectators, and placed Sir John so as  
to stand between the Queen and Madam Victoire.—  
The King talked a good deal to Sir John, asking  
many questions about our royal family ; and did me  
too the honor of taking some notice of me; that is  
saying enough; for I would not have you think me  
80 much pleased with this king and queen, as to have  
a whit less eget than I barge to have for ours. No  
‘rench: go beyond me in thinking my own

England, he immediately admitted us, accomp

tise this urbanity to Frenchmen ? Why should they  
be allowed to outdo us inany thing?  
‘Travelling.is one way of lengthening life, at least  
in appearance. It is but a fortnight since we left  
London, but the variety of scenes we have gone  
through makes it seem equal to six months living in  
one place. Perhaps I have suffered a greater change,  
too, in my own person, than I could have done in  
six years at home. I had not been here six days,  
before my tailor and perruquier had transformed me  
into a Frenchman. Only think what a figure I make  
ina little bag-wig, and with naked ears! They told  
me I was become twenty years younger, and looked

make a hearty breakfast, because, if the wind should fail, we might not  
get over till supper time. Doubtless they thought, that when they had  
paid for their breakfast they had a right to it, and that when they had  
swallowed it they were sure of it. But they had scarce been out half an  
hour, before the sea laid claim to it, and they were obliged to deliver it  
up. So that it seems there are uncertainties, even beyond those between  
thecup and the lip. If ever you go to sea, take my advice, and live spar-  
ingly a day or two beforehand. The sickness, if any, will be lighter and  
sooner over. We got to Calais that evening.  
  
‘ Various impositions we suffered from boatmen, porters, and the like, on  
both sides the water. I know not which are most rapacious, the English  
or French, but the latter have, with their knavery, most politeness.  
  
‘The women we saw at Calais, on the road, at Boulogne, and in the  
inns and villages, were generally of dark complexions; but arriving at  
Abbeville, we found a sudden change, a multitude of both women and  
men in that place appearing remarkably fair. Whether this is owing toa  
small colony of spinners, wool-combers, and weavers, brought hither from  
Holland with the woollen manufactory about sixty years ago, or to their  
being less exposed to the sun than in other places, their business keeping  
them much within doors, I know not. Perhaps, as in some other cases,  
different causes may club in producing the effect, but the effect itself is  
certain. Never was I in a place of greater industry, wheels and looms  
going in every house,  
  
‘As soon as we left Abbeville, the swarthiness returned. I speak ge-  
nerally; for here are some fair women at Paris, who, f{ think, are not whi-  
tened by art. As to rouge, they don’t pretend to imitate nature in laying  
iton. There is no gradual diminution of the color, from the full bloom in  
the middle of the cheek to the faint tint near the sides, nor does it shew it-  
self differently in different faces. I have not had the honor of being at  
any lady’s toilette to see how it is laid on, but I fancy I can tell you how  
it is or may be done. Cut a hole of three inches diameter inj a piece of  
paper; place it on the side of your face in such a manner, as that the top  
of the hole may be just under the eye; then, with a brush dipped in the  
color, paint face and paper together; so when the paper is taken off, there  
will remain a round patch of red exactly the form of the hole. This is  
the mode, from the actresses on the stage upwards through all ranks of  
ladies to the princesses of the blood; but it stops there, the Queen not  
using it, having in the serenity, complacence, and benignity that shine so  
eminently in, or rather, through her countenance, sufficient beauty, though  
now an old woman, to do extremely well without it.  
  
‘ We went to Versailles last Sunday, and had the honor of being pre-  
sented to the King; he spoke to both of us very graciously and very  
cheerfully, is a handsome man, has a very lively look, and appears young-  
er than he is. In the evening we were at the Grand Concert, where the  
family sup in public. The table was half a hollow square, the service  
gold. When either made a sign for drink, the word was given by one of  
the waiters. 4 boire pour le Roi, or A boire pour la Reine. Then two  
Persons came from within, the one with wine and the other with water in

from each other was such as that other chairs might have been placed be-  
tween any two of them.  
  
‘The civilities we every where receive give us the strongest impressions  
of the French politeness. It seems to be a point settled here universally,  
that strangers are to be treated with respect; and one has just the same  
  
deference shewn one here by being a stranger, as in England by being a  
lady.’—pp. 253—255.

ing forward was an ease to the horses, and that  
the contrary would kill them. I suppose the}  
chaise leaning forward looks to the m like a  
willingness to go forward, and that its hanging  
back shows reluctance. They added other  
reasons, that were no reasons at all, and made  
me, as upon a hundred other occasions, almost  
wish that mankind had never been endowed  
with a reasoning faculty, since they know  
little how to make use of it, and so often mis-

Paris in 1767— Umbrellas —“I must do Paris  
the justice to say, that in two points of cleanli-  
ness they exceed us. The water they drink,  
though from the river, they render as pure as  
that of the best spring, by filtering it through  
cisterns filled with sand; and the streets with  
constant sweeping are fit to walk in, though  
there is no paved footpath. Accordingly, many  
well-dressed people are constantly seen walking  
in them. The crowds of coaches and chairs for  
this reason is not so great. Men, as well as  
women, carry umbrellas in their hands, which  
they extend in case of rain or too much sun.”

&#x27;•7 with Sir John Pringle into Fromm, ITo sot out on   
-the 28th past. All the way to Dover Iva were   
• furnished with pOst.ohaises hung so as to leanafor­

- of it, and so often mislead themselves by it; and   
that they:had been furnialted with a good sensible   
instinct instead of-it.   
  
- At Dover,lhe next morning, we embarked for   
&#x27; Galata &#x27;with a number of passengers wild bad not   
been before at sea. They, would. preview:ly make   
a hearty breakfast; booms° If the wind should

• Mee, and Ave sparingly a day or two beforehand;   
the eickness; if any, will be lighter, and sooner   
over: Got to&#x27; Bales that day.   
Perfeut impositions are euffered from boatmen,   
porters, do., on both sides of the water. I know   
Lot which are most rapaotoue, the English or the&#x27;   
Numb ; but the latter have, with their knavery,   
the Most politeness. .-   
The roads we found equally good with (Mrs in Eng­  
-Bat then the poor peasants complained to ue   
- sully that they were obliged to work upon the road&amp;   
ttre months in the year, without being paid for   
their labor; whether this is true or no, or whether,   
-like Englishmen, they grumble, cause or no °sum,   
I have not been able fully to inform myself. The   
women we atm on the road to Boulogne, and in the   
inns mid villages, were generally of dark complex­  
ions ; but arrifing at Abbeville, we found a sudden   
-change, a multitude of women In that place   
peering remarkably fair.   
As soon as we left Abbeville the iwarthiness re-  
  
turned. I speak. generally ,t• for here are some fair   
&#x27;,Women ad at, Partsorho; I think, are not whitened

Ae to rouge, they don&#x27;t pretend to imitate   
Ifltare in laying it on. There is no gradual ditninu­  
, fft °feeler from the fall bloom on the middle of the   
abed&#x27; to the faint tint near the sides ; nor does it   
chow itself differently in different faces. I have not   
yet had the boner of being at a lady&#x27;s toilet, to see   
bow It is laidat; but I fumy mould toll you how

one with Wine, tho other with water, in the corm/-

and then put both the °amines with a little glues on   
a salver, and presented It.   
The &#x27;distance from each other was streh&#x27;as that   
three other chairs Might have boon placed between   
any two of them. ,An officer-of the court brought   
na up through the crowd of spectators, and placed   
Sir John so as to stand&#x27; between the Ring and Ma­  
dame &#x27;Adelaide, and me between the Queen and   
Madame&#x27; Vietoire, The King talked a good deal   
to Sir John, neking.many questions about our royal   
family ; and did me, too, the honor of taking some   
notice of me. That&#x27;s saying enough; for I-would   
not hare&#x27; yorv.think me so much pleased with this   
Pug and Queen as to have a whit less regard than   
IWed.to Anse favours. No Frenchman- then go   
beyond me in thinking my own Ilinfeand Queen   
the very best in the world, and the most amiable.   
The civilities we everywhere metre give us the   
strongest impressions of French politeness. It   
eceine to,,b• a point settled here universally, that   
strangers, are to be treated with respect; and one   
has just the seine deferenee shown one hen, ltj   
being a stranger, as&#x27; In. England by being a lady.

Travelling is one way of lengthening lives, at

through makes it seam equal to six months living

They told meT had become twenty yearsyounger,

Pa uts, Sept. 14. It (&#x27;?&lt;.  
De v k Polly:?1 am always pleased with  
a letter from you, and 1 flatter myself that  
Vihi uiav he sometimes .please* 1 with one  
from me, though it should he ot little impor­  
tance, fueh as this, wliiiJi is to consist ot a  
few occasional remarks made here, ami on  
my journey hither.  
&quot;Soon after I left you in that agreeable So­  
ciety at Bromley, I took the resolution ot  
making a trip with Sir John Priugle into  
France. We set out ou the 2Sth past. All  
the wav to Dover we w ere furnished with  
post-chaises hung so as to lean forward, the  
top coming dqwn over one&#x27;s eyes like a hood,  
as if to prevent one&#x27;s seeing the country,  
which being one of my greatest pleasures. 1  
was engaged in jwrpetual disputes with the  
inn-keepers and postilions about getting the  
straps taken up a hole or two before, and let  
down as much behind, they insisting the :  
chaise leaning forw ard was an ease to the  
horsesi and that the contrary would kill  
them. They added their reasons for this, ,  
which were no reasons at all. and made me, i  
as upon a hundred other occasions, almost j  
wish that mankind had not been endowed  
with a reasoning faculty, since they know  
m? little how to make use of it. ami so often  
mislead themselves bv it, and that they had  
been furnished with a good .sensible instinct  
instead of it.  
At Dover the next morning, we embarked |  
for Calais with a number of passengers w ho (  
had not been before at sea. They would j  
previously wake a hearty breakfast, because !  
if the wind should fail we might not get over  
till pupper time. Doubtless they thought  
thut wheu they had paid for their breakfast  
they hud a right to it, and that when they ,  
had .swallowed it they were sure of it. But  
they were obliged to deliver it up. If you,  
my dear friend, ever go to sea, take my ad­  
vice, and live sparingly a day or two before­  
hand; the sickness, if anv, will be lighter,  
and sooner over. Got to Calais that day.  
Various impositions are .suffered from boat­  
men, porters, &amp;C., on both sides of the wa­  
ter. 1 knoH not which are most rapacious,  
the English or the French; but the latter &#x27;  
have, with their knavery, the most politeness.  
The roads we found equally good with  
ours in England. But then the poor pea­  
Mints complained to us sadly that they were j  
obliged to work upon the roads full two  
months in the year, w ithout being paid tor |  
their labor: whether this is true or urt, or j  
whether, like Englishman, they grumble, j  
cause or no cause, 1 have not been able fullv j  
to inform myself. The women we saw on j  
the road to Boulogne, ami in the inns and  
villages, were generally of durkcoinph xiuns;  
but arriving at Abbeville, we found  
deu change?a multitude ot women in that  
place appearing remarkably fair.  
As soon as we left Abbeville, the swarthi­  
nessreturned. I speak generally: for there  
ure some fair women as yt Paris, who, 1  
thiuk, are not whitened bv art. As to rouge,  
they don&#x27;t pretend to imitate nature in la), j  
ing it on. Titer? is no gradual diminution  
of color from the full bloom on tlo* middle  
of the cheek to the faint tint near the -ides;  
nor does it show itself differently in differ­  
ent faces. I have not yet had the honor of  
being at a lady&#x27;s toilet, to see how it is laid  
on; bat 1 fancy 1 could tell you how it is  
done. Cut a hole of three inches diameter  
in a piece of paper; place it on the side of  
your face in such a muuner as that the top  
of the hole may be just-under your eye; then  
with a brush dipped in the color, paint your  
face and paper together: so when tfie paper  
is taken off, there will remain a patch of red  
exactly the form of the hole. This is the J  
mode from the actress ou the stage upwards, j  
through all the ranks of ladies to the prin- j  
cesses of the blood: but it stops their, ib#j  
queen not using it, having in the serenity,!  
complacency, and benignity that shine so j  
eminently In (or rather through) her coun­  
tenance, sufficient beauty, though now &gt;jn  
old woman, to do extremely well without it.  
You see 1 speak of the Queen as if 1 had  
seen her, auu so 1 have; for you must know  
1 have been at Court. We went to \ er­  
suilles last Sunday, and had the honor of  
being presented to the King, lie spoke to  
ut both very graciously aud cheerfully; is a  
handsome man, has a verv lively iui;k and  
  
appears younger than lie is.  
in the evening we were at the Grand Cou­  
vert, when the family sup in public, The  
lorm of those sitting at table wan this :  
[Here a diagram is giveu, showing the  
manner in which the royal family are placed  
at the table.]  
The table, you see, was half a hollow  
square, the service gold. When either made  
a *ign for drink, the word was given by one  
of the waiters. &#x27;^1 bo ire pom U Ji&#x27;oi,&quot; or,  
&quot;.?1 bo ire /tour le. Heine,&quot; tlr. &#x27;i&#x27;hen two  
persons within the wjuare approach, one  
with wine and the other with water, in  
the carastes; each drank a little glass uf  
what they brought, and then put both the  
carastes, with a little glass on a salver; and  
preseuted it. .  
The distance from each other was such a*  
that three other chairs might have been  
placed between any two of them. An officer  
of the Court brought us up through tiie crowd  
of spectators, and placed Sir John mo as to  
stand between the King&amp;nd Madame Adelaide  
and me between the Queen and Madame Vic­  
toire. The King talked a good deal to Sir  
John,a&gt;king many questions about our roval  
family; and did me too the honor of taking  
some notice of me. That&#x27;s saving enough;  
lor 1 would not have you think me so much  
pleased with this King and Queen a^ to have  
n less regard than I used to fmre for ours.?  
No Frenchman shall g&lt;&gt; beyond me in think­  
ing my own King and Queen the very best  
in the world, and the most amiable.  
The civilities we every where received  
give us the strongest impressions of French  
politeuess. It seem* to be a point settled  
here universally, that strangers are to be  
treated with respect; and one has just the  
same deference shown one here, by boiug u  
stranger, as in Kngland bv being a lady.?  
The Coustom-house officers at Porte Sc. Den­  
nis, as we entered Paris, were about n&gt; seize  
two dozen of excellent l? &gt;rdeaux wine, &lt;;iveu  
us at Boulogne, and which we brought with  
us; but as soon as they found we were strang­  
ers, it was immediately remitted to us on  
ih it account.  
At the church of Notre Dame, where  
we went to see a magnificent illumination  
with figures, Ac., for the deceased Dauphi­  
ness, wc found an immense crowd, who  
Mere kept out by the guard; but the of­  
ficer being told we were strangers from Kng­  
land, he immediately admitted us, accompa­  
nied, and showed us everything. Why  
Uou&#x27;t we practice this urbanity to French­  
men! Why should they be allowed to out­  
Uo us in anything?  
Travelling is one way of leugtht in g lives,  
at least in appearance. It is only a fort­  
night since 1 left London, but the variety of  
scenes wo have gone through, makes it seem  
equal to six months in one place. Perhaps 1  
have suffered a greater change, too, in mv  
own person than I could have done in six  
years at home. 1 had not been here six  
days before my tailor and peruquier had  
transformed me iut&quot; h Frenchman. Only  
think what a figure 1 make in a little bag­  
jrig and naked tut?.  
  
They told me I had become twenty years  
younger, and looked &gt;ery gallant: so being  
in Paris, where the mode is to be sacredly  
followed, 1 was once very near making love  
to my friend&#x27;s wife.  
This letter will cost you a shilling; ana  
you may think it cheap when you consider  
that it eo?t me at least titty guineas to get  
into the situation that enables me to write it.  
Besides, 1 might, it 1 had staid at home, have  
wuii, perhaps, two shillings ot you at crib­  
btoe. 1&gt;\ the way, now J mention cards, let  
miTtell you that &quot;quadrille&quot; is quite out of  
fashion here, and English whist all the mode  
at Paris aud at Court.  
And pray look upon it as no small matter  
that, surrounded as I aui by the glories o  
the world, and by dissipations, and amuse­  
ments ol all sorts, 1 remember you aud J&gt;ol­  
ly, aud all the dear folks at Bromley. It is  
true I cannot help it, but must and c\cr  
&gt;diall remember you all with pleasure. Aeeu  
I add that 1 am particularly, my dear good

PARIS AND LIFE IN FRANCE.  
His first visit to paris was in 1707, and he men-­  
tions seeing the King dine in state at Versailles.  
This was king Louls xV., father of the unfortu-­  
ate well-beloved. Franklin had audience at Ver-­  
sailles. The king spoke &quot;very graciously and very  
cheerfully; is a handsome man, has a very lively  
look, and appears younger than he is.&quot; But  
Franklin was a loyal man then and no Frenchman  
should go beyond him &quot;in thinking my own King  
and Queen the very best in the world and the most  
amiable&quot;--a very loyal aspiration which did not  
prevent his signing the beclaration of Indepen-­  
dence nine years later, Paris he found &quot;a pro-­  
digious mixture of magnificence and negligence,  
with every kind of elegance, except that of clean-­  
liness, which we call tidiness.&quot; The French were

Dsan Tonnr; I am alwars pleased with a  
letter from you, and flatter myself you may­  
103.2 be sometimes pleased in receiving one from me  
though it should be of little importance, such  
 as this which is to coniat of a fow ecusonal  
remarks made here and on my fourney hither.  
 Soon after I left you in that agrecable society  
$d at Bromley I took the resolution of making a  
 trip with Sir John Pringle into France. We set  
out on the 28th post. All the way to Dover we  
were furnished with post chaises, hung so as  
a to lean forward, the top coming down over  
one&#x27;s eyes like a hood, as if to prevent one see  
ing the country, which, being one of my great  
ie he oup I s in perpetuml disputes with  
i the nkeer oter an oton ao  
getting the straps taken up a hole or two above  
and let down as much behind, they insisting  
Uleese that the chaise leaning forward was an ease  
to the horses, and that the contrary would  
kill them. I suppose the chaise leaning  
forward looks like a willingness to go forward.  
and that its hanging back shows reluctance  
They added other reasons that were no rea­  
sons at all and made me, as upon a hundred  
 other occasions almost wish that mankind had  
never, been endowed with a reasoning facull  
since they know so little how to make use of it  
and so often mislead themsolves by it, and that  
they had beon furnished with a good sensible  
instinct instead of it.  
 OA Dover the noat morning we embarked for  
S Calas wit a num ber of passenger who had  
 a e    a  
 e o e  a e  
thould tail, we might not get over till supper  
thoul  
time. Doubtless they thought that when they  
 had paid for their breaktast ther had a right to­  
t, and that when they had swallowed it they  
. were sure of it; but they had scarcely been out  
e2. half an hour before the sea laid claim to it, and  
Se hal an hour before the soa lald claim to it and  
$838 there are uncertainties even beyond those be  
  heo n tha i ao  
ses take my advice and ive sparingly a dar or  
two beforehand. The sickness, if any, will be  
t.  
lighter and sooner over. we sot to Calals that  
tir  
Various impositions are suffered from boat­  
mon, porters, and the like on both sides of the  
 water. I know not which are the most rapa­  
cious, English or French; but the latter have  
$64 with their knavery most politeness  
E2The streets we found equally good with ours  
in England, in some places paved with smooth  
e stonee like our noy streets for many miles to  
$C.t gether, and rows of trees on each side, and yet  
00 there are no turnpikes But then the poor  
neasants complained to us grlevously that they  
005 were obliged to work upon the streets full two  
months in the year without being paid for their  
labor. Whether this is true, or whether, like  
 Englishmen, they grumble, cause or no cause  
12c. I have not yet been able to inform myself  
The women we saw at Calais, on the road to  
Boulogne, and in the inns and villages, were  
lln.  
generally of dark complexion; but, arriving at  
Abbeville, we found a sudden change, a multi­  
t tude of both women and men in that place be­  
. ing remarkably fair. Whether this is owing to  
s. the small colony of spinners, wool combers, and  
 weavers, brought hither from tisand with the  
3f woollen manufactories about sixty years ago  
or to their being less exposed to the sun than  
belng  
in other places, their business keeping them  
much indoors, I know not. Perhaps, as in some  
other cases, different causes may combine in  
other  
e producing the effect, but the effect itself is cer  
tain. Ineyer was in a place of greaterindustr  
thels and looms going in every house  
As soon as we left Abbeville the swarthiness  
returned. I speak generally; for here are some  
fair women at Paris who I think are not  
whitened by art. As to rouge, they do not pre  
 tend to imitate nature in laying it on. There  
is no gradual diminution of the color from the  
full bloom in the middle of the cheek to the  
faint tint near the sides; nor does it show itself  
differently in different faces. I have not had  
the honor of being at any ladys toliet tse  
how it is laid on; but I fancy I can tell you how  
it is or may be done. Cut a hole of three inches  
in diameter in a piece of paper place i on the  
side of your face in such a manner as that the  
top of the hole may be iust under the eye. Then  
with a brush dipped in the color paint face and  
witia etogothereto when the paper is taken off  
thore will remain a round patch of red exactly  
the form of the hole. This is the mode from  
the actra on the stage upward through all  
ranks of ladtes to the princess of the blood; but­  
 atop ther the uen not en it ha  
 the pprenity complatsancr and benignity that  
hine so eminently in, or rather through, her  
$8 opuntenance sufficient beauty though now an  
eld woman, to do extremely well without it.  
 aek o the icen ae I had asen  
  
  
.  
  
her; and so I have. You must know I have  
been at court. Wo went to versailles last Sun  
day, and had the honor of being presented to  
the  
the Ring. He spoke to both of us very gra­  
ciously and very cheerfully, is a handsome  
man, has a very ilvelg look, and appeara  
rounger than he is in the evening we were at  
the Grand Couvert, where the family sup in  
public. The table was of a hollow square, the  
service gold. When either showed a sign for a  
drink the word was given by one of the waiters  
A boire bour le Roil or A boire pour la Reine?  
Shano no too or sobot wor o iich  
two persons came from within, one  
wine and the other with water in carafes  
Each drank a little glass of what he brought  
and then put both the carafes, with a glass, on  
a salver, and then presented it. Their distance  
from each other was such as that other chairs  
might have been placed between any two of  
them. An officer of the court brought us up  
through the crowd of spectators, and placed  
Sir John so as to stand between the Queen and  
Mme. Victoire. The King talked a great deal  
to Sir John, asking many questions about our  
royal family, and did me, too, the honor of  
taking some notice of me; that is saying  
enough, for I would not have you think me so  
much pleased with this King and Queen as to  
have a whit less regard than I used to have for  
ours. No Frenchman shall go beyond me in  
thinking my own King and Queen the best in  
the world and the most amiable.  
Versailles has had infinite sums laid out in  
bullding it and supplying it with water. Bome  
say the expense exceeded eighty million ster­  
ling. The range of buildings is immense, the  
garden front most magnificent, all of hewn  
stone; the number of statues, figures, urns  
e in marble and bronze of exquisite work­  
manship is beyond conception. But the water­  
works are out of repair, and so is a great part  
of the front next the town, looking, with its  
shabby, half-brick walls and broken windows  
not much better than the houses in Durham  
Yard. There is, in short, both at Versailles and  
Paris, a prodigious mixture of magnificence  
and negligence, with every kind of elegance  
except that of cleanliness and what we call  
tidiness, though I must do Paris the justice to  
say that in two points ofcleanliness they excoed  
. The water they drink, though from the  
river, they render as pure as that of the best  
spring by filtering it through cisterns filled  
with sand, and the streets, with constant  
sweeping, are fit to walk in, though there is no  
paved footpath. Accordingly, many well  
dressed people are constantly seen walking in  
them. The crowd of conches and chairs for  
ihls reason is not so grent. Men as well as  
women carry umbrellas in their hands, which  
they extend in case of rain or too much sun; a  
man with an umbrella not taking up more  
than three-feet square, or nine square feet of  
the street, when if in a coach he would take up  
240 square feet, you can easily conceive that  
though the streets here are narrow, they may  
be much less encumbered. They are extreme  
ly well paved, and, the stones being generally  
cubes, when worn on one side may be turned  
and become new.  
The civilities we everywhere receive give us  
the strongest impression of the French polite  
ness. It seems to be a point sottled here unt­  
versally that strangers are to be treated with  
respect; and one has just the same deference  
shown one here by being a stranger as in Eng  
land by being a lady. The Custom House  
officers at Porte St. Denis, as we entered Paris  
were about to seize two dozen of excellent Bor  
deaux wine given us at Boulogne, which we  
brought with us; but as soon as they found we  
were strangers it was immediately remitted on  
that account. At the Church of Notre Dame  
where we went to see a magnificent illumina­  
tion with figures, &amp;c., for the deceased Dau  
phiness, we found an immense crowd, which  
were kept out by guards; but the officer being  
told that we were strangers from England, he  
immediately admitted us accompanied, and  
showed us everything. Why don&#x27;t we prac  
tise this urbanity of Frenchmen? Why should  
they be allowed to outdo us in anything  
Here is an exhibition of paintings like others  
in London to which multitudes flock daily. I  
am not connoisseur enough to judge which has  
the most merit. Every night, Sundays not ex  
cepted, here are plays or operas; and though  
the weather has been hot and the houses full  
one is not incommoded by the heat so much  
as with us in winter. They must have some­  
way of changing the air that we are not ac­  
quainted with. I shall inguire into it  
Travelling is one way of lengthening life, at  
least in appearance. It is but a fortnight since  
we left London, but the variety of scenes  
which we have gone through makes it seem  
equal to six months&#x27; living in one place. Per­  
haps I have suffered a greater change too in  
my own person than I could have done in six  
years at home. I have not been here six  
months, but my tailor and perruquier have  
transformed me into a Frenchman. Only think  
what a gure I make, in a little bag wig and  
with naked ears! They told me I was become  
twenty years younger, and looked very gallant.  
This letter shall cost you a shilling, but you  
may consider it cheap when you reflect that it  
has cost me at least ufty to get into the situa­  
tion which anables me to write it. Besides I  
should. if Thad stared at home have won per­  
haps, two shillings off you at cribbage. By the  
way, now mentioning cards, lot me tell you  
that the quadrille is out of fashion here and  
English whist all the mode at Paris and in court.  
Pray look upon it as no small matter that  
surrounded as I am by the glories of the world  
and amusements of all sorts, I remember you  
and Dolly and all the dear good folks at Brom  
ler. It is true acant hein itabut must andI  
ever shall remember you all with pleasure  
Need I add that I am particularly, my dear  
good friend, yours most affectionately
