r of the 2d—postmarked 3d—was  
received this morning, after the departure of the mail. I immediately set about ascertaining what the law of Maryland was  
on the point in question, at the time of the cession: this being the law of Washington county in the District of Columbia,  
unless altered by act of Congress, which, I have ascertained, has not been done.  
The act of the Legislature of Maryland 1798, &quot;for amending &amp; reducing into System, the laws and  
regulations concerning last wills and testaments&quot; is now the rule here. It provides that &quot;all

in the presence of the said devisor, by three or four credible  
witnesses, or else they shall be utterly void &amp; of none effect.&quot;

wills made out of the state, I found a passage which allowed, by  
implication, that such a will might be valid without witnesses. In the hope that it might be so, I had recourse  
to Mr Maxcy, now Solicitor of the Treasury, one of the most eminent maryland practitio
