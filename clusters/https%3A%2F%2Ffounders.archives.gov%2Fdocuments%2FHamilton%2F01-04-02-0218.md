[New York, March 12, 1788]  
  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
THE mode of appointment of the chief magistrate of the United States is almost the only part of the system, of any consequence, which has escaped without severe censure, or which has received the slightest mark of approbation from its opponents. The most plausible of these, who has appeared in print, has even deigned to admit, that the election of the president is pretty well guarded.  
  
Vide Federal Farmer.  
  
I venture somewhat further; and hesitate not to affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages; the union of which was to be desired.  
It was desireable, that the sense of the people should operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. This end will be answered by committing the right of making it, not to any pre-established body, but to men, chosen by the people for the special purpose, and at the particular conjuncture.  
It was equally desirable, that the immedate election should be made by men most capable of analizing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favourable to deliberation and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements, which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to so complicated an investigation.  
It was also peculiarly desirable, to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government, as the president of the United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief. The choice of several to form an intermediate body of electors, will be much less apt to convulse the community, with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. And as the electors, chosen in each state, are to assemble and vote in the state, in which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.  
Nothing was more to be desired, than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their aproaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the union? But the convention have guarded against all danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious attention. They have not made the appointment of the president to depend on any pre-existing bodies of men who might be tampered with before hand to prostitute their votes; but they have referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the people of America, to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary and sole purpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from eligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the president in office. No senator, representative, or other person holding a place of trust or profit under the United States, can be of the number of the electors. Thus, without corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at least enter upon the task, free from any sinister byass. Their transient existence, and their detached situation, already taken notice of, afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so, to the conclusion of it. The business of corruption, when it is to embrace so considerable a number of men, requires time, as well as means. Nor would it be found easy suddenly to embark them, dispersed as they would be over thirteen states, in any combinations, founded upon motives, which though they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might yet be of a nature to mislead them from their duty.  
Another and no less important desideratum was, that the executive should be independent for his continuance in office on all, but the people themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was necessary to the duration of his official consequence. This advantage will also be secured, by making his re-election to depend on a special body of representatives, deputed by the society for the single purpose of making the important choice.  
All these advantages will be happily combined in the plan devised by the convention; which is, that the people of each state shall choose a number of persons as electors, equal to the number of senators and representatives of such state in the national government, who shall assemble within the state and vote for some fit person as president. Their votes, thus given, are to be transmitted to the seat of the national government, and the person who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will be the president. But as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre on one man and as it might be unsafe to permit less than a majority to be conclusive, it is provided, that in such a contingency, the house of representatives shall select out of the candidates, who shall have the five highest numbers of votes, the man who in their opinion may be best qualified for the office.  
This process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of president, will seldom fall to the lot of any man, who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single state; but it will require other talents and a different kind of merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of president of the United States. It will not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters preeminent for ability and virtue. And this will be thought no inconsiderable recommendation of the constitution, by those, who are able to estimate the share, which the executive in every government must necessarily have in its good or ill administration. Though we cannot acquiesce in the political heresy of the poet who says—  
  
“For forms of government let fools contest—  
“That which is best administered is best.”  
  
—yet we may safely pronounce, that the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration.  
The vice-president is to be chosen in the same manner with the president; with this difference, that the senate is to do, in respect to the former, what is to be done by the house of representatives, in respect to the latter.  
The appointment of an extraordinary person, as vice president, has been objected to as superfluous, if not mischievous. It has been alledged, that it would have been preferable to have authorised the senate to elect out of their own body an officer, answering that description. But two considerations seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this respect. One is, that to secure at all times the possibility of a definitive resolution of the body, it is necessary that the president should have only a casting vote. And to take the senator of any state from his seat as senator, to place him in that of president of the senate, would be to exchange, in regard to the state from which he came, a constant for a contingent vote. The other consideration is, that as the vice-president may occasionally become a substitute for the president, in the supreme executive magistracy, all the reasons, which recommend the mode of election prescribed for the one, apply with great, if not with equal, force to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable, that in this as in most other instances, the objection, which is made, would be against the constitution of this state. We have a Lieutenant Governor chosen by the people at large, who presides in the senate, and is the constitutional substitute for the Governor in casualties similar to those, which would authorise the vice-president to exercise the authorities and discharge the duties of the president.  
PUBLIUS.

which it has in fact produced in the great majority of instances,  
in which this arrangement has obtained. The Convention were  
fully impressed with the truth and cogency of this objection.  
They deemed it indispensable, however, that the sense of the  
people should operate in the choice of the person, to whom the  
highest national trust was to be ‘confided. At the same time,  
it appeared to them material, that the zmmedzate election should  
be made “by men most capable of analyzing the qualities  
“adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances fa-  
‘“ vourable to honest and calm deliberation.”

answer these several ends. The constitution denies to the peo-  
ple at large the immediate election of the president, but pro-  
vides “ that each state shall choose a number of persons as  
** electors, equal to the number of senators and representatives  
“of such state in the national goverpment, and that these  
“electors shall assemble to vote by ballot within the state, on  
“a day to be determined by congress, which shall be the same  
“throughout all the states.” The votes thus given are to be  
transmitted under seal to the seat of the national government,  
and to be directed to the president of the senate. It is also  
enacted by the constitution, that no senator, representative or  
other person, holding a place of trust or profit under the  
United States, can be of the number of the electors.  
  
This scheme of election is obviously of the happiest concep-

“It was,” says general Hamilton, “ peculiarly desirable to afford as little  
opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder inthe choice of the executive.  
This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate who  
was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government.  
But the precautions which have been so happily concetted in the system un-  
der consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief. The  
choice of sevexa., toform an intermediate body of electors, will be much  
less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent move-  
ments, than the choice of ont, who was himself to be the final object of the  
public wishes. As the electors, chasen in each state, are to assemble and  
yote in the state in which they are chosen, this detached and divided situa-  
tion will expose them much less to heats and ferments, that might.be com-  
municated from them to the people, than if they were all to be convened at  
one time, in one place.  
  
“ Nothing was more to be desired, than that every practicable obstacle”  
should be opposed to cabal, intrigue and corruption. These most deadly ad-  
versaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to  
make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the de-  
sire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How  
could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the  
chief magistracy of the Union. But the Convention have guarded against all  
danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious attention. They  
have not made the appointment of the president to depend on preexisting  
bodies. of men, who might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their  
votes; but they have referred in the first instance to an immediate act of the  
people of America, to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary  
and sole purpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from  
eligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be suspected of  
too great devotion to the president in office. Thus, without corrupting the  
body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at least enter  
upon the task, free from any sinister bias. Their transient existence, and  
their detached situation, already noticed, afford a satisfactory prospect of  
their continuing so, to the conclusion of it. The business of corruption, when  
it is to embrace so considerable a number of men, requires time, as well as  
means. Nor would it be found easy suddenly to embark them, dispersed, as  
they would be, over thirteen states, in any combinations founded upon mo-  
tives, which, though they could not properly be denominated corrupt, might  
yet be of a nature to mislead them from their duty.  
  
** Another, and no less important desideratum was, that the executive  
should be independent for his continuance in office, on ail, but the people  
themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duty to his com-  
plaisance for those whose favour was necessary to the duration of his official  
consequence. This advantage will also be secured, by making his reclection  
to depend on a special body of representatives, deputed by the society for  
the single purpose of making the important choice.”  
  
To settle the term for which the president was to be elected,  
must have been a matter of some perplexity for the Conven-  
tion. Sound policy dictated, that the period should not be s

“Nothing was more to bé desired, than that every  
practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, in-  
trigue and corruption.”—“They have not made the  
appointment of the president to depend on pre-ex-  
isting bodies of men, who might be tampered with  
beforehand to prostitute their votes; but they have  
referred it, in the first instance, toan immediate act  
of the people of America, to be exerted in the  
choice of persons, for the temporary and sole pur-  
pose of making the appointment. And they baye  
excluded from eligibility to this trust, all those who,  
from situation, might be suspected of too great de-  
votion to the president in office. No senator, re-  
  
presentative, or other person holding a place of  
  
trust or profit under the U. States, can be of the  
number of the electors. Thus, without corrupting  
the body of the people, the immediate agents in the  
election will, at least, enter upan the task free from  
any sinister bias. ‘Their transient existence and  
their cetached situation, afford a satisfactory pros-  
pect of their continuing so, to the conclusion of it.”  
  
‘Another, and no less important, desideratum  
was, that the executive should be independent, jo:  
his continuance in office, of all, but the people them-  
selves. He might otherwise be tempted to sacri-  
fice his duty to his complaisance for those whose  
favor was necessary to the duration of his official  
consequence.”

other public business during the whole revolution.  
  
Many of the numbers in that work were written by  
Mr. Madison and Mr. Hamilton together, and the  
whole view of the constitution, there taken, was ad-  
justed and arranged by them in the outset. Itis in  
this work Mr. Madison most distinguished himself  
asa political writer. Let us see how the mode of  
choosing the president was then considered by men,  
who devised and recommended it.  
  
“It was desirable,” (says the Federalist), «that  
the sense of the people should operate in the choice  
of the person, to whom so important a trust was to  
be confided. This end will be answered by com-  
mitting the right of making it, {the choice], not te  
  
any pre-established body, but to men, chosen by the

«These most deadly adversaries of republican go-  
vernment,” the Federalist adds, “might be expect-  
ed from more than one quarter.” And this, by the  
way, was the principal objection to this part of the  
constitution, both among the people and in the state  
conventions, especially the state of Virginia. It was  
particularly feared, that a desire in foreign powers  
(uy interfere in our concerns, or combinations of in-  
ttuential men at home, would be able to gain an as-  
cendancy in our councils, and that this would be  
most likely to be done by procuring the election of  
‘a creature of their own to the chi¢f magistracy of  
the union,”  
  
“But,” says the Federalist, “the convention have  
cuarded against all danger of this sort with a most  
provident and judicious attention, They have not  
made the appointment of president to depend on  
pre-existing bodies of men, who might be tampered  
with Jeforehand to prostitute their votes; but they  
have referred it, [the appointment], in the rst in-  
stance, toan immediate act of the people of America,  
to be exerted in the choice of persons for the tem-  
  
porary and sole purpose of making the appointment.’  
  
And they have excluded from eligibility to this trast,  
‘that of electors] all those who, from situation, might  
be suspected of too great devotion to the president  
in office.”

«Another and no less important desideratum was,  
that the executive should be independent, for his  
coutinuance in office, on all but the people themselves.

to his complisance forthose, whose favor was neces-

© It must be recollected, that it was often proposed  
in the United States convention, to authorize the  
national legislature to elect the president—but that  
‘proposition was as often rejected. Other proposi-

states—then the state governments—should elect  
him; all which were at once rejected. Judge Wil-

By reference to the Federalist LXVIf, we  
find that, speaking of the election of the. Presi­  
dent, 4 It was desirable, that the sense of the  
4 people should operate in the choice of the  
4 person to w hom so important a trust was to  
4 be confided. This end will be answered by  
4 committing the right of making it, not to any  
4 pre-established body, hut to men chosen by  
4 the people, for the special purpose, and at the  
‘ particular conjuncture.”  
Again. ‘ Another, and no less important, de­  
sideratum was that the executive should be  
4 independent for his continuance in office, on  
&#x27;alt, but the people themselves. IJe might  
4 otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duly  
4 to his complaisance for those whose favor  
4 was necessary to the duration of his cdliciul

making &quot;the sense of the people operate,&quot; yet  
that is the only one, and no merit can be infer­  
red therelrom to the plan generally, because  
this end is not peculiar to that plan, and be­  
cause it has been eflectuated in a degree so far  
beyond what was intended, that it not only  
runs counter to the theory of the whole plan,  
but has disappointed all the other results anti­  
cipated from it.  
  
Second. &quot;It was desirable thatjthe immedi­  
ate election should he made by men most ca­  
pable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the  
station, and acting under circumstances favor­  
able to deliberation and to a judicious combin­

were proper to govern their choice. A small  
number of persons, selected from the general  
mass, will be most likely to possess the in­  
formation and discernment requisite to so com­  
plicated an investigation.&quot;  
Here we have the true theory of the whole  
plan. The electors were to be a body of men,  
selected for their virtue and intelligence, who,  
untrammelled and uncommitted by pledges or  
instructiins, were to have surrendered to them  
the whole power of choosing the President.  
The people were to make a volunary surrender  
of their ovyn predilection into hands of the elec­  
tors, trusting everything to their unbiassed in­  
telligence. Popular sentiment was to have n

were allowed to express their preference for  
any one man, but each elector was required to  
vote for two men as President.  
Third. &quot;It was peculiarly desirable to afford  
as little opportunity as possible for tumult and  
disorder. This evil was not the least of those  
to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate  
who was to have so important an agency in the  
administration of t!;e Government. But the  
precautions that have been happily concerted in  
the system under consideration, promise effectu­  
al security against this mischief. The choice of  
several, to lorm an intermediate body of elec­  
tors. will be much less apt lo convulse the com­  
munity with any extraordinary or violent move­  
ments than the choice of one, who was himself  
te be tlie final object of the public wishes. As  
the electors are to assemble and vote in tae  
State in which they are chosen, they will be  
much less exposed to heats and ferments,which  
might be communicated from them to the peo­  
ple, than if they were all convened togeth­  
er,&quot;  
Here is specified, as the most prominent evil  
in the electinga Chief Magistrate, that popular  
ferment and strife, which it was supposed the  
concerted precautions of the system had so  
happily guarded against. It is deservedly plac­

‘*It was equally desirable, that the immediate election  
should be made by men most capable of analyzing the quali-  
ties adapted to the station; and acting under .circumstances  
favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of  
all the reasons and inducements that were proper to govern  
their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their  
fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to  
possess the information and discernment requisite to so com-  
plicated an investigation.  
  
‘* It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportu-  
nity as ;,possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not  
least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to  
have so important an agency in the administration of the gov-  
ernment. But the precautions, which have been so happily  
concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effec-  
tual security against this mischief. The choice of several, to  
form an intermediate body of electors, will be much less apt to  
convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent  
movements, than the choice of one, who was himself to be the  
final object of the public wishes. And as the electors, chosen  
in each State, are to assemble and vote in the State in which  
they are chosen, this detached and divided situation will expose  
them much less to heats and ferments, that might be commu-  
nicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be  
convened at one time, in one place.”— Federalist, pp. 424, 425.

These most deadly adversaries of republican government,

in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our  
councils. How could they better gratify this, than by rais-

So that the writers of the Federalist thought they  
saw a satisfactory security that the veto power  
would be exercised with 44 great cautionand that  
they did not dream that the Chief Magistrate of a  
&quot;Government wholly and purely republican&quot; would  
dare to have fewer scruples about it than the Kir.g ol  
England had ! Alas, those great men, among the  
wisest of their own or of any other day, were, dfter  
all, not prophets !  
They diought they saw another ground of se­  
curity, which also experience has tailed to confirm.  
In No. 68 they say :  
44 This process of election affords a moral ccrtain­  
? ty that the otfice of President will seldom fall to  
4 the lot of any man who is not in an eminent de­  
4 gree endowed with the requisite qualifications.

4 the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion

4 bility of seemg the station filled by characters pre­  
4 eminent for ability and virtue.&quot;  
The construction of the veto power given by  
Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, in the argument by  
which they endeavored to propitiate the 1 eople to  
the Constitution, had before prevailed in the Con­  
vention; it became, on the adoption ol the Consti­

eminent writer in the Federalist makes some  
suggestion in relation to the Presidency which  
ought to be seriously pondered in those later days.  
He says: - 1  
&quot; The office of President will seldom fall to  
the lot of any man who is not in an eminent de­  
cree endowed with the requisite qualifications.  
Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popu­  
larity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the  
first honors of a State; but it will require other  
talents and a different kind of merit to establish  
him in the esteem and confidence of the whole  
Union or of so considerable a portion of it as would  
be necessary to make him a successful candidate  
for the distinguished office of President of the Uni­

ton? In the same article from which we have  
quoted, he says: &quot;It was also peculiarly desirable  
to afford as little opportunity as possible to tu­  
mult and disorder. (Vide Charleston.) This evil  
was not, at least, to be desired in the clection of a  
magistrate, who was to have so important an  
agency in the administration of the Government.  
But the precautions which have been so happily  
concerted in the system under consideration, pro­  
mise an effective seourity against this mischief.  
The choice of severaf to form an intermediate body  
of electors, will be much less apt to convulse the  
communities, with any extraordinary or violent  
movements, than the choice of one who was him­  
self to be the final object of the public wishes.  
And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to  
assemble and vote in the State in which they are  
chosen, this detached and divided situation will  
expose them much less to heats and ferments, (a  
la Charleston,) that might be communicated to  
them from the people, than if they were all to be  
collected at one time, in one place.&quot;  
If Hamilton had had Charleston in his eye, he  
could not have more accurately portrayed what  
was enacted there. But further, he adds: &quot;No­  
thing was more to be desired than that every  
practicable obstacle should be exposed to cabal,  
intrigue and corruption.  But the  
Convention have guarded against all danger of  
this sort, with the most prudent and judicious at­  
tention. They have not made the appointment of  
the President to depend on preexisting bodies of  
men, wiso might be tampered with befo rehand to  
prostitute their votes; but they have referred it in  
the first instance to an immediate act of the peo­  
ple of America, to be exerted in the cboice of  
persons for the temporury and sole purpose of m­  
king the appointsient. And they have excluded  
from eligibility to this trust, and those who, rom  
sitnation seight be suspected of too great derotion to  
the President in opice. No Senator, Representative,  
or other person holding a place af frust or profit  
under the United States, can be of the num ber of  
the electors. Thus, wwithout corrupting the body  
of the people, the immediate agents in the eleestion,  
will, at least, enter upon the task, free fromt any  
sinister bias.&quot; We cite one more extract fro

the States. Finally, if the House does not  
choose a President when the duty devolve*  
upon it, then the Vice-President acts as  
President, as in case of the a uh or other  
constitutional disability of the President.  
Vice-Presidents are chosen in a pre­  
cisely similiar manner. It is not now  
intended to discus the wisdom of this plan,  
though we are told by the &quot;Federalist&quot;  
that the reason of its enactment was the  
opinion of the framers of the Constitution  
that the choice of several to form an inter­  
mediate body of electors was much Jess apt  
to convulse the community than the choice  
ofone,who should himsell be the final object  
of the public wishes. But however wise  
the plan may be in principle, it is certainly  
defective in practice. To pass over less  
obvious but equally fetal objections, it is  
nowhere provided what agent shall count  
the electoral votes, nor by what rules that  
agent shall be guided in its decision as to  
their regularity.  
Chancellor Kent is of opionion that in  
the absence of any legislative provision  
the President of the Senate counts the vote.  
One thing is certain if the twenty-two  
joint rule is yet in force, the President of  
the Senate has no other power or duty bui

that “ the mode of appointment of the chief magistrates of the  
United States is almost the only part of the system of any con-  
sequence which has escaped without severe censure, or which has

He adds, “ I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not to affirm  
that, if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least excellent. It  
unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the union of which  
was to be wished for.” The notion of Hamilton was that, without  
having a direct popular election, “ the sense of the people should,”  
in his words, “ operate in the choice of the person to whom so im-  
portant a trust was to be confided.” The election was not to be  
made by the Federal Legislature; he hardly discusses that possi-  
bility, which would indeed have been quite inconsistent with the  
whole theory of the Presidential office. The Executive and the  
Legislature were to be independent bodies. The election was to  
be a popular one; that is, it was to express the general feeling of  
the people at the time ; hut it was not to be made by direct popular  
election. Hamilton feared that the direct popular election of th

wishes to hinder “ cabal, intrigue, and corruption.” These, he thinks,  
might happen in the case of any “ pre-existing bodies of men ”—a  
hrase which of course takes in both the Federal Legislature and the  
cislatures of the seyeral States. He holds that such bodies

will be answered by committing the right of making it, not to any pre-

Without corrupting the body of the p-ople, the immediate agents in the  
election will at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias.  
Their transient existence and their detached situation already noticed  
afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so to the conclusion of it.  
The business of corruption, when it is to embrace so considerable a body of  
men, requires time as well as means. Nor would it be found easy suddenly  
to embark them, dispersed as they would be over thirteen States, in any  
combinations founded upon motives which, though they could not be pro-  
perly denominated corrupt, might yet be of a nature to mislead them from  
their duty.  
  
The question of the re-eligibility of the President Hamilton dis-

Another and no less important desideratum was that the executive  
should be independent for his continuance in ofiice on all but the people  
themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duty to his  
complaisance for those whose favour was necessary to the duration of his  
official consequence. This advantage will also be secured by making his re-

The mode ot appointment of the chiei  
magistrate of the United States, is almost  
the only part of the system, of any conse­  
quence, which has escaped without severe

ciicumstances lavorahle to deliberation,  
iinu iu a judicious combination of nil the  
reaspnsnd Indacenidijt that were prop­  
er to govern their choice, 1 A small r.uni-  
oir ot persons, selected by their, fellow­  
citizens Irom tho general mass, will be  
most likely to possess tho information nnd  
uisceriimeni requisite to so complicated  
an investigation.  
It was also peculiarly desirable to afl&#x27;ord  
an iimu opportunity as possible to tumult  
and disorder. This evil was not least &#x27; to  
be dreaded in tho election of A magistrate,  
who was to have so important an  
agency in tho administration ol the gov­  
ernment. But tho precautions which  
have been so happily concerted in the  
system under consideration, promise an  
effectual security against this mischief.  
The choice of several, to lorm an interme­  
diate body ol electors, will be much less  
apt to convulse the community, with any  
extraordinary or violent movements, than  
the choice ol one, who w.19 himself to bo  
the final object ol the public wishes. And  
as tho electors, chosen in each stato. aro  
t assemble and vote in the state in which  
they are chosen, this detached and divid­  
ed situation will expose them mnnh loac  
to heats and lerments, that might be com­  
municated Irom them to the people, than  
if they were all to be convened at one  
time, in one place.  
Nothing was m6re to bo desired than  
that everv practicable obstacle should h  
opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corrup  
tion, lhese most deadly adversaries of  
republican srovernment&quot; miodit nntnmliw  
have been expected to make their ap­  
proaches from nioro than one quarter, but  
chiefly from the desire in foreign powers  
to gain an improper ascendant in our  
Councils. How Could thev taller trrotilv  
this, than by raising a creatnre ot their  
own to the chief magistracy of the union ?  
But the convention have guarded aarnst  
all danger ot this sort, with the most  
provident and judicious attention. Thev  
have not made the appointment of the  
president to depend on pre-existing bod­  
ies of men, who mijrht be tampered with  
beforehand to prosiituto their votes; hni  
they have referred it in tho first instance  
to an immediate act ot the rwnn.n f  
America, to bo exerted in the choice of  
persons tor the temporary and sole pur­  
pose ot making tho appointment. And  
they have excluded from elitnMiitv  
this trust, all those who from&quot; situation  
Plight bo suspected ot too great devotion  
to the president in office. N O simntm.  
representative, or other person holding a  
place ot trust or profit under the United  
Slates, can bo of tho number of the elec­  
tors. Thus, without corrupting the body  
ot tho people, tho immediate ayents in  
tho election will at least enter upon the  
Usk. free from any sinister bias.  
This process ot election affords a moral  
certuinty, tnat tho office ot president will  
seldom fall to the lot of any man who is  
not in an eminent degree endowed with  
Vhereqnisite qualifications. Talents tot­  
low intrigue, and tho little arts of popu­  
larity, may alone suffice to eleyate a man  
to the first honors of a siugle state ; but it  
will require other talents, and a different  
kind of merit, to establish him in esteem,  
and confidence of the whole union, or o  
so considerable a portion ot it, as would  
be necessary to make him a successful  
candtdato lor the distinguished office of  
president of the United States. It will  
not be too strong to say, that there will

who did so much to bring about the  
adoption of the Constitution. He said:  
&quot;The mode of appointment of the  
chief magistrate of the United States is  
almost the only part of the system, of  
any consequence, which has escaped with­  
out severe censure, or which has received  
the slightest mark of approbation from  
its opponents. The most plausible of  
these who has appeared in print has even  
deigned to admit that the election of the  
president is pretty well guarded. I ven­  
ture somewhat further, and hesitate not  
to affirm that if the manner of it be not  
perfect, it is at least excellent. It unites  
in an eminent degree all the advantages,  
the union of which was to be wished for.  
It was desirable that the sense of the  
people should operate in the choice of the  
person to whom so important a trust was  
to be confided. This end will be an­  
swered by committing the right of mak­  
ing it, not to any pre-established body,  
but to men chosen by the people for the  
special purpose, and at the particular  
conjuncture. It was equally desirable  
that the immediate election should be  
made by men most capable of analyzing  
the qualities adapted to the station, and  
acting under circumstances favorable to  
deliberation and to a judicious combina­  
tion of all the reasons and inducements  
which were proper to govern their choice.  
A small number of persons, selected by  
their fellow-citizens from the general  
mass, will be most likely to possess the  
information and discernment requisite to  
such complicated investigations. It was  
also peculiarly desirable to afford as little  
opportunity as possible to tumult and dis­  
order. This evil was not least to be  
dreaded in the election of a magistrate  
who was to have so important an agency  
in the administration of the Government  
as the president of the United States.  
But the precautions which have been so  
happily concerted in the system under  
consideration promise an effectual se­  
curity against this mischief. The choice  
of several, to form an intermediate body  
of electors, will be much less apt to con­  
vulse the community with any extraordi­  
nary or violent movements than the  
choice of one who was himself to be the  
final object of the public wishes. And  
as the electors, chosen in each state, are  
to assemble and vote in the state in which  
they are chosen, this detached and divided  
situation will expose them much less to  
heats and ferments, which might be com­  
municated from them to the people, than  
if they were all to be convened at one  
time, in one place.  Thus, with­  
out corrupting the body of the people, the  
immediate agents in the election will at  
least enter upon the task free from any  
sinister bias. Their transient existence  
and their detached situation, already  
taken notice of, afford a satisfactory pros­  
pect of their continuing so to the conclu­  
sion of it. The business of corruption,  
when it is to embrace so considerable a  
number of men, requires time as well as  
means. Nor would it be found easy sud­  
denly to embark them, dispersed as they  
would be over thirteen states, in any com­  
binations founded upon motives which,  
though they could not properly be de­  
nominated corrupt, might yet be of a  
nature to mislead them from their duty.&quot;

have believed at that time, that unde

in one quarter or another, and the acceptance of the entire  
instrument, long doubtful, was finally secured only with great  
difficulty, this seems to have received some moderate commenda-

The Vice-President is to be chosen in the same  
manner with the President, with the difference that  
the senate is to do, in respect to the former, what is  
to be done by the house of representatives in respect  
to the latter.  
  
The appointment of an extraordinary person as  
Vice-President has been objected to as superfluous,  
if not mischievous. It has been alleged that it  
would have been preferable to have authorized the  
senate to elect out of their own body an officer answer-  
ing to that description. Bu twoconsiderations seem  
to justify the ideas o{ the convention in this respect.  
One is, that to secure at all times the possibility of a  
definitive resolution of the body, it is necessary that  
the President should have only a casting wote ; and  
to take the senator of any state from his seat as sen-  
ator, to place him in that of apresident of the senate,  
would be to exchange, in regard to the state from  
which he came, a constant for a contingent vote.  
The other consideration is, that, as the Vice Presi-  
dent may occasionally become a substitute for the  
President, in the supreme executive magistracy, all  
the reasons which recommend the mode of election  
prescribed for the one, apply with great, if not with  
equal, force to the manner of appointing the other.  
It is remarkable that, in this, as in most other in-  
stances, the objection which is made would lie against  
the constitution of this state. We havea lieutenant-  
governor, chosen by the people at large, who pre-  
sides in the senate, and is the constitutional substi
