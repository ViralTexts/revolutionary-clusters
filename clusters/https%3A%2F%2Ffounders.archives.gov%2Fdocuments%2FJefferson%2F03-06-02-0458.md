 is it not instantly restored to circulation

but say more correctly, the speculators and spendthrifts of  
N.  
York &amp;  
Pensylva, but never consider them as being  
the states of  
N.  
York and  
Pensylvania. these two items shall be  
considered together.  
It is a  
litigated question whether the circulation of paper, rather than of specie, is  
a good or an evil. in the opinion of  
England and of English writers it is a good; in  
that of all other nations it is an evil: and excepting  
England, and her copyist the  
US. there is not a nation existing, I believe,  
which tolerates a paper circulation. the experiment is going on however,  
desperately in  
England, pretty boldly with us, and at the end of  
the chapter, we shall see which opinion experience approves. for I believe it  
to be one of those cases where mercantile clamor will bear down reason, until  
it is corrected by ruin. in the mean time however let us reason on this new  
call for a National bank.  
After the solemn decision  
of  
Congress  
against the renewal of the charter of the  
bank of the US.  
and the grounds of that decision, the want of  
constitutional power, I had imagined that question at rest, and that no more  
applications would be made to them for the incorporation of banks. the  
opposition on that ground to it’s first establishment, the small majority by  
which it was overborne, and the means practised for obtaining it, cannot be  
already forgotten. the law having passed however by a Majority,  
the  
it’s opponents,  
true to the sacred principle of  
acc  
submission to a majority, suffered the  
law to flow thro’ it’s term without  
obstruction. during this, the nation had time to consider  
the constitutional question, and when the renewal was proposed, they condemned  
it, not by their representatives in  
Congress only  
but by express instructions from different organs of their will. here then we  
might stop, and consider the memorial as answered. but, setting authority  
apart, we will examine whether the  
legislature  
ought to comply with it, even if they had the power.  
Proceeding to reason on this subject,  
some principles must be premised as forming it’s basis. the adequate price of a  
thing depends on the capital &amp; labor necessary to produce it. (in the term  
capital, I mean to  
include science, because capital as well as labor has been employed to acquire  
it.) two things requiring the same capital and labor, should be of the same  
price. if a gallon of wine requires for it’s production the same capital &amp;  
labor with a bushel of wheat, they should be expressed by the same price  
derived from the application of a common measure to them. the  
comparative prices of things being thus to be estimated, and expressed by a  
common measure, we may proceed to observe that were a country so insulated as  
to have no commercial intercourse with any other, to confine the interchange of  
all it’s wants and supplies within itself, the amount of circulating medium as  
a common measure for adjusting these exchanges would be quite immaterial. if  
their circulation for instance were of a million of  
dollars, and the annual produce of their industry equivalent to ten  
millions of bushels of wheat, the price of a bushel of wheat might be  
1.D. if then by a progressive coinage their  
medium should be doubled, the price of a bushel of wheat might become  
progressively 2.D. and without inconvenience.  
whatever be the proportion of the circulating medium to the value of the annual  
produce of industry, it may be considered as the representative of that  
industry. in the first case a bushel of wheat will be represented by  
1.D. in the second by 2.D.  
this  
is well explained by  
Hume,  
and seems admitted by  
Adam  
Smith B.2. c.2. 436. 441. 490. but where a nation is in a full  
course of interchange of wants and supplies with all others, the proportion of  
it’s medium to it’s produce is no longer indifferent. ib. 441. to trade on  
equal terms the common measure of values should be as nearly as possible on a  
par with that of it’s corresponding nations whose medium is in a sound state;  
that is to say, not in an accidental state of excess or deficiency. now one of  
the great advantages of specie as a medium is that, being of universal value,  
it will keep itself at a general level, flowing out from where it is too high,  
into parts where it is lower. whereas, if the medium be of local value only, as  
paper money, if too little indeed, gold &amp; silver will flow in to supply the  
deficiency; but if too much, it accumulates, banishes the gold &amp; silver not  
locked up in vaults and hoards, and depreciates itself; that is to say, it’s  
proportion to the annual produce of industry being raised, more of it is  
required to represent any particular article of produce than in the other  
countries. this is agreed by  
Smith (B.2. c.2. 437.) the principal advocate for  
a paper circulation; but advocating it on the sole condition that it be  
strictly regulated. he admits nevertheless that ‘the commerce and industry of a  
country cannot be so secure when suspended on the Daedalian wings of paper  
money, as on the solid ground of gold and silver; and that in time of war, the  
insecurity is greatly increased, and great confusion possible where the  
circulation is for the greater part in paper.’ B.2. c.2. 484. but in a country  
where loans are uncertain, and a specie circulation the only sure resource for  
them, the preference of that circulation assumes a far different degree of  
importance, as is explained in my  
former letters.  
  
The only advantage which  
Smith proposes by substituting paper in the room  
of gold and silver money, B.2. c.2. 434. is ‘to replace an expensive instrument  
with one much less costly, and sometimes equally convenient’: that is to say, pa. 437. ‘to allow the gold and silver  
to be sent abroad and converted into foreign goods’ and to substitute paper as  
being a cheaper measure. but this makes no addition to the stock or capital of  
the nation. the coin sent out was worth as much, while in the country, as the  
goods imported &amp; taking it’s place. it is only then a change of form in a  
part of the national capital, from that of gold and silver to other goods. he  
admits too that while a part of the goods recieved in exchange for the coin  
exported, may be ‘materials, tools  
and provisions for the emploiment of an additional industry, a part also may be  
taken back in foreign wines, silks Etc. to be consumed by idle people who produce  
nothing; and so far the substitution promotes prodigality, increases expence  
&amp; consumption, without increasing production.’ so far also then it lessens  
the capital of the nation. what may be the amount which the conversion of the  
part exchanged for productive goods may add to the former productive mass, it  
is not easy to ascertain, because, as he says, pa. 441. it is impossible to  
determine what is the proportion which the circulating money of any country  
bears to the whole value of the annual produce. it has been computed by  
different authors from a 5th to a 30th of that value. in the  
US. it must be less than in any other part of the  
commercial world; because the great mass of their inhabitants being in  
responsible ci

rcumstances, the great mass of their exchanges in the country is  
effected, on credit, in their merchant’s ledger, who supplies all their wants  
thro’ the year, and at the end of it, recieves the produce of their farms, or  
other articles of their industry. it is a fact that a farmer with a revenue of  
10,000 D. a year, may obtain all his supplies  
from his merchant, and liquidate them at the end of the year, by the sale of  
his produce to him, without the intervention of a single dollar of cash. this  
then is merely barter, and in this way of barter a great portion of the annual  
produce of the  
US. is exchanged without the intermediation of  
cash. we might safely then state our medium at the minimum of  
¹⁄₃₀. but what is  
¹⁄₃₀ of the value of the annual produce of the  
industry of the  
US? or what is the whole value of the  
annual  
produce of the  
US? an able writer and competent judge of the  
subject in 1799. on as good grounds as probably could be taken estimated it, on  
the then population of 4½ millions of inhabitants, to be 37½  
millions sterling, or 168¾  
M. of Dollars.  
see  
Cooper’s  
Political arithmetic 47. according to the same  
estimate for our present population it will be 300.M. of  
Dollars, ¹⁄₃₀ of which,  
Smith’s minimum, would be  
10.M. and ⅕,  
his maximum, would be 60.M. for the quantum  
of circulation. but suppose that, instead of our needing the least circulating  
medium of any nation, from the circumstance before mentioned, we should place  
ourselves in the middle term of the calculation, to wit at  
35. millions. one fifth of this  
Smith at the least,  
Smith thinks should be retained in specie, which  
would leave 28. millions of specie to be  
exported in exchange for other commodities; and if 15  
M. of that should be returned in productive goods, and not in  
articles of prodigality, that would be the amount of capital which this  
operation would add to the existing mass. but to what mass? not that of the  
300.M. which is only it’s gross annual  
produce; but to that capital of which the 300.M. are but the  
annual produce.  
but this being gross, we may  
infer from it the value  
profit of the capital by  
considering that the rent of lands is generally fixed at one third of the gross  
produce, and is deemed it’s nett profit, and twenty times that it’s feesimple  
value. the profits on landed capital, may, with accuracy enough for

purpose, be supposed on a par, with those of other capital. this would give us  
then for the  
US. a capital of 2000.  
millions, all in active employment, and exclusive of unimproved  
lands lying in a great degree dormant. of this, 15  
millions would be the hundred and thirty third part. and it is  
for this petty addition to  
the capital of the nation, this minimum of 1.D. added to  
133⅓ or ¾ p.c.  
that we are to give up our gold &amp; silver medium, it’s intrinsic solidity,  
it’s universal value, and it’s saving powers in time of war, and to substitute  
for it paper, with all it’s train of evils, moral, political and physical,  
which I will not pretend to enumerate.  
There is another authority, to which we may appeal for the  
proper quantity of circulating medium for the  
US. the old  
Congress, when  
we were estimated at  
about two millions of people on a long and  
able discussion,  
June 22. 1775. decided the sufficient  
quantity to be two millions of Dollars  
which sum they then emitted;  
*  
within 5. months after this they were compelled by the necessities of the war  
to abandon the idea of emitting only an adequate circulation, and to make those  
necessities the sole measure of their emissions.  
according to  
this it should be  
8.M. now that we are 8.M. of people. this  
differs little from  
Smith’s minimum of 10.M. and strengthens our respect for that  
estimate.  
There is indeed a  
convenience in paper, it’s easy transmission from one place to another. but  
this may be mainly supplied by bills of exchange, so as to prevent any great  
displacement of coin  
actual coin. two places trading together balance their dealings for the most  
part, by their mutual supplies, and the debtor individuals of either may, instead of cash, remit the bills of those who are creditors in the  
same dealings; or may obtain them through some third place with which both have  
dealings. the cases would be rare where such bills could not be obtained,  
either directly or circuitously, and too unimportant to the nation to  
our  
overweigh the train of evils flowing from paper  
circulation.  
From  
8. to 35. millions then being our proper  
circulation and 200.M. the actual one, the  
Memorial proposes to issue 90.M. more  
because, it says, a great scarcity of money is proved by the numerous  
applications for banks, to wit,  
N.  
York for 18.M.  
Pensylvania 10.M. Etc. the answer to this shall be quoted from  
Adam Smith B.2. c.2. pa. 462. where speaking of  
the complaints of the traders against the Scotch bankers, who had already gone  
too far in their issues of paper, he says ‘those traders and  
other undertakers having got so much  
assistance from banks wished to get still more.  
the banks, they seem to have thought, could extend their  
credits to whatever sum might be wanted, without  
incurring any other expence besides that of a few reams of paper. they  
complained of the contracted views and dastardly spirit of the Directors of  
those banks, which did not, they said, extend their credits in proportion to  
the extension of the trade of the country; meaning, no doubt, by the extension  
of that trade, the extension of their own projects beyond what they could carry  
on, either with their own  
capital, or with what they had credit to borrow of private people in  
the usual way of bond or mortgage. the banks, they seem to have thought, were  
in honor bound to supply the deficiency, and to provide them with all the  
capital which they wanted to trade with.’ and again pa. 470. ‘when bankers  
discovered that certain projectors were trading, not with any capital of their  
own, but with that which they advanced them, they endeavored to withdraw  
gradually, making every day greater and greater difficulties about  
discounting.—these difficulties alarmed &amp; enraged in the highest degree  
those projectors. their own distress, of which this prudent and necessary  
reserve of the banks was no doubt the immediate occasion, they called the  
distress of the country; and this distress of the country, they said, was  
altogether owing to the ignorance, pusillanimity, and bad conduct of the banks,  
which did not give a sufficiently liberal aid to the spirited undertakings of  
those who exerted themselves in order to beautify, improve, and enrich the  
country. it was the duty of the banks, they seemed to think, to lend for as  
long a time, and to as great an extent, as they might wish to borrow.’ it is  
probably the good  
paper of these projectors which the Memorial  
says the banks being unable to discount, goes into the hands of  
brokers, who (knowing the risk of this  
good paper) discount it  
at a much higher rate than legal interest, to the great distress  
of the enterprising adventurers who had rather try trade on borrowed capital  
than go to the plough or other laborious calling.  
Smith again says pa. 478. ‘that the industry of  
Scotland languished for want of money to employ  
it, was the opinion of the famous  
mr  
Law. by establishing a bank of a particular kind which, he seems to  
have imagined, might issue paper to the amount of the whole value of all the  
lands in the country, he proposed to remedy this want of money.—it was afterwards adopted, with some  
variations, by the  
Duke  
of Orleans at that time regent of  
France. the idea of the  
possibility of multiplying paper to almost any extent was the real foundation  
of what is called the  
Missisipi scheme, the  
most extravagant project, both of banking &amp; stock jobbing, that perhaps the  
world ever saw.—the principles upon which it was founded are explained by  
mr Law himself, in a discourse concerning Money  
&amp; trade, which he published in  
Scotland when he first proposed his project. the  
splendid but visionary ideas which are set forth in that and some other works  
upon the same principles, still continue to make an impression upon many  
people, and have perhaps in part contributed to that excess of banking which  
has of late been complained of both in  
Scotland and in other places.’ the  
Missisipi scheme, it is well known, ended  
in  
France in the bankruptcy of the public  
treasury, the crush of thousands and thousands of private fortunes, and scenes  
of desolation and distress equal to those of  
an invading army burning &amp; laying waste all  
before it.  
At the time we were  
funding our National debt we heard much about ‘a public debt being a public  
blessing’; that the stock representing it was a creation of active capital for  
the aliment of commerce, manufactures and agriculture. this paradox was well  
adapted to the minds of believers in dreams, and the gulls of that size entered  
bonâ fide into it. but the art &amp; mystery of banks is a wonderful  
improvement on that. it is established on the principle that ‘private debts are a public  
blessing.’ that the evidences of those private debts, called bank notes, become  
active capital and aliment the whole commerce, manufactures, &amp; agriculture  
of the  
US. here are a set of people for instance who have  
bestowed on us the great blessing of running in our debt about  
200.M. of D. without our knowing who they  
are, where they are, or what property they have to pay this debt when called  
on. nay, who have made us so sensible of the blessing of letting them run in  
our debt, that we have exempted them by law from the repaiment of these debts  
beyond a given proportion (generally estimated at one third.) and to fill up  
the measure of blessing, instead of paying, they recieve an interest on what  
they owe from those to whom they owe. for all the notes, or  
evidences of what they owe, which we see in circulation, have been lent to  
somebody on an interest which is levied again on us thro’ the medium of  
commerce. and they are so ready still to deal out their liberalities to us,  
that they are now willing to let themselves run in our debt  
90. Millions more, on our paying them the  
same premium of 6. or 8. p.c. interest, and on the same legal exemption from  
the repaiment of more than 30.M. of the debt  
when it shall be called for. but let us look at this principle in it’s original  
form, and it’s copy will then be equally understood. ‘a public debt is a public blessing.’  
that our debt was juggled  
from 43. up to  
80.M. and funded at that amount, according to  
this opinion, was a great public blessing, because the evidences of it could be  
vested in commerce, and thus converted into active capital, and then the more the debt was made to be, the more active  
capital was created. that is to say, the Creditors could now employ in commerce  
the money due them from the public, and make from it an annual profit of 5.  
p.c. or 4.M. of D. but observe that the  
public were at the same time paying on it an interest of exactly the same  
amount of 4.M. of D. where then is the gain  
to either party which makes it a public blessing? there is no change in the  
state of things, but of persons only. A. has a debt due to him from the public, of  
which he holds their certificate as evidence, and on which he is recieving an  
annual interest. he wishes however to have the money itself, and to go into  
business with it. B. has an  
equal sum of money in business, but wishes now to retire, and live on the  
interest. he therefore gives it to A in exchange for  
A’s certificates of public  
stock. now then A has the money  
to employ in business, which B  
so employed before. B has the  
money on interest to live on which A lived on before: and the public pays the  
interest to B which they paid  
to A before. here is no new  
creation of capital, no additional money employed, nor even a change in the  
employment of a single dollar. the only change is of place between  
A. and  
B. in which we discover no  
creation of capital, nor public blessing. suppose again the public to owe  
nothing. then A not having lent  
his money to the public, would be in possession of it himself, and would go  
into business without the previous operation of selling stock. here again the  
same quantity of capital is employed as in the former case, tho no public debt  
exists. in neither case is there any creation of active capital, nor other  
difference than that there is a public debt in the first case, and none in the  
last, and we may safely ask which of the two situations is most truly a public  
blessing. if then a public debt be no public blessing, we may  
pronounce, a fortiori, that a private one cannot be so. if the debt which the  
banking companies owe be a blessing to any body, it is to  
themselves alone who are realising a solid interest of 8. or 10. p.c. on it. as  
to the public, these companies have banished all our gold and silver medium  
which, before their institution, we had without interest, which never could  
have perished in our hands, and would have been our salvation now in the hour  
of war; instead of which they have given us 200.M. of froth and bubble, on which we are to pay them  
heavy interest, until it shall vanish into air, as  
Morris’s notes did. we are warranted then in  
affirming that this parody on the principle of ‘a public debt being a public  
blessing,’ and it’s mutation into the blessing of private instead of public  
debts, is as ridiculous as the original principle itself. in both cases the  
truth is that Capital may be produced by industry, and accumulated by economy;  
but juglers only will propose to create it by legerdemain tricks  
on with paper.  
I have called the actual circulation of  
bank paper in the  
US. 200. millions of  
Dollars. I do not recollect where I have seen this estimate; but I  
retain the impression that I thought it just at the time. it may be tested  
however by a list of the banks now in the  
US. and the amount of their capital. I have no  
means of recurring to such a list for the present day: but I turn to two lists  
in my possession for the years 1803. and 1804.  
  
  
  
D  
  
  
in 1803. there were 34. banks whose capital  
was  
28,902,000.  
  
  
in 1804. there were 66. consequently 32. additional ones.  
their capital is  
  
  
not stated, but at the average of the others  
(excluding the highest, that  
  
  
of the US. which was of 10.M.) they would be of 600,000.D  
D  
each and add  
19,200,000  
  
  
making a total of  
48,0102,000  
  
  
or say of 50.M. in round numbers. now every one knows the immense  
multiplication of these institutions since 1804. if they have only doubled,  
their capital will be of 100.M. and if  
trebled, as I think probable, it will be of 150.M. on which they are at liberty to  
tre circulate treble the  
amount. I should sooner therefore believe 200.M. to be far below than above the actual  
circulation.   
In  
England, by a late Parliamentary document, (see  
Virginia Argus of Oct. 18.  
13. &amp; other public papers of about that date) it appears that 6.  
years ago the bank of England had 12. millions of  
pounds sterling in circulation, which had increased to  
42.M. in 1812. or to 189 M. of D. what proportion all the other banks may  
add to this I do not know: if we were allowed to suppose they equal it, this  
would give a circulation of 378.M. or the  
double of ours on a double population. but that nation is essentially  
commercial; ours essentially agricultural, and needing therefore  
less circulating medium, because the produce of the husbandman comes but once a  
year, and is then partly consumed at home, partly exchanged by barter. the  
Dollar which was of 4/6  
sterl. was by the same document stated to  
be then 6/9 a depreciation of exactly 50. p.c.the average price of wheat  
on the continent of  
Europe, at the commencement of it’s present war  
with England, was about a  
French crown of 110. cents the  
bushel. with us it was 100. cents, and  
consequently we could send it there in competition with their own. that  
ordinary price has now doubled with us, and more than doubled in  
England; and altho’ a part of this augmentation  
may proceed from the war demand, yet from the extraordinary nominal rise in the  
prices of land and labour here, both of which have nearly doubled in that  
period, and are still rising with every new bank, it is evident that were a  
general peace to take place tomorrow, &amp; time allowed for the  
reestablishment of commerce, justice and order, we could not afford to raise  
wheat for much less than 2.D. while the  
continent of  
Europe, having no paper circulation, &amp; that of  
it’s specie not being augmented, would raise it at their former price of  
110. cents. it follows then that, with our  
redundancy of paper, we cannot, after peace, send a bushel of wheat to  
Europe unless extraordinary circumstances double  
it’s price in particular places, and that then the exporting countries of  
Europe could undersell us.   
			   
It is said our paper is as good as  
silver, because we may have silver for it at the bank from which it issues.  
this is not true. one two or three persons might have it: but a general  
application would soon exhaust their vaults, and leave a ruinous proportion of  
their paper in it’s intrinsic worthless form. it is a fallacious pretence for  
another reason. the inhabitants of the banking cities might obtain cash for  
their paper as far as the cash of the vaults would hold out: but distance puts  
it out of the power of the country to do this. a farmer having a note of a  
Boston or  
Charleston bank, distant  
hundreds of miles, has no means of calling for the cash. and while these calls  
are impracticable for the country, the banks have no fear of their being made  
from the towns; because their inhabitants are mostly on their books, &amp;  
there on sufferance only, and during good behavior.  
In this state of things we are called on  
to add 90.M. more to the circulation.  
proceeding in this career it is infallible that we must end where the  
revolutionary paper ended. 200.M. was the  
whole amount of all the emissions of the old  
Congress, at  
which point their bills ceased to circulate. we are now at that sum; but with  
treble the population, and of course a longer tether. our depreciation is, as  
yet, but at about 2. for 1. owing to the support it’s credit recieves from  
the small reservoirs of specie in the vaults of the banks. it is  
impossible to say at what point their notes will stop. nothing is necessary to  
effect it but a general alarm; and that may take place whenever the public  
shall begin to reflect on and percieve the impossibility that the banks should  
repay this sum. at present, caution is inspired no farther than to keep prudent  
men from selling property on long paiments. let us suppose the panic to arise  
at 300.M. a point to which every session of  
the legislatures hastens us by long strides. nobody dreams that they would have  
300.M. of specie to satisfy the holders of  
their notes. were they even to stop now, no one supposes they have  
200.M. in cash, nor even the  
66⅔ M. to  
which amount alone the law obliges them to repay.  
133⅓ M. of  
loss then is thrown on the public by law: and as to the 66⅔ which they are  
legally bound to pay, and ought to have in their vaults, every one knows there  
is no such amount of cash in the  
US. and what would be the course with what they  
really have there? their notes are refused. cash is called for. the inhabitants  
of the banking towns will get what is in the vaults, until a few banks declare  
their insolvency; when, the general crush becoming evident, the others will  
withdraw even the cash they have, declare their bankruptcy at once, and leave  
an empty house and empty coffers for the holders of their notes. in this  
scramble of creditors, the country gets nothing, the towns but a little. what  
are they to do? bring suits? a million of creditors bring a million of suits?  
against  
John Nokes and Robert Stiles wheresoever to be found? all nonsense. the  
loss is total. and a sum is thus swindled from our citizens of  
eight seven times the  
amount of the real debt and 4. times that of the factitious  
one of the  
US. at the close of the war. all this they will  
justly charge on their legislatures; but this will be poor satisfaction for the  
2. or 300.M. they will have lost. it is time  
then for the public functionaries to look to this. perhaps it may not be too  
late. perhaps, by giving time to the banks, they may call in and pay off their  
paper by degrees. but no remedy is ever to be expected while it rests with the  
state legislatures. personal motives can be excited thro’  
too so many avenues to their will that in their  
hands it will continue to go on from bad to worse, until the catastrophe  
overwhelms us.I still believe however that on proper representations of  
the subject a great proportion of these legislatures would cede to  
Congress their  
powers of establishing banks, saving the charter rights already granted. and  
this should be asked, not by way of amendment to the constitution, because  
until three fourths should consent nothing could be done; but accepted from  
them one by one singly as their consent might be obtained. any single state, even if no other should come into the measure, would find it’s  
interest in arresting foreign bank paper immediately, and it’s own by degrees.  
specie would flow in on them as paper disappeared. their own banks would call  
in and pay off their notes gradually, and their constituents would thus be  
saved from the general wreck. should the greater part of the states concede, as  
is expected, their power over banks to  
Congress,  
besides ensuring their own safety, the paper of the non-conceding states might  
be so checked and circumscribed by prohibiting it’s reciept in any of the  
conceding states, and even in the non-conceding as to duties, taxes, judgments  
or other demands of the  
US. or of the citizens of other states, that it  
would soon die of itself, and the medium of gold &amp; silver be universally  
restored. this is what ought to be done. but it will not be done.  
Carthago non  
deliebitur. the overbearing clamor of  
merchants, speculators and projectors, will drive us before them with our eyes  
open until, as in  
France, under the  
Missisipi bubble, our citizens will be overtaken  
by the crush of this  
baseless fabrick, without other  
satisfaction than that of execrations on the heads of those functionaries, who  
from ignorance, pusillanimity, or corruption have betrayed the fruits of their  
industry into the hands of projectors and swindlers.  
When I speak  
comparatively of the paper emissions of the old  
Congress &amp;  
of the present banks, let it not be imagined that I cover them under the same  
mantle. the object of the former was a holy one; for if ever there was a holy  
war, it was that which saved our liberties and gave us independance. the object  
of the latter is to enrich swindlers at the expence of the honest &amp;  
industrious part of the nation.  
The sum of  
what has been said is that, pretermitting the constitutional question on the  
authority of  
Congress, and  
considering this application on the grounds of reason alone, it would be best  
that our medium should be so proportioned to our produce as to be on a par with  
that of the countries with which we trade, and whose medium is in a sound  
state: that specie is the most perfect medium because it will preserve it’s own  
level, because, having intrinsic and universal value it can never die in our  
hands, and it is the surest resource of reliance in time of war: that the  
trifling economy of paper as a cheaper medium, or it’s convenience for  
transmission weigh nothing in opposition to the advantages of the precious  
metals; that it is liable to be abused, has been, is, and for ever will be  
abused in every country in which it is permitted: that it is already at a term  
of abuse in these states which has never been reached by any other nation,  
France excepted, whose dreadful catastrophe should  
be a warning against the instrument which produced it; that we  
are already at 10. or 20. times the due quantity of medium, insomuch that no  
man knows what his property is now worth, because it is bloating while he is  
calculating, and still less what it will be worth when the medium shall be  
relieved from it’s present dropsical state: and that it is a palpable falsehood  
to say we can have specie for our paper whenever demanded. instead then of  
yielding to the cries of a scarcity of medium set up by speculators, projectors  
and  commercial  
gamblers, no endeavors should be spared to begin the work of reducing it by  
such gradual means as may give time to private fortunes to preserve their  
poise, and settle down with the subsiding medium; and that for this purpose the  
states should be urged to concede to the general government, with a saving of  
chartered rights, the exclusive power of establishing banks of discount for  
paper.  
To the existence of banks  
of discount for  
cash, as on the continent  
of Europe, there can be no objection, because there  
can be no danger of abuse, and they are a convenience both to merchants and  
individuals. I think they should even be encouraged by allowing them a larger  
than legal interest on short discounts, and tapering thence, in proportion as  
the term of discount is lengthened, down to legal interest on those of a year  
or more. even banks of deposit, where cash should be lodged, and a  
paper-acknolegement taken out as it’s representative, entitled to a return of  
the cash on demand would be convenient for remittances, travelling persons  
Etc. but, liable as it’s  
cash would be to be pilfered &amp; robbed, and it’s paper to be fraudulently  
re-issued, or issued without deposit, it would require skilful &amp; strict  
regulation. this would differ from the bank of  
Amsterdam in the circumstance that the cash could  
be re-demanded on returning the note.

time to consider the constitutional question, and  
when the renewal was proposed [in 1811] they  
condemned it, not by their representatives in  
Congress only, but by express instrustions from  
different organs oftheir will.

It is a littered question, whether the cir­  
culation of p ipei, rather than of specie, is a  
good or an evil. In the opinion of England  
and of English wrifr it is a good; in that  
of all other nations it is an evil; nnd except  
England and her copyist, the United S&#x27;ates,

n d as answered. But. settini? authority  
apart, we will ex-unine whether the legisla­  
ture oujjht to comply with it, even if they  
had the power.  
Proceeding to reason on this subject, some  
principles must be premised as firming its  
basis. The adequate price of a thing depends !  
  
on the capital and labor necessary to pro-j,:,.r  
  
duce it. In the term capital. I mean to in  
dude science, because capital as well as la  
bor has been employed lo acquire it.&quot;) Two!  
things requiring the same capital and labor,  
should be ol the same price. II a gallon of  
wine require for its production the same  
capital and labor with a bushel of wheat.  
they shou&#x27;d be expressed by the same price.  
divided from the application to a common  
measure to them. 1 he comparative prices  
of things being thus to be estimated, and ex­  
pressed by a common measure, we may pro­  
ceed to observe, that were a country s in­  
sulated as lo h tve no commercial intercourse  
with any other, t confine the interchange  
of all its wants and supplies within itself,  
the amount of circulating medium, as a com­  
mon measure for adjusting these exchanges,  
would be quite immaterial. If their circula­  
tion, for instance, were of a million of dollars,  
and the annual produce of their industry  
equivalent to ten million of bushel of  
wheit, the price of a bushel of wheat might  
be one dollar. If, then, by a progressive  
coinage, their medium should be doubled, the  
price of a buhel of wheat might become  
progressively two dollars, and without incon  
venience. Whatever be the proportion of  
the circulating medium to the value of the  
-annual porduce of industry, it may be con-  
sidered as the representative of that indus­  
try. In the first case, a bushel of wheat will  
by represented by one dollar; in the ec-nd  
by two dollars. This is well explained by  
Hume, and ems admitted by Adam Smith,  
B. 2. c 4 438. 490. But where a nation  
is in a full course ol interchange of wants  
and. supplies with all others, the proportion  
i If  
i,,n ,r in. i  
&#x27;j:or..... Ik ail. To trrl nn enunl  
&#x27;terms, the common measure of value should  
be a nearly as possible on a par with that  
of it eorreioondini nations, whos medium  
uiwiriiu mv . - &quot; ........  
i in a ound stale; that is to say. not in tn  
acci lental state ol excesj or deficiency.  
Now, one of the great advantaces of specie  
as a medium is, that being of universal val­  
ue, it will Veep itself at a general level, flow­  
ntj out from where it is too high ito part  
&#x27;where it is lower. Whereas, if the medium  
b of local value only, as paper money, if  
&#x27;too little, indeed, gold and silver will flow in  
to lupplv the deficiency bot .if too much,  
  
it accumulates, banishes the gold and silves  
not locked up in vaults and hoards, and de­  
pieeiates itself; that is to say, its proportion  
to the annual produce of industry being rais­  
ed, more of it is required to represent any  
particular article of produce than in the  
other countries. This is agreed by Smith,  
(B. 2. c. 2. 437.) ihe principal advocate for  
a paper circulation; but advocating it on the  
sole condition that it be strictly regulated.  
He admits, neveatheless, that &#x27;the commerce  
and industry of acuntry. cannot be so se­  
cuie when suspended on t!:e Daedal inn wings  
of paper money, os on the solid ground ol  
gold nnd silver; nnd that in lime of war,  
the insecurity is greatly increased, and great  
confusion possible where the circulation i  
for ihe crarter part in paper. B. 2- c. 2.  
484. But in a country where loans are un­  
certain, and a specie circulation &quot;(hefionlv  
  
sure resource for them, the prerVrrerjceSjf  
.  
iniu circulation assumes a tar ainTCfit Qr  
gree of importance, as is explained Tn my  
former letters.  
The only advantage which Smith propo  
ses by solisituling paper in the room of gold  
and silver moner, li. 2. c. 2. 434. is Mo  
replace an expensive instrument with one  
much less costly, and sometimes equally con  
venient;&#x27; that is to say. page 437, , to allow  
the gold and silver to he sent abroad and con­  
verted into foreign goods,&#x27; and to substitute  
pap. r rs being a cheaper measure. Bui  
this makes no addition to the stock or capi-  
tMl oi tiie n iiion. I lie cin s-mt out was  
worth as njich. while in the country, as the  
goods imported and taking its plare. It is  
only, then, a c&#x27;-angeof form in part of the  
national capital, frotnlli.it of gold and silver  
to other goods. He ad nils, too. that while

in this way of barter a ceat portion of the  
annual produce of the United States is ex  
changed without the intermediation of cash.  
We mi&#x27;jht safely, then sta&#x27;e our medium at  
the minimum of one thirtieth. Butvthatis  
one thirtieth of ihe value of the annual pro­  
duce of the industry of the United States?  
Or what is the whole value of the annual  
produce of the United Stales? An able wri­  
ter and competent judge of the subject, in  
1799, on a cood grounds as probably could  
be taken, estimated it, on the then population  
of four nnd a half millions of inhabitants, to  
be thirty seven nnd a half millions sterling,  
or one hundred nnd sixty eight and three  
fourths millions of dollars. See Cooper&#x27;s  
Political Arithmetic, pnje 47. Accoiding  
to the same estimate for our present popu­  
lation it will be three hundred millions of  
dollars, one thirtieth of which, Smith&#x27;s min­  
imum, would be ten millions, and one fifth,  
his maximum, would be sixty millions for the  
quan&#x27;um of circulating medium of any na­  
tion, from the circumstance before mention  
ed, we should place ourselves in the middle  
term of the calculation, to wit, at thirty five  
millions. One fifth of this, at the le ist.Smith  
thinks should be retained in specie, which !  
would leave twentv-eght millions of specie  
to be exported in exchange for other com-  
modi ties; and if fifteen millions of that should ,  
be returned in productive goods, and not in  
articles of prodigality, that would be the  
amount of capital which this operation would

I it paper, with aM its train&quot; of evils, moral, po-

to enumerate.-&#x27;  
There is another tuthonty to which we;  
may apped for-the propee quantity pf circu-j  
lating medium lor the United States. The f  
old Congress, when we were estinated at ,  
about two millions of people, on a long and  
able discussion, June the 22nd, 1775. deci ,  
aed tne suncient Quantity to ue two millions  
of dollars, which sum they then emitted.  
Acording to this, it should be eight millions,  
now that we are eight millions of people.  
TliisdiTers little from Smith&#x27;s minimum often  
millions, and strengthens our respect for  
that estimate.  
There is, indeed, a convenience in paper;  
its easy transmission from one place to an­  
other. Put this may be mainly supplied by  
bills of exchange, so as to prevent any great  
displacement ol actual coin. Two places i  
trading to.&#x27;ether balance their dealings, lor  
the most part, by their mutual supplies, and  
the debtor individuals of either may, instead  
of cash, remit the bills of those who are  
creditors in the same dealings; or may ob  
tain them turoiigh some third place with  
which both have derling. The cases would  
be rare where such bills could not be obtain  
ed, either directly or circuitously, and too  
unitnrortant to the nation to overweich the  
train of evils flowing Irom paper circulation.  
r rom eight to thirty-hve millions then  
being our proper circulation, and two hun  
dred millions the actual one, the memorial  
proposes to issue ninety million more, be  
cause, it savs a jrreat scarcity of money is  
proved by the numerous applications for  
banks; to wit, ISew lork for eighteen mill  
ions, I&#x27;ennsyivania ten millions, ic. j he  
answer to this shall be quoted from Adam  
Smith, B. 2. c. 2. page 462; where speak  
ing of the complamts of the trailers against  
the Scotch bankers, whohad already pone too  
far in their issues of paper, he says those  
traders and other undertaker having pot so  
much assistance from banks, wished to get  
still more. The banks, thev seem to have  
thought, could extend their credits to what  
ever sums might be wanted, without incur-  
inir any other expense besides that of a few  
reams of paper. Thev complained of the  
contracted views and dastardly spirit of the  
director of those banks, which did not. they  
aid, extend their credits in proportion to  
the extension of the trade of the country;  
meaning, no doubt, by the extension of that  
trade, the extension of their own projects  
licyond what they could . enrry on, either  
tri thnr own apt tar, or with what they  
had credit to borrow of private peop e in  
the usual way of bond or mortcroge. The  
banks, they seem to have thousht, were in  
honor bound to supply the deficiency, and  
to provide them with all the capital which  
they wanted to trade wi:h.&#x27; And again,  
page 470: 4 when banker discovered that  
certain projectors were tradins, not with  
any capital of their own. but with that which  
they advanced them, they endeavored to  
withdraw gradually, making every day great­  
er and greater difficulties about dicountin-.&#x27;.  
These difficulties alarmed and enraged in  
the highest degree those projectors. Their  
own distress, of which this prudent and ne­  
cessary reserve of the banks was nodoubt the  
immediate occasion, they called the distress  
of the country; and this distress of the coun­  
try, they said was altogether owing to the  
ignorance, pusillanimity, and had conduct fo  
the banks, which had not given a sufficient­  
ly liheral aid to the spirited undertakings  
of those who exerted themselves in order  
to beautify, improve and enrich the  
country. It was the duty of banks,  
they seemed to think, to lend for as long a  
time, and to as great an extent, as they  
might wish to borrow. It is, probably, the  
good paper of the projectors which the me-  
monnl says, the banks being viable to dis  
count, goes into the hands of brokers, who  
(knowing the risk of this good prtper) dis­  
count it at a much higher rate than legal in­  
terest, to the preat distress of tha enterpris­

dreams, and the gull of that size entered bona) capital was $28,902,000. In 1804, there)  
  
nlf into it. But the art and mvstery of  
banks is a wonderful improvement on tha.  
It is established on the principle, that &#x27;private  
debts are a public blessing 1 hat the evi­  
dences of those private debts, called bank­  
notes, tiecome active capital, and aliment the  
whole commerce, manufactures, and agricul­  
ture of the United States. Here are a set  
of people, for instance, who have bestowed  
on us the great blessing of running in our  
debt about two hundred millions of dollars,  
wrhout our knowing who  
they ore, w here  
they are, or wr-ai property t.iev have to pav  
thev have to pav  
this debt when called on; nay, who have  
made us so sensible of the blessings of letting  
them run in our debt, that we have exempted  
them by law from the repayment of these  
debts beyond a given portion, (generally es­  
timated at one third ) And to fill up the  
measure of blessing, instead of paying, they  
receive an interest on what thev owe from  
those to whom thev owe; for all the notes.  
or evidences of what they owe, which we  
see in circulation, have been lent to somebo­  
dy on an interest which is levied iigain on us  
through the medium of commerce. And  
they are so ready still to deal out their libe­  
ralities to us, that they are now willing to let  
themselves run in our debt ninety millions  
more, on our paying them the same premium  
of six or eight per cent, interest, and on the  
same legal exemption from the repayment of  
more than thirty millions of the debt, when  
it shall be called for. But let uj look at this  
principle in its original form, and its ropy  
will then be equally understood. &#x27;A public  
debt is a public blessing.&#x27; That our debt was  
juggled from forty-three up to eighty millions,  
and funded at that amount, according to this  
opinion, was a great public blessing, because  
the evidences of it could be vested in com­  
merce, and thus converted into active capi­  
tal, and then the more the debt was made to  
be, the more active capital, was created.  
That is to say, the creditors could now em­  
ploy in commerce the money due them from  
the public, and make from it an annual profit  
of five per cent., or four millions of dollars.  
But observe, that the public were at the same  
lime paying on it an interest of exactly the  
same amount of four millions of dollars.  
Where then is the gain to either party, which  
makes it a public blessing? There is no  
change in the state of things, but of persons  
onlv. A has a dent due to him from the pub  
lic, of which he holds their certificate ns evi  
dence, ami on which he i receiving an annu  
al interest. He wishes, however, to haie  
the iiioney itself, and to go into business w ith  
it. B has nn equal sum of money in business,  
but wishes now to retire, and live on the in­  
terest. He therefore gives it to A. in ex  
change for A&#x27;s certificate of public stork.-  
iow, then. A has the money to employ in  
business, which B so employed before. B  
has the money on inteiest to live on, which  
A lived on before: and the public pays the  
interest to B, which they paid to A before.  
Here is no new creation of capital, no addi  
tional money employed, nor even a change in  
the employment of a single dollar. The on­  
ly change is of place between A and B, in  
w hich we discover no creation of capital, nor  
public blessing. Suppose, again, the public  
to owe nothing. Then A not having lent  
his money to the public, would be in posses­  
sion of it himself, and would go into busi  
ness without the previous operation of sell-  
jng stock. Here again, the same quantity of  
oapitnl is employed as in the former case  
though no public debt exists. In neither  
lic debt in the first case, and none in the Inst;  
and we may safely ask which of the two situ­  
ations is most truly a public blessing? If,  
then, a public debt be no public blessing, we  
may pronounce a fortiori, that a private one  
  
cannot be so. If the debt which the bask­  
ing companies owe be a blessing to any bo­  
ly, it is to themselves alone, who are reali­  
zing a solid interest of eight or ten per cent,  
on it. As to the public, these companies  
have banished all our gold and silver mediums  
which, before their institution, we had with  
out interest, which never could have perish  
ed in our hands, and would have been our  
salvation now in the hour of war; instead  
of which, they have given us two hundred  
millions of froth and bubble, on which we  
are to pay them heavy interest, until it shall  
vanish into air, as .Morris&#x27;s notes did. .We  
are warranted, then, in affirming that this  
parody on the principle of a public debt be­  
ing a public blessing and its mutation into  
the blessing of private instead of public debts,  
is as ridiculous as the original principle itself.  
In both cases, the tnith is, that capital mar  
  
be produced by industry, and accumulated  
by economy: but jugglers only will propose  
to create it by legerdemain tricks with paper  
l have calieri the actual circulation of bank  
paper in ihe United States, two hundred mil­  
lions of dollars. I do not recollect where I  
have seen this estimate; but I retain the im­  
pression that I thought it just at the time. - It  
nay be tested, however, by a list of the  
banks now in the United States, and the  
amount of their capital. I hae no means of  
recurring to such a list for the present day:  
but I turn to two lists in my possession for  
the years of 1 803 and 1804.  
. were sixty-six, consequently thirty-two  
additional ones. Their capita is not  
stated, but at the average of the  
others (excluding the highest, that  
of the United States, which was of  
ten millions) they would be of sir  
hundred dollars each, and add  
19,200,000  
Making a total of  
$48,102,000  
VOL. IV. 23  
or say, of fifty millions in round numbers.  
i Now ev  
ery one knows the immense multipli  
cation ol these institutions since 1804. If  
they have only doubled, their capital will be  
of one hundred millions, and if trebled, at I  
think probable, it will be of one hundred  
and filty millions, on which they are at liber­  
ty to circulate treble the amount. I should  
sooner, therefore, believe two hundred mill­  
ions to be far below than obove the actual  
circulation. In England, by a late parlia­  
menta&#x27;y document (see Virginia Argus of  
October the 1 8th, 18 1 3, and other puclic pa  
pcrs of about that date) it appears that six  
years ago, the bank of England had increas­  
ed to forty-two millions in 1812, or to one  
hunrrd&amp; eighty-nine millions ofdollars. What  
proportion all the other banks may add to this,  
I do not know : if we were allowed to sup­  
pose they equal it, this would give a circula­  
tion of three hundred and seventy-eight mill  
ions, or the double of ours on a double  
population. But that nation i essentially  
commercial, ours essentisly agricultural, and  
needing, therefore, less circulating medium,  
because the produce of the - husbandman  
comes but once a year, and is then partly  
consumed at home, partly exchanged by bar  
ter. The dollar which was four shillings  
and six pence sterling. wos.by the same doc­  
ument, stated to be then six and nine pence  
a depreciation of exactly fifty per cent.  
The average price of wheat on the con­  
tinent of Eurcpe, at Ihe commencement of  
its present war with England, was about a  
French crown, or one hundred and ten  
cents, the bushel. With us it was one hun­  
dred cents, aad consequently we could send  
it there in competition with their own.  
That ordinary price hn now doubled . with  
ns, nnd more than doubled in England; and  
although ft part of this augmentation, may  
proceed from the war demand, yet from the  
extraordinary nominal rise in the prices of  
land and laNr here, both of which havej &quot;  
nearly doubled in that period, nnd are still  
rising&quot; w ith every new bank, it is evident that­  
were a general pence to take plare totror&#x27;  
row, and time allowed for there-establishment  
of commerce, iustiee and order, we  
could not nfiiird to raise wheat for much leSa  
hmi two dollars, while the continent or  
Europe, having no paper circulation, and  
that of iuspecienot being nngmented, would  
raise it at their former price of one hundred  
and ten rents. It follows, then, that with  
our redundancy of paper, we cannot, after  
peace, send a bushel of wheat to Europe,  
unless extraordinary circumstances double  
its price in particular place, and that then  
the exporting countries of Lurope could un  
dersell us.  
It is said our paper i as good as silver, be  
cause we may have silver for it at the bank  
where it issues. This is not true. One  
two, or three persons might have iu bat a  
general application would soon exhaust their  
vaults, and leave a ruinous proportion ot  
their paper in its intrinsic worthless form.--  
It is a fallacious pretence for another reason.  
The inhabitants of the banking cities, might  
obtain cash for their pnper at far as the)  
cash of the vaults would hold oot; bat dis­  
tance puts it out of the power of the-eoqntry  
to do this. A farmer , having a . net .of  
Boston or Charleston bank, distant fctue j  
of miles, ha no mean of calling fef -.&#x27;

And wliile these calls are impracticable for  
  
the country, the banks have no fear of their  
being made from the towns; because their  
inhabitants are mostly on their books, and  
there on sufferance only and during good be  
haviour.  
In this state of tilings, we are called onto  
add ninety millions more to the circulation.  
Proceeding in this career, it is infallible.  
that we must end where the revolutionary  
paper ended. Two hundred millions was  
the whole amount of all tlie emission of the  
old Congtess, at which point their bills ceas  
ed to circulate. We are now at the sum;  
but with treble the population, and of course  
&#x27; a longer tether. Our depreciation is, as yet,  
Dm at aoout two tor one. irwing 10 tne  
support its credit receives from the small  
jreservoirs of specie in the vaults of the  
banks, it is impossible to say at what point  
their notes will stop. JNothmg is necessary  
to effect it but a general alarm; and that may  
take place whenever the public shall begin  
to reflect on, and perceive, the impossibility  
that the banks should repay this sum. At  
present, caution is inspired no father than to  
keep prudent men from selling property on  
long payments. Let us suppose the panic  
4r amen n( thran litinJ r-wl mil!ine 1 nmnt fn  
j aim fc uu i nuiiuii.il uhimuii u yvstit  
which every session ol the legislatures has­  
tens us by Cong strides. Nobody dreams  
that they would have three hundred millions  
&#x27; of specie to satisfy the holders of their notes.  
Were they even to slop now, on one suppo­  
ses they have two hundred millions in cash,  
or even the sixty-six and two-thirds millions,  
to which amount alone the law obliges them  
to repay. One hundred and thirty-three  
and one-third millions of loss, then, is thrown  
on the public by law; and as to the sixty -sis  
and two thirds, which they are legally bound  
to pay, and ought to have in their vaults.  
every one knows there is no such amount of  
cash in the United States, and what would  
be the course with what they really have  
there? Their notes are refused. Cash is  
called for. The inhabitants of the banking  
towns will get what is in the va;i!s. nvi! a  
few banks declared their insolvenrv; .i&#x27;..-r..  
the general crush becoming evident, tue oth­  
ers will withdraw even the cash they have,  
declare their bankruptcy at once, and have  
an empty house and empty coffers for the  
holders of their notes. In this scramble of  
creditors, the country gets nothing, the  
towns Dut miie. nat are tney to dor tiring  
suns: j million 01 creuuors unng a minion  
of suits against John Nokes and Robert  
Styles, wheresoever to be found! All non­  
sense. The loss is total. And a sum is thus  
. swiuuieu ii win our ciu.eus, ui seven nines  
the amount of the real debt, and four times  
thatof the factitious one of the United States,  
at the close of the war. All this they will  
justly charge on their legislatures; but this  
will be poor satisfaction for the two or three  
hundred millions they will have lost. It is  
time, then, for the public functionaries to  
look to this. Perhaps it may not be too late.  
J Perhaps, by giving time to the banks, they  
may call in and pay off their paper by degrees.  
But no renedy is ever to be expected while  
it rests with the State legislatures. Person­  
&#x27; nl motives can be excited through so many av­  
enues at their will, that, in their hands, it w ill  
continue to go on from bad to worse, until  
the catastrophe overwhelms us. I still be­  
lieve, however, that on proper representa­  
tions of the subject, a great proportion Oi  
these legislatures would cide to Congress  
their power of establishing banks, saving  
the chartered rights already granted. And  
this should be asked, not by way of amend  
ment to the constitution, because until three  
fourth should consent, nothing could be done;  
but accept from them one by one, singly, as  
&#x27; their consent might be obtained. Any sin  
gle state, even it no otner should come into  
the measure, would find its interest in arrest­  
ing foreign bank-paper immediately, and its  
&#x27;own by degrees. Specie would flow in on  
them as paper disappeared. Their own  
banks would call in and pay off their notes  
gradually, and their constituents would  
thus be saved from the general wreck. Should  
the greater part of the States concede, as is  
expected, their power over banks to congress,  
besides insuring their own safety, the paper  
of the non-conceding States might be so  
checked and circumscribed, by prohibiting  
its receipt in any of the conceding States,  
. and even in the non-conceding as to dunes,  
taxes, judgments, or other demands of the  
United States, or of the citizens of other  
.States, that it would soon die of itself, and  
the medium of gold and silver be universally  
restored. This is what ought to be done.  
But it will not be done. Carthago non de­  
lebilur,. The overbearing clamor of mer-  
.V n I a I-t J - . . ..Ml  
drive us before tlie.n with our eyes open, un­  
til, as in France, under the Mississippi bub­  
ble, our citizens will be overtaken by the  
crash of this baseless fabric, without other  
satisfaction than that of execrations on the  
beads of those funtionaries, who, from igno­  
rance, pusillanmily, or corruption, h ive It  
trnvprl the fruits of their irwimtrv into t)i  
bandg of projectors and swindlers.  
When I speak comparatively of the paper  
emissions of the old Congress and the pre­  
sent banks, let it not be imagined that I cov­  
er them under the same mantle. The object  
of the former was a holy one; for if ever there  
was a holy war, it wag that which saved our  
liberties and gave ns independece. The ob-  
jecv uj wo icuer, u to enncn iwiaiers at  
&quot;the expense of the honest and industrious  
part of the nation.  
-, The sum of what has been said is, that  
-&#x27;pretermitting the constitutional question on  
&#x27;the authority of Congress, and considering  
Ihjs application on the grounds of reason a-  
tane-it would be best that our medium should  
h to &quot;trronortibned to onr produce, as to be  
tt-:i fi .: -. 7;. .  
  
on a par with that of the countries with  
which we trade, and whose medium is in a  
sound state: that specie is the most perfect  
medium, because it will pieserve its own  
level; because, having intrinsic and universal  
value, it can never die in our hands, and it  
  
is the surest resource of reliance in time of  
war: that the trilling economy of paper, as a  
cheaper medium, or its convicnence for trans  
mission, weighs nothing in opposition to the  
advantages of the precious metal?: that it is  
liable to be abused, has been, is, and for ever  
will be abused, in every country in which it  
is permitted; that it is already at a term of  
abuse in these States, winch has never uccn  
reached by any other nation, France except­  
ed, whose dreadful catastrophe should be a  
warning against the instrument which pro­  
duced it: that we are already at ten or twen­  
ty times the Hue quality of medium; insomuch  
that no man knows what his property is now  
worth, because it is bloating while he is  
calculating; and still less what it will be  
worth when the medium shall be relieved  
from its present dropsical state: and that it is  
a palpable fasehood to say we can have specie  
for our paper whenever demanded. In­  
stead, then, of yielding to the cries of me­  
dium set up by speculators, projectors and  
commercial gamblers, no endeavors should  
be spared to begin the work of reducing it  
by such gradual means as may give time to  
private fortunes to preserve their poise, and  
settle down with the subsiding medium; and  
th.it, fortl.is purpose, -States should be urged  
to concede to the General Government, with  
a saving of chartered rights, the exclusive  
power of establishing banks of discount for  
paper.  
To the existence of bu.ks of discount for  
cash, as on the continent of Europe, there  
can be no objection, jbecause there can be  
no danger of abuse, and they are a conven-1  
ience both to merchants and inJividuiIs. I  
think they should even be encouraged, by al­  
lowing them a larger th.m legal interest on j  
short discount.&#x27;, and tapering thence, in pro

U. States Bank. Here is the extract,  
&quot;The sum of what has been said is, that preter  
mitting the Constitutional question on the authority  
of Congtess, and considering this application on  
the grounds of reason alone, it would be best  
that our mediim should be so proportioned to our  
produce, as to be on a par with that of the coun  
tries with which we trade, and whose medinm is  
in a sound state: that specie is the most perfect  
medium, because it will preserve its own level;  
  
because, having intrinsic and universal value, it  
can never die in our hands, and it is the surest  
resource of reliance in time of war; that the tri  
fling economy of paper, as a cheaper medium, of  
its convenience for transmission, weighs nothing  
in opposition to the advantages of the precious  
metals: that it is liable to be abused, has been,  
is, and for ever will be abused, in every country  
in which it is permitted; that it is already at a  
&quot;term of abuse in these States, which has never  
been reached by any other nation, France excep  
ted, whose dreadful catastrophe should be a warn­  
ing against the instrument which produced it that  
we are already at ten or twenty times the due  
quantity of medium; insomuch, that no man  
knows what his property is now worth, because  
it is bloating while he is calculating; and still  
less what it will be worth when the medium shall  
be relieved lrom its present dropsical state; and  
that it is a palp able falsehood to say we can have  
specie for our paper whenever demanded. In  
tead, then, of yielding to the cries of scarcity of  
medium set up by speculators, projectors, and  
commercial gamblers, no endeavors should be  
spared to begin the work of reducing it by such  
gradual means as may give time to private for  
tunes to preserve their poise, and settle down with  
the subsiding medium.&quot;  
Thus we find that this &quot;chimera&quot; this &quot;hum  
bug&quot; this &quot;ufopian&quot; measure of an exclusive me  
talic currency did not vegetiate in the brain of  
Mr. Beston, but in the sound heads and ho

Long strides. Nobody dreams that they would  
have three hundred millions of specie to satisfy the

silver money, replaces a very expensive instrument of commerce with one  
much less costly and sometimes equally convenient. Circulation comes  
to be carried on by a new wheel, which it costs less both to erect and  
maintain than the old one.”  
  
This celebrated economist is as unfortunate in his illustration as in his  
argument with respect to paper money. A paper wheel would not seem  
to be very efficacious or valuable in a powerful machine. On the appli-  
cation of power, it is quite certain the machine would stop or run to de-  
struction, and such, to my mind, is the effect of the paper substitute for  
money in the currency. It has thrown out of gear, repeatedly, all the

the emission of paper currency.  
THOMAS JEEFERSON.  
The opinions of Thomas Jefferson, the great ex­  
emplar of liberal and democratic opinions, upon  
the subject of finance, were more than once re-­  
corded in strong opposition to an irredeemable  
currency. The best succinct account of paper  
money in America, in the days of the Revolution,  
was written by Jefferson for the French &quot;Encyclo.­  
pedie Methodique,&quot; and is to be found in the ninth  
volume of his works. In 1813, the scheme for  
Congress to establish a national bank being under  
discussion, Jefferson thus wrote from Monticello  
to John W. Eppes:  
Excepting England and her copyist, the United  
States, there is not a nation existing, I believe,  
which tolerates a paper circulation. The experr­  
ment is going on, however, desperately in Eng-­  
land, pretty boldly with us, and at the end of the  
chapter we shall see which opinion  
experience approves, for I believe it  
to be one of those cases where mercan-­  
tile clamor will bear down reason until  
it is corrected by ruin. And it is for this  
petty addition to the capital of the nation, this  
minimum of $1 adied to 1339, or 1333, per  
cent, that we are to give up our gold and silver  
medium, its intrinsic solidity, its universal value  
and its saving powers in times of war, and to sube­  
stitute for it paper, with all its train of evils,  
moral, political and physical, which I will not pre­  
tend to enumerate.

of the aation, this minimum of $1 added to  
or 10224 per cent, that we are to give  
up our gold and silver medium, its intrinsic  
solidity, its universal value and its saving  
power in time of war, and to substitute for  
it paper, with all its train of evils, moral, po­  
litical and physical, which I will not pretend  
to enumerate. The overbearing clamor of  
merchants, speculators and projectors will  
drive us before them, with our eyes open, un­  
til, as in France, under the Mississippi bub  
ble, our citizens will be overtaken by the  
crush of this baseless fabric, without other  
satisfaction than that of execrations on the

From these paragraphs joined to others,  
and dissociated ones in the letter, the New  
Era frames its quotation. But it omiis to  
add that Jefferson insisted that this cur  
rency should have but a brief time to run  
before maturity and should be based on ade­  
quate taxes levied at tbe time. It also omits  
  
to say that in the second letter, the Novem­  
ber letter, he argues through twenty pages  
against a permanent paper curreucy. It may  
be well to give tbe conclusion of the lettcr  
which is m these words:  
“The earn of what has been said is that,

He insisted that the proposed currency  
should have but a brief time to run before  
maturity, and that it should be based on  
taxes levied at the time. In the second  
letter to Eppes, written in November of the  
same year, he argued through twenty pages  
against a permanent paper currency. At  
the conclusion of the letter he said;  
“The sum of what has been said is that, pre­

down with the subsiding medium; and that for  
this purpose, the States should be urged to  
concede to the General Government with a

&quot;It would be best that our medium should  
be so proportioned to our produce as to be  
on a par with that of the countries with  
which we trade and whose medium is in a  
sound state; that specie is the most perfect  
medium because it will preserve its own  
level, because haviug intrinsic and universal  
value It can never die in our hands and is  
the surest resource of reliance in time of  
war; that the Jtrifling economy of paper as  
a cheaper medium of its convent nee for

time it was a litigated question whether  
the circulation of bank paper was a good  
or an evil, but it ought to be no longer  
so. &quot;In the opinion of England and of  
English writers,&quot; he says, &quot;it is a good.  
In that of all other nations it is an evil;  
and excepting England and her copyist,  
the United States, there is not a nation  
existing, I believe, which tolerates a  
bank paper circulation. The experi­  
ment is going on, however, desperately  
in England, pretty boldly with ua, and  
in the end we shall see which opinion  
experience approves. For I believe it  
to be one of those cases where mercan­  
tile clamor (board of trade clamor in  
our day) will bear down reason till it is  
corrected by ruin. At the time  
we were funding our national debt, we  
heard much about &#x27; a public debt being  
a public blessing.&#x27; This paradox was  
well adapted to the believers m dreams,  
and the gulls of that stamp readily em­  
braced it But the art and mystery of  
banks is a wonderful improvement on  
that. It is established on the principle  
that &#x27; private debts are a public blessing.&#x27;  
That the evidence of those private debts,  
called bank notes, become active capital,  
feeding commerce, manufactures and ag­  
riculture. Here are a set of people, for  
instance, ho have bestowed onus the  
great blessing of running in our debt  
about $200,000,000, without our knowing  
who they are or what means they have  
to pay this debt when called on; nay,  
who have made us so sensible of the  
blessing of letting them run in our debt  
that we have exempted them by law  
from the payment of these debts be­  
yond a stated proposition (generally  
one-third). And to fill up the measure of  
blessing, instead of paying, they receive  
an interest on what they owe from those  
to whom they owe. For all their notes  
which are in circulation have been lent  
on interest, which is levied.again on the  
producer through the medium of com­  
merce. If the debts which the banking  
companies owe, be a blessing to anybody,  
it is to themselves alone, who are real­  
izing a solid interest of 8 or 10 per cent,  
on it As to the publio, they have given  
us 8200,000,000 of froth and bubble on  
which we must pay them heavy interest  
until it vanishes in thin air. This  
parody, therefore, on the principle of &#x27;a  
public debt being a publio blessing,&#x27; is  
as ridiculous as the original principle  
itself. It is said that the bills  
are as good ss coin, because the banks  
are required to redeem them in coin.  
This is not true. One, two or three per­  
sons might have it, but a general de­

Now, one of the great advantages of  
a specic medium is that being of univer.  
sal value it will keep itself at a general  
level, flowing out from where it is too  
high into parts where it is lower.  
Whereas if the medium be of local value  
only, as paper money, if too little indeed,  
gold and silver will flow in to supply the  
deficleney; but if too much, it acoumu  
lates, banishes the gold and silver not  
locked up in tha vaults and hoards, and  
lepreciates itself; that is to say, its pro

individuals being able to pay in five

more, on our paying them the same  
premium of six or eight per cent  
interest, and on the same legal exemp  
tion from the payment of more than  
thirty millions of the debt when it shall  
be call for.  
If the dobt which the banking com­

1S13, which wan addressed to John W. Eppes,  
Jefferson declares that the object of the paper  
emissions of the banks &quot;Is to enrich swindlers,  
  
at the expense of the honest and industrious  
part of the nation.  
&quot;It is a litigated question, whether the cir­  
culation of paper rather than of specie, is a  
good or an evil. In the opinion of England  
and of English writers It is a good; la that of  
all other nations it is an evil; and excepting  
England, and her copyist, the United States,  
there is not a nation existing, I believe, which  
tolerates a paper circulation. The experiment  
is going on, however, dosperatoly in England,  
pretty boldly with us, and at the end of the  
chapter, we shall see which opinion experi­  
ence approves; for I believe It to be one of  
those cases where mercantile clamor will boar  
down reason until It Is corrected by ruin.  
&quot;At the time we funded our national debt, we  
heard much about &#x27;a public debt being a pub­  
lic blessing,&#x27; that the stock representing It was  
a creation of active capital for the aliment of  
commerce, manufactures and agrl :ulture. Tlili  
paradox was well adapted to the minds of be  
Hevers in dreams, and the gulls of that size en­  
tered bona fide into It. But the art and mljory  
of banks Is a wonderful improvement on  
that. It Is established on the principle that  
prlvato dobts are a public blessing;&#x27; that the  
evidences of thoe private dobts, called bank  
notes, become active capital, and aliment for  
the commerce, manufactures and agriculture  
of the United States. Here are a set of people,  
for instaice, who havo bestowed on us the  
great blessing of running in our debt about 200  
millions of dollars, without our knowing who  
they are, where they are, and what property  
they have to pay this debt when called on;  
nay, who have made us so senslbh of the bles­  
sings of letting them run in our debt, that we  
have exempted them by law from the repay­  
ment of these debts beyond a given proportion  
(generally estimated at one third). And to  
fill up the measure of blessing, instead of pay­  
ing, they receive an interest on what they owe  
from those they owe, f )r all the notes or evi­  
dences of what they owe, which we see in cir­  
culation, have been lent to somebody on an  
lnte&#x27;est which is levied again on us through  
the medium of commerce.  
&quot;If the debt which the banking companies  
owe be a blessing to anybody, it is to them­  
selves alone, who are realizing a solid Interest  
of 8 or 10 per cent, on it. As to the public,  
these companies have banished all our gold  
and silver medium, which, before their instl­  
tlon, we had without interest, which never  
could have perished in our hands, and would  
have been our salvation now in the hour of  
war; instead of which they have given us 200  
millions of froth and .bubble on which we are  
to pay them heavy interest, until it shall van­  
ish into air.  
It is said that our paper is as good as sliver,  
because we may have silver for it at the bank  
where it issues. This is not true. One, two or  
three persons might have it; but a general ap  
  
plication would soon exhaust their vaults,  
  
and leave a ruinous proportion of their paper  
in its intrinsic worthless form.  
Thus we see what kind of democrats  
Cleveland and Carlisle are. And the  
doctrines of Andrew Jackson coincide  
with those of JefTerson.as we will show  
hereafter. An Old Democrat.

alist who, feeling sure that he can  
take care of thlmself, is willing to incite  
the mob against other people, and es­  
pecially against the government. No  
professed apostle of Jeffersonian Democ­  
racy ever misrepresented Jefferson&#x27;s  
views and principles more completely  
than Mr. Johpson did. On the money  
question he said: &quot;It is the proper func­  
tion of government to issue money  
(meaning paper money.) This Is sound  
sense and Jeffersonian doctrine.&quot; As a  
matter of fact, Jefferson was an un­  
swerving advocate of specie and an un­  
relenting enemy of paper money. In a  
letter written in 1813 he said:  
It is a litigated question whether the cir­  
culation of paper, rather than of specie, is a  
good or an evil. In the opinion of England  
and of English writers it is good; and. ex­  
cepting England and her copyist, the United  
States, there U not a nation existing. I be­  
lieve, which tolerates a paper circulation.  
The experiment is going on, however, des­  
perately in England, pretty boldly with us,  
and at the end of the chapter we shall see  
which cplnlon experience approves: For I  
beli(rye it to be one of those cases where mer­  
cantile clamor will bear down reason until  
it is corrected by ruin.  
In this letter he argued at length  
against paper currency, and concluded  
by declaring that &quot;the trifling economy  
of paper as a cheaper medium or its  
convenience for transmission weighs  
nothing in opposition to the advantages  
of the precious metals. It is liable to be  
abused, has been, is and forever will be  
abused in every country in which it is  
permitted.&quot; Yet Mr. Johnson quote

be taken back in foreign wines, silks, &amp;c.,

nothing; and so far the substitution pro-

est payment of our debts and sacred pres­  
ervation of the public faith&quot; has been a  
good deal misrepresented during the past  
few years by those who loudly proclaim that  
his mantle has fallen upon them. It Is well,  
Just now, to emphasize that point, because  
those who talk most confidently of being  
disciples of the third President are the ad-  
vocates of a theory of Independent coinage  
cf money which Is not In accord with his  
views. Several years after Jefferson retired  
from the presidency, Sept. 11. 1S13, he wrote  
a letter to John W. Eppes, which contained  
the following dictum:  
To trade on equal terms the common  
measure of values should be as nearly as  
possible on a par with that of its corre­  
sponding nations whose medium is in a  
sound state; that is to say, not In an acci­  
dental state of excess or deficiency. Now  
one of the great advantages of specie as a  
medium is that, being of universal value, it  
will keep itself at a general level, flowing

where it is lower.
