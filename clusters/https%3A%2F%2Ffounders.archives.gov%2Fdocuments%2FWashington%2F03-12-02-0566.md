The Commander in Chief with the highest satisfaction expresses his thanks to the officers and soldiers for the fortitude and patience with which they have sustained the fatigues of the Campaign—Altho’ in some instances we unfortunately failed, yet upon the whole Heaven hath smiled on our Arms and crowned them with signal success; and we may upon the best grounds conclude, that by a spirited continuance of the measures necessary for our defence we shall finally obtain the end of our Warfare—Independence—Liberty and Peace—These are blessings worth contending for at every hazard—But we hazard nothing. The power of America alone, duly exerted, would have nothing to dread from the force of Britain—Yet we stand not wholly upon our ground—France yields us every aid we ask, and there are reasons to believe the period is not very distant, when she will take a more active part, by declaring war against the British Crown. Every motive therefore, irresistably urges us—nay commands us, to a firm and manly perseverance in our opposition to our cruel oppressors—to slight difficulties—endure hardships, and contemn every danger—The General ardently wishes, it were now in his power, to conduct the troops into the best winter quarters—But where are these to be found? Should we retire to the interior parts of the State, we should find them crowded with virtuous citizens, who, sacrificing their all, have left Philadelphia and fled thither for protection. To their distresses humanity forbids us to add—This is not all, we should leave a vast extent of fertile country to be despoiled and ravaged by the enemy, from which they would draw vast supplies, and where many of our firm friends would be exposed to all the miseries of the most insulting and wanton depredation—A train of evils might be enumerated, but these will suffice—These considerations make it indispensibly necessary for the army to take such a position, as will enable it most effectually to prevent distress &amp; to give the most extensive security; and in that position we must make ourselves the best shelter in our power—With activity and diligence Huts may be erected that will be warm and dry—In these the troops will be compact, more secure against surprises than if in a divided state and at hand to protect the country. These cogent reasons have determined the General to take post in the neighbourhood of this camp; and influenced by them, he persuades himself, that the officers and soldiers, with one heart, and one mind, will resolve to surmount every difficulty, with a fortitude and patience, becoming their profession, and the sacred   
  
cause in which they are engaged: He himself will share in the hardship, and partake of every inconvenience.  
Tomorrow being the day set apart by the Honorable Congress for public Thanksgiving and Praise; and duty calling us devoutely to express our grateful acknowledgements to God for the manifold blessings he has granted us—The General directs that the army remain in it’s present quarters, and that the Chaplains perform divine service with their several Corps and brigades—And earnestly exhorts, all officers and soldiers, whose absence is not indispensibly necessary, to attend with reverence the solemnities of the day

Dee. I, .I  
The Commander in Chief, with the migtiest satralac  
expresses his thanks to the officers and soldiers  
for the fortiude and pationce with which they have  
sustained the tatigues of the campaign. Although we  
have in some instances unfortunately failed, yet, upon  
the whole, Heaven has smiled upon our arms and  
crowned them with signal success; and we may, upon  
the beat ground, conciuue that ty a spartied coutin a  
of the measures necessary for our aclence wo  
shall anally obtain the and of ouf weltars inuepenge  
liberty and peace. These are blessings worth  
contending for at any hazard; but we hazard  
nothing. The power of Amórica alone, duly  
exercised, would have nothing to uread from  
the force of Britain. Yet we stand not  
wholly upon our own ground. France yields us every  
aid wo ask, and there are reasons to betieve the period  
is not far distant when she will take a more active  
part by declaring war against the British crown.  
Esery inotive, there fore itsesistlidy arges, way come  
us to a manly perseverance in our opposition  
  
to our civil oppressors, to slight difficulties, to endure  
hardships and contemn evory uanger. The General  
ardently wishes it was in his power to conduct the  
troops into the best winter quarters, but where are  
they to be tound? Should we retire to the exterior  
part of the State we should find them crowded with  
virtuous citizons, who, sacrifcing their all, have left  
Philadeiphia and fle thither for protection. To their  
distress humanity forbids us to add!  
This is not all. We should leave a vast extent of  
fertite country to beo despolled and ravaged by the  
enemy, from which they would draw vast supphtes  
and where many of our firm friends would be exposed  
to all the miseries of the most insulting and wanton  
depredations. A train of evis might be enumerats  
but these may suffice. These considerations make it  
indispensably necessary for the army to take such a  
nosition as will cuable it most effectually to provent  
distress and to give the most extensive security, and  
in this position we must make ourselves the best  
shelter in our power. With activity and dill  
genco huts may be erected that will be warm  
and dry. In these the troops will be more toe  
cure against surprise than in a divided state, and at  
hand to protect the country. The cogent roasons  
have determined the General to take post in the  
neighborhood of the camp, and, influenced by them,  
he persuades himself that the off  
  
with one heart and one mind will resoive every am  
culty with a fortitude and patience becoming their  
profession and the sacred catise in which they are ea
