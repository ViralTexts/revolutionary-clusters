cal Subjects. To tell you that the order of his Britannic Majesty in Council of the 8th of June last, respecting Neutral vessels had given much discontent to the United States—and, that that of the 6th of November, &amp; its results, had thrown them into a flame, will hardly be News to you when you shall have received this letter. The subsequent order of the 8th of Januy has, in a degree, allayed the violence of the heat; but will by no means satisfy them without reparation for the Spoliations of our Trade—&amp; the injuries we sustain from the non-performance of the Treaty of Peace.  
To effect these, if possible by temperate means, by fair, &amp; firm negotiation, an Envoy extraordinary is appointed, and will, I expect, Sail in a few days. Mr Jay is chosen for this mission. Mr John Trumbell goes as his private Secretary

ent Military establishment. To raise an Army of 25,000 men in addition thereto. and to Organise—put  
  
in training—and to hold in readiness at a minute’s warning, a select Corps of 80,000 Militia. Of the passing of the first &amp; last of these, no doubt seems to be entertained on either side of the House; but those who are fearful of what they call a standing Army, will give all the opposition they can to the other. The result therefore none will predict in the present stage of the business.  
Besides these, a Bill passed the House of Representatives by a large Majority, founded on the following preamble, &amp; resolution. &quot;Whereas, the injuries which have been suffered, and may be suffered by the United States, from violations committed by Great Britain, on their neutral rights &amp; commercial interests, as well as from her failure to execute the seventh article of the treaty of peace, render it expedient for the interests of the United States, that the commercial intercourse between the two Countries should not continue to be carried on in the extent at present allowed:  
&quot;Resolved, That from and after the first day of November next, all commercial intercourse between the Citizens of the United States, and the subjects of the King of Great Britain, or the citizens or subjects of any other nation, so far as the same respects articles of the growth or manufacture of G: Britain or Ireland, shall be prohibited.&quot;

he matter in the course of your perigrinations through England, Scotland or elsewhere, and you see no impropriety from circumstances, or your view of the subject at the moment, I should be glad if you were to do it. My wish further is, to dispose of the lands I have had restored to me by Mr De Barth; and in short my settled lands in the Western parts of this State, in the Counties of Fayette &amp; Washington. I have raised the price of my lands on the Ohio &amp; great Kanhawa to twenty shillings Virga currency pr Acre; the tract in Fayette (about 1700 Acres) to forty, and that in Washington to thirty shillgs pr Acre, Pennsylvania Curry—3,000 Acres.  
I have no scruple to disclose to you, that my motives to these sales (as hath been, in part, expressed to Mr Young) are to reduce my income, be it more or less, to specialties; that the remainder of my days may, thereby, be more tranquil &amp; freer from cares; and that I may be enabled (knowing precisely what my dependence is) to do as much good with it as the resource will admit—for although, in the estimation of the world I possess a good, &amp; clear estate; yet, so unproductive is it, that I am oftentimes ashamed to refuse aids which I cannot afford, unless I was to sell part of it, to answer the purpose.  
You are so well acquainted with the situation, and quality of the lands which are herementioned, for Sale, that it is almost unnecessary to go more into detail respecting them, with you. Those however on the Ohio, between the mouths of the little and Great Kanhawa, are in three tracts—the first containing 2314 Acres, laying on the Banks of the River, abt 12 Miles below Mariatte—the 2d 2448. Acres, still lower down (being the 4th large bottom on the East side of the River)—and the 3d, on the same side, opposite to the Great Bend in the River, containing 4395 Acres; all of which are of the first quality.  The Lands on the Great Kanhawa are in no respect inferior. They are contained in four Patents; the first, beginning within two miles of  
  
the mouth of that river, &amp; contains 10,990 Acres of the richest bottom; stretching 17 or 18 Miles along the river. The next of 7276 Acres is a little above the last, on the opposite side of the River; and the other two are still higher up, at the Mouth of, &amp; on Coal River; both are of the first quality; containing together about 5,000 Acres.  
Although it is my wish to convert these lands into Cash on the terms, and for the purposes mentioned—yet, for reasons which will readily occur to you, I would not hawk them about as some do; if they were never to be sold.  
I wish most sincerely that some inducement co

States, and that that of the 6th of November and its result  
had thrown them into a flame, will hardly be news to you  
when you shall receive this letter. The subsequent order  
of the 8th of January has in a degree allayed the violence  
of the heat, but will by no means satisfy them without  
reparation for the spoliations on our trade, and the injuries  
we sustain from the non-performance of the treaty of peace.  
To effect these if possible by temperate means, by fair and  
firm negotiations, an envoy extraordinary is appointed, and  
will, I expect, sail in a few days. Mr. Jay is chosen for the
