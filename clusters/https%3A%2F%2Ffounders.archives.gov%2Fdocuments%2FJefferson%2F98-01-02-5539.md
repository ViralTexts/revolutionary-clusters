Dear Sir

It is not for me to estimate the importance of the circumstances concerning which your letter of the 8th makes enquiry. they prove even in their minuteness the sacred attachment of our f.c. to the event of which the paper of July 4. 76. was but the Declaration, the genuine effusion of the soul of our country at that time. small things may perhaps, like the relicts of Saints helps to nourish our devotion to this holy bon of our union, and keep it  longer alive and warm in our affections, this effect may give importance to circumstances however small.at the time of writing that instrument I lodged in the house of a mr Graaf, a new brick house 3. stories high of which I rented the 2d floor consisting of a parlour and bed room ready furnished. in that parlour I wrote habitually and in it wrote this paper particularly, so far I state from written proofs in my profession. the following addns are specifns from a memory too much decayed to be relied on with much confidence. the proprietor Graaf was a young man, son of a German &amp; then newly married. I think he was a bricklayer, and that his house was on the S. side of Market street, probably between 7th &amp; 8th or perhaps higher and if not then the only house on that part of the street, I am sure there were few others yet built near it. if there be extant a Directory of that year it will probably lead to a recognition of the identical house, for the name of the owner may be relied on while I may misremember the particular location. I have some idea, but very faint that it was a corner house, but no other recollection throwing any light on the question, or worth communication and therefore will only add the assurance of my great esteem &amp; respect.Th: J.P.S. further reflection leads me to think more strongly that it might be the S.E. corner

The real birthplace of the Delara­  
tion of Independence was not the hall  
in which the Continental Congress  
met, but the room in which Jefferson  
wrote that document. That room was  
in a house at the southwest corner of  
Seventh and Market streets, Philadel­  
phia, which has stood till this day,  
but is now being demolished to give  
place to a plebeian bank. Jefferson  
wrote from Monticello to a Philadel­  
phia acquaintance in 1825:  
At the time of writing that instru­  
ment, I lodged in the house of a Mr.  
Graff, a new brick-house, three stories  
high, of which I rented the second  
floor, consisting of a parlor and a bed­

1825: “At the time of writing that instru­  
ment, I lodged In the house of a Mr. Graff, a  
new brick house, three stories high, of  
which I rented the second floor, consisting  
of a parlor and a bed room, ready furnished.  
In that parlor I wrote habitually, and in it I  
wrote this paper, particularly. So far I

There is thus no doubt of the place. While  
the millionaires of the East are contributing  
thousands of dollars for the erection of a  
modern monument to French vainglory and  
American pride in New York harbor, one  
would think they might give of their abun­  
dance a sufficient sum to preserve this an­  
cient and sacred landmark.  
Dabwin, the naturalist, once wrote of  
shallow critics of foreign missions: “They  
forget, or will not remember, that human  
sacrifices and the power of an idolatrous  
priesthood; a system of profligacy unparal­  
leled in any other part of the world; infanti­

An Ancient Landmark.  
  
The Penn National Bank of Philadel­  
phia a year ago bought for $80,000 the  
two old stores at the southwest corner of  
Seventh and Market streets, and work­  
men are now tearing them down to make  
room for a modern structure. In one of  
these ancient buildings, probably in the  
one not directly on the corner, Jefferson  
drafted the Declaration of Independence.  
In a letter to Dr. James Pease he wrote  
as follows fromMonticello on September  
16, 1825 At the time of writing that  
instrument I lodged in the house of Mr.  
Graff, a new brick house, three stories  
high, of whioh I rented the second floor,  
consisting of a parlor and a bedroom,  
ready furnished. In that parlor I wrote  
habitually, and in it I wrote this paper,  
particularly. So far I state from written  
proofs in my possession. The proprie­  
tor, Graff, was a young man, son of a  
German, and then newly married. I  
think he was a bricklayer, and that his  
house was on the south side of Market  
street, probably between Seventh and  
Eighth streets, and, if not the only house  
on that part of the street, I am sure  
therewere very few others near iL I have  
some idea that it was a comer house, but
