ween five and six weeks—In the Missouri from six to eight weeks—In the upper Missisippi from eight to ten weeks; and in the lower Missisippi, between four and five months, that is, from January to July. As the Cherokee river rises in a mountainous, or hilly country, the water from the melting of the snow in the spring, with which those hills are covered in winter, no doubt, occasion an annual flood, but of what height or continuance, I cannot with certainty determine, but am of opinion, from about three to four weeks. I am entirely unacquainted with the Tanissee more than knowing it to be a branch of the Cherokee—In the spring floods the Missisippi, is very high, and the current so strong, that with difficulty it can be ascended; but that disadvantage is compensated by eddies or counter-currents, which always run in the bends, close to the banks of the river, with nearly equal velocity against the stream, and assist the ascending boats. The current at this season descends at the rate of about five miles an hour. In Autumn, when the waters are low it runs about two miles an hour, but it is rapid in such parts of the river, which have clusters of Islands, shoals and sand-banks. The circumference of many of these shoals being several Miles, the voyage is longer and in some parts more dangerous than in the spring. The Merchandize necessary for the commerce of the upper settlements, on or near the Missisippi, is conveyed in the spring and autumn, in battoes, rowed  by 18 or 20 men, and carrying about 40 tons. From New Orleans to the Illinois a distance of 950 miles the voyage is commonly performed in eight or ten weeks. I wish I was able to furnish you with a more satisfactory account, but at present it is out of my power.

go. Those who have made  
this subject a study think they can locate  
the rock and island alluded to in the original  
sketch as the same which are now found  
below the falls, stranded, as it were, since  
the recession of the falls of a century ago,  
by the constant and inexorable action of  
the water in undermining and destroying  
the ledge, which process science and the  
most skillful engineering have arrested in  
later years.  
  
In speaking of the lakes and rivers of  
North America, Winterbottom makes the fol-  
lowing allusion to the commerce of the Mis-  
sissippi River at that early day: “The mer-  
chandise necessary for the commerce of the  
upper settlements on or neay the Mississippi  
River is conveyed in the spring and autumn  
  
in batteaux, rowed by eighteen or twenty |  
From |  
  
men, and carrying about forty tons.  
New Orleans to the Illinois the voyage is  
commonly performed in eight or ten weeks.”
