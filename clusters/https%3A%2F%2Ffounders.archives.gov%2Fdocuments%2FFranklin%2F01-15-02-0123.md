r Madam,  
London, Craven-street, Sept. 28, 1768.  
The objection you make to rectifying our alphabet, “that it will be attended with inconveniences and difficulties,”  is a natural one; for it always occurs when any reformation is proposed, whether in religion, government, laws, and even down as low as roads and wheel carriages. The true question then, is not whether there will be no difficulties or inconveniences; but whether the difficulties may not be surmounted; and whether the conveniences will not, on the whole, be greater than the inconveniences. In this case, the difficulties are only in the beginning of the practice; when they are once overcome, the advantages are lasting. To either you or me, who spell well in the present mode, I imagine the difficulty of changing that mode for the new is not so great, but that we might perfectly get over it in a week’s writing.  
As to those who do not spell well, if the two difficulties are compared, [viz.] that of teaching them true spelling in the present mode, and that of teaching them the new alphabet and the new spelling according to it; I am confident that the latter would be by far the least. They naturally fall into the new method already, as much as the imperfection of their alphabet will admit of; Their present bad spelling is only bad, because contrary to the present bad rules; under the new rules it would be good. The difficulty of learning to spell well in the old way is so great, that few attain it; thousands and thousands writing on to old age, without ever being able to acquire it. ’Tis, besides, a difficulty continually increasing; as the sound gradually varies more and more from the spelling: and to foreigners it makes the learning to pronounce our language, as written in our books, almost impossible.  
Now as to “the inconveniences” you mention-the first is; “that all our etymologies would be lost, consequently we could not ascertain the meaning of many words.” Etymologies are at present very uncertain; but such as they are, the old books would still preserve them, and etymologists would there find them. Words in the course of time, change their meanings, as well as their spelling and pronunciation; and we do not look to etymology for their present meanings. If I should call a man a Knave and a Villain, he would hardly be satisfied with my telling him, that one of the words originally signified only a lad or servant; and the other, an under plowman, or the inhabitant of a village. It is from present usage only, that the meaning of words is to be determined.  
Your second inconvenience is, that “the distinction between words of different meaning and similar sound would be destroyed.” That distinction is already destroyed in pronouncing them; and you rely on the sense alone of the sentence to ascertain, which of the several words, similar in sound, we intend. If this is sufficient in the rapidity of discourse, it will be much more so in written sentences; which may be read leisurely; and attended to more particularly in case of difficulty, than you can attend to a past sentence, while a speaker is hurrying us along with new ones.  
  
Your third inconvenience is, that “all the books already written would be useless.” This inconvenience would only come on gradually, in a course of ages. You, and I, and other now living readers, would hardly forget the use of them. People would long learn to read the old writing, though they practised the new. And the inconvenience is not greater, than what has actually happened in a similar case, in Italy. Formerly its inhabitants all spoke and wrote Latin; as the language changed, the spelling follow’d it. It is true that at present, a mere unlearn’d Italian cannot read the Latin books; though they are still read and understood by many. But, if the spelling had never been changed, he would now have found it much more difficult to read and write his own language,  for written words would have had no relation to sounds, they would only have stood for things; so that if he would express in writing the idea he has, when he sounds the word Vescovo, he must use the letters Episcopus. In short, whatever the difficulties and inconveniences now are, they will be more easily surmounted now, than hereafter; and some time or other it must be done; or our writing will become the same with the Chinese, as to the difficulty of learning and using it. And it would already have been such, if we had continued the Saxon spelling and writing, used by our forefathers. I am, my dear friend, yours affectionately,  
B. Frankli

true queftion then is not, whether  
there will be no difficulties or incon-  
veniences ; but whether the difficul-  
ties may not be furmounted ; and  
whether the conveniences will not‘on  
the whole, be greater than the incon-  
  
veniences. In this cafe, the difficul-  
  
ties are only in the beginning of the  
  
practice ; when they are once over-  
  
come, the advantages are lafting. To  
  
either you or me, who fpell well in  
  
the prefeat mode, I imagun the diffi-  
  
culty of changing that mode for the  
  
new, is not fo great, but that we might  
  
perfectly get over it ina week’s writ-  
  
ing. As to thofe who do not fpell  
  
well, if the two difficulties are com-  
  
pared, viz. that of teaching them true  
  
—&lt; in the prefent mode, and that  
  
of teaching them the new alphabet and  
  
the new {pelling according to it, I am  
  
confident that the latter would be by  
  
far the leaft. ‘They naturally. fall in-  
  
to the new method already, as much  
as the imperfection of their alphabet  
will admit of; their prefent dad fpell-  
  
ing is only bad, becaufe contrary to  
the prefent dad rules ; under the new  
  
rules it would be good.* The diffi-  
  
culty of learning to {pell well in the  
oki way is fo great, that few attain  
it; thoufands and thoufands writing  
on to old age, without ever being able  
to acquire it. It is befides a ditficul-  
ty continually encreafing ;f as the  
found gradually variesmore and more  
from the fpelling ; and to foreigners  
it makes the learning to pronounce  
our language, as written in our books,  
almoft impoflible.  
  
Now as to the inconveniences you  
mention : The firft is, “ that ail our  
etymologies would be loft ; confe-  
quently we could not afcertain the  
meaning of many words.”” Etymolo-  
gies are at prefent very uncertain; but  
fuch as they are, the old books ftill  
preferve them, and etymologifts would  
there find them. “Words in the courfe  
of time, change their meaning, as well  
as their fpelling and~promunciation ;  
  
and we do not lock to etymologies for  
the prefent meanings. If I thould  
calla man a dnave anda villain, he  
would hardly be fatisfied with my tell-  
ing him, that one of the words orig-  
inally fignified a ad or fervant, and the  
other an under plowman, or the in-  
  
habitant of a village. 1tis from pref-  
ent ufuage only, the meaning of words  
is to be determined. .  
  
Your fecond inconvenience is, ‘‘ the  
diftinction between words of different  
meaning and fimilar found would be  
deftroyed.’” That diftinction is al-  
ready deftroyed in pronouncing them ;  
and we rely on the fenfe alone of the  
fentence to afcertain which of the fev-  
eral words, fimilar in found, we in-  
tend. If this is fufficient in the rap-  
idity of difcourfe, it will be much  
more fo m written fentences, which  
may be read leiferely, and attended  
to more particularly in cafe of difficul-  
ty, than we can attend to a paft fen-  
tence, while the fpeaker is hurrying  
us along with new ones:  
  
Your third inconvenience is, “* that  
all the books already written would  
be ufelefs.’” ‘This inconvenience  
would only come on gradually in a  
eourfe of ages. I and you and other  
now living readers would hardly for-  
  
ret the mA of them. People would  
nae learn to read the old writing,  
tho they practice the new. And the  
inconvenience is not greater than what  
has actually happenedin a fimilar cafe  
in Italy. Formerly its inhabitants all  
fpoke and wrote Latin; as. the lan-  
guage changed, the fpelling followed  
it. Itis true that at prefent, a mere  
unlearned Ltalian cannot read the Lat-  
in books, tho they are ftill read and  
underftood by many. But ifthe fpell-  
ing had never been changed, he would  
now have found it much more diffi-  
cult to read and write his own lan-  
e ;t for written words would  
  
ave had no relation to founds ; they  
would only have ftood for things ; fo

‘Your second inconvenience is, ** that the distinction between words of dif-  
ferent meaning and similar sound would be destroyed.” That distinction is  
already destroyed in pronouncing them; and you rely on the sense alone of the  
sentence to ascertain which of the several words, similar in sound, we intend.  
If this is sufficient in the rapidity of discourse, it will be much more so in  
written sentences, which may be read leisurely, and attended to more par-  
ticularly in case of difficulty, than you can attend to a past sentence, while  
a speaker is hurrying you along with new ones.  
  
‘ Your third inconvenience is, that “all the books already written would  
be useless.” This inconvenience would only come on gradually, in a course  
of ages. You, and I, and other now living readers, would hardly forget the  
use of them. People would long learn to read the old writing, though  
they practised the new. And the inconvenience is not greater, than what  
has actually happened in a similar case in Italy. Formerly, its inhabitants  
all spoke and wrote Latin; as the language changed, the spelling followed  
it. Itis true, that, at present, a mere unlearned Italian cannot read the  
Latin books, though they are still read and understood by many. But, if the  
spelling had never been changed, he would now have found it much more  
difficult to read and write his own language, for written words would have  
had no relation to sounds, they would only have stood for things; so that, if  
he would express in writing the idea he has, when he sounds the word  
Vescovo, he must use the letters Episcopus. In short, whatever the dif-  
ficulties and inconyeniences now are, they will be more easily surmounted  
now, than hereafter ; and some time or other it must be done, or our writin  
will become the same with the Chinese, as to the difficulty of learning &lt;a  
using it. And it would already have been such, if we had continued the  
Saxon spelling and writing, used by our forefathers.’

er the conveniences will not. on the whole, be  
reater than the inconveniences: in this case,  
the difficulties are only in the beginning of the  
practice ; when they are once overcome the  
advi antages are lasting. ‘To either you or me,  
who spe ll well in the present mode, L imagine  
the difficulty of changing that mode for tl  
new, is not so great but that we might perfect-  
ly get over it in a few weeks writi As to  
those who do not spell weil, if the two diflicul-  
ties are compared, viz. that of teaching them  
true spelling in the present mode and that of  
  
teaching them the new alphabet, and the new  
spelling according to it, l am confident the latter  
would be by far the least. They naturally  
into the newmethod already, as much as the im-  
perfection of th ‘ir alphi ibet will admit of; their  
present bad spelling isonly bad, because contra-  
ry to the present bad rules; under the new rules  
it would be good. The difficulty of learning to  
spell well in the old way is so great, that few  
attain it, thousands and thousands writing on  
to old age, without ever being able to attain it.  
  
Tis besides a difficulty ¢ ontinually increasing  
as the sound gradually varies more and more  
from the spelling ; and to foreigners it makes  
‘the learning to pronounce our language as  
written in our books almost impossib le. Now  
as tothe inconveniences you mention. ‘The  
first is that all our ety mologies would be lost,  
consequently we could not ascertain the mean-  
ing of many words. Etymologies are at pre-  
sent very uncertain but such as they are. ‘lhe  
old books would still preserve them and ety-  
mologists would there find them. Words in  
ithe course of time change their meanings, as  
well as their spelling and pronunciation, and

will admit of ; their present bad spelling is only bad because con-  
trary to the present bad rules ; under the new rules, it would be  
good. The difficulty of learning to spell well in the old way is  
so great that few attain it, thousands and thousands writing on  
to old, old age without ever being able to acquire it. ’Tis be-  
sides a difficulty continually increasing, as the sound gradually  
varies more and more from the spelling; and to foreigners it  
makes the learning to pronounce our language, as written in our  
books, almost impossible. Now as to the ‘inconveniences’ you  
mention. The first is that ‘all our etymologies would be lost,  
consequently we could not ascertain the meaning of many words.’  
  
‘“‘Etymologies are at present very uncertain ; but such as they  
  
are, the old books would still preserve them, and etymologists  
would there find them. Words, in the course of time, change  
  
their meaning as well as their spelling and pronunciation ; and  
we do not look to etymology for their present meanings. If I  
should call a man aknave and a villain, he would hardly be sat-  
isfied with my telling him that one of the words originally sig-  
nified only a lad, or servant; and the other an under-plough-  
man, or inhabitant of a véllage. It is from present usage only,  
that the meaning of words is to be determined.  
  
‘¢ Your second inconvenince is, that ‘ the distinction between  
words of different meaning, and similar sound, would be des-  
troyed.’? That distinction is already destroyed in pronouncing  
them ; and we rely on the sense alone of the sentence, to ascer-  
tain which of the several words, similar in sound, we intend.  
If this is sufficient, in the rapidity of discourse, it will be much  
more so in written sentences, which may be read leisurely, and  
attended to more particularly in case of difficulty ; then we can  
attend to a past sentence, while the speaker is hurrying us along  
with new ones. Your third inconvenience is, that ‘all the books  
already written, would be useless.” This inconvenience would  
only come on gradually in a course of ages. You and I, and  
other now living readers, would hardly forget the use of them.  
People would long learn to read the old writing, though they  
practiced the new, and the inconvenience is not greater than  
what has already happened in asimilar case in Italy. Formerly,  
its inhabitants all spoke and wrote Latin; as the language  
changed, the spelling followed it. It is true, that at present, a  
mere unlearned Italian cannot read Latin books, though they

are still read and understood by many. But if the spelling had  
never changed, he would now have found it much more difficult  
to read and write his own language; for written words would  
have had no relation to sounds ; they would only have stood for  
things, so that if he would express in writing the idea he has  
when he sounds the word ‘ vessovo,’ he must use the letters  
episcapus.  
  
‘In short, whatever the difficulties now are, they will be the  
more easily surmounted now, than hereafter, and some time or  
other, z¢ must be done, or our writing will become the same wit)  
the Chinese, as to the difficulty of learning and using it. And  
it would already have been such, if we had continued the Saxon  
spelling and writing used by our forefathers.”

He says—“ The objection you make  
to rectifying our alphabet, ‘that it  
will be attended with inconveniences  
and difficulties,’ is a natural one, for  
it always occurs when a reformation  
is proposed, whether in religion, gov-  
ernment or laws, even down to roads  
and wheel carriages.  
  
“The true question then, is not  
whether there will be no difficulties  
or inconveniences, but whether the  
difficulties may not be surmounted,  
  
  
  
and whether the conveniences will  
  
  
  
not, on the whole, be greater than  
the inconveniences. In this case the  
difficulties are only in the beginning  
of the practice: when they are once  
overcome, the advantages are last-  
ing. To either you or me, who spell  
wellin the present mode, I imagine  
the difficulty of changing that mode  
for the new is not so great but that  
we might perfectly get over it in a  
week’s writing. As for those who  
do not spell well, if the two difficul-  
ties are compared, viz: that of teach-  
ing them true spelling in the present  
mode, and that of teaching them the  
new alphabet, and the new spelling  
according to it, I am confident that  
the latter would be far the best. They  
uaturally fall into the new mode al-  
ready, as much as the imperfection of  
their alphabet will admit of; their  
present bad spelling is only bad be-  
cause contrary to present bad rules;  
under the new rules, it would be  
good. The difficulty of learning to  
spell well in the old way is so great  
that few attain it, thousands and  
thousands write on to old age with-  
out ever being able to acquire it. It  
is besides a difficulty continually in-  
creasing, as the sound gradually va-  
ries more and more from the spelling;  
and to foreigners it makes the learn-  
ing tc pronounce our language as  
  
written in our books almost impossi- |  
  
ble.  
  
Now as to the inconveniences you  
mention. The first is that all our  
etymologies would be lost, conse-  
quently we could not ascertain the  
meaning of many words.  
  
“Etymologies are at present very  
uncertain; but such as they are, the  
old beoks would still preserve them  
and etymologists would there find  
them. Words, in the course of time  
change their mtaning as well as their

aman a knave and a villain he would  
hardly be satisfied with my telling

signified only alad or servant; and  
the other an under ploughman, or in-  
habitant of a village. It is from  
present usage only that the meaning  
of words is to be determined.  
  
‘¢ Your second inconvenience is that  
‘the distinction between words of  
different meaning and similar sound  
would be destroyed.’ That distinc-  
tion is already destroyed in pronoun-  
cing them; and we rely on the sense  
alone of the sentence to ascertain  
which of the several words similar in  
sound we intend, If this is sufficient  
in the rapidity of discourse, it. will  
be much more so in written senten-  
ces which may be read leisurely, and  
attended to more particularly in case  
of difficulty, than we can attend toa  
past sentence while the speaker is  
hurrying us along with new ones.  
  
Your third inconvenience is that  
all the books already written would  
be useless. This inconvenience would  
only come on gradually in a course of  
ages. Youand I, and «ther now liv-  
ing readers would hardly forget the  
use of them. People would long  
  
learn to read the 6td writing though  
they practiced the new, and the in-  
convenience is not greater than what  
has already happened in a similar  
case in Italy. Formerly its inhabit-  
ants all spoke and wrote Latin: as  
the language changed the spelling fol-  
lowed it. It is true that at present a  
mere unlearned Italian cannot read  
Latin books, though they are still  
read and understood by many. But  
if the spelling had never changed, he  
would now have found it much more  
difficult to read and write his own

ters episcopus.
