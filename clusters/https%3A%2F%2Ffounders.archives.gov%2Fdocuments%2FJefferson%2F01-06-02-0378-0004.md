ue that there are grave  
arguments against its doctrine, which were not presented at  
the hearing of that cause, which might perhaps have affected  
the opinion of the chief justice; and it should not be over-  
looked that the confiscation spoken of in this dictum affects  
property already within the jurisdiction of the United States,  
and does not at all relate to enemy’s property on enemy’s  
soil.  
  
Theclause of the constitution upon which this dictum is based,  
is, like the one just considered, derived from the articles of  
confederation, where it reads as follows : ‘* Congress shall have  
the power of establishing rules for deciding in all cases  
what captures on land or water shall be legal, and in what  
manner the prizes taken on land or water shall be divided  
or appropriated.” Two powers are included in this grant ;  
first, the power to decide what captures shall be legally made ;  
and secondly, how the property captured pursuant to law  
shall be disposed of. Under the former, congress could  
direct the capture of whatever it might deem fit; while by  
the latter, the power is conferred to regulate the distribution  
and apportionment of prize.  
  
In the constitution, this clause is materially changed. No  
mention is made of the first power granted to the congress of  
the confederation, and the latter appears in a more condense
