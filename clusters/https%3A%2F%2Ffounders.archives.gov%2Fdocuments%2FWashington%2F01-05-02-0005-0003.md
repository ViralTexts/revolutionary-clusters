November 1st. Attended by the President of the State (Genl. Sullivan) Mr. Langdon, &amp; the Marshall; I went in the fore Noon to the Episcopal Church under the incumbency of a Mr. Ogden and in the Afternoon to one of the Presbeterian or Congregational Churches in which a Mr. Buckminster Preached. Dined at home with the Marshall and spent the afternoon in my own room writing letters.

Monday 2d. Having made previous preparations for it—About 8 Oclock attended by the President, Mr. Langden &amp; some other Gentlemen, I went in a boat to view the harbour of Portsmouth;  
  
which is well secured against all Winds; and from its narrow entrance from the Sea, and passage up to the Town, may be perfectly guarded against any approach by water. The anchorage is also good &amp; the Shipping may lay close to the Docks &amp;ca. when at the Town. In my way to the Mouth of the Harbour, I stopped at a place called Kittery in the Provence of Main, the River Piscataqua being the boundary between New Hampshire and it. From hence I went by the Old Fort (formerly built while under the English government) on an Island which is at the Entrance of the Harbour and where the Light House stands. As we passed this Fort we were saluted by 13 Guns. Having Lines we proceeded to the Fishing banks a little with out the Harbour and fished for Cod—but it not being a proper time of tide we only caught two—with wch. about 1 Oclock we returned to Town. Dined at Col. Langdons, and drank Tea there with a large Circle of Ladies and retired a little after Seven O’clock. Before dinner I recd. an address from the Town—presented by the Vice-President and returned an answer in the Evening to one I had recd. from Marblehead and an other from the Presbiterian Clergy of the State of Massachusetts &amp; New Hampshire delivered at Newbury Port; both of which I had been unable to answer before.

Tuesday 3d. Sat two hours in the forenoon for a Mr.  Painter of Boston, at the Request of Mr. Brick of that place; who wrote Majr. Jackson that it was an earnest desire of many of the Inhabitants of that Town that he might be endulged. After this setting I called upon President Sullivan, and the Mother of Mr. Lear and having walked through most parts of the Town, returned by 12 Oclock when I was visited by a Clergyman of the name of Haven, who presented me with an Ear, and part of the stalk of the dying Corn, and several small pieces of Cloth which had been died with it, equal to any colours I had ever seen &amp; of various colours. This Corn was blood red &amp; the rind of the stalk deeply tinged of the same colour. About 2 Oclock I recd. an Address from the Executive of the State of New Hampshire; and in half an hour after dined with them and a large Company at their Assembly room which is one of the best I have seen any where in the United States. At half after Seven I went to the Assembly where there were about 75 well dressed, and many of them very handsome Ladies—among whom (as was also the case at the Salem &amp; Boston Assemblies) were a greater proportion with much blacker hair than are usually seen in the Southern States. About 9 I returned to my Quarters. Portsmouth it is said contains abt. 5000 Inhabitants. There are some good houses (among wch. Colo. Langdons may be esteemed the first) but in general they are indifferent; and almost entirely of wood. On wondering at this, as the Country is full of Stone and good Clay for Bricks I was told that on acct. of the fogs and damps they deemed them wholesomer and for that reason prefered wood buildings. Lumber—Fish and Pot ash with some Provisions compose the principal Articles of Export. Ship building here &amp; at Newbury Port has been carried on to a considerable extent. During &amp; for sometime after the War  
  
there was an entire stagnation to it; but it is beginning now to revive again. The number of Ships belonging to the Port are estimated at .

ls. New York, 1893–94., 3:144).  
  
  
  
  
Wednesday 4th. About half after seven I left Portsmouth, quietly &amp; without any attendance, having earnestly entreated that all parade &amp; ceremony might be avoided on my return. Before ten I reached Exeter 14 Miles distance. This is considered as the 2d. Town in New-Hampshire and stands at the head of the tide water of Piscataqua River but Ships of 3 or 400 Tonns are built at it. Above (but in the Town) are considerable Falls which supply several Grist Mills—2 Oyl Mills A Slitting Mill and Snuff Mill. It is a place of some consequence but does not contain more than 1000 Inhabitants. A jealousy subsists between this Town (where the Legislature alternately sits) and Portsmouth, which, had I known it in time, would have made it necessary to have accepted an Invitation to a Public dinner, but my arrangements having been otherwise made I could not. From hence passing through Kingstown (6 Miles from Exeter) I arrived at Haverhill about half past two &amp; stayed all Night. Walked through the Town which stands at the head of the Tide of Merrimack River and in a beautiful part of the Country. The Lands over which I travelled to day are pretty much mixed in places with Stone And the growth  
  
with Pines—till I came near to Haverhill where they disappeared, &amp; the land had a more fertile appearance. The whole were pretty well cultivated but used (principally) for Grass and Indian Corn. In Haverhill is a Duck Manufactury upon a small but ingenious scale under the conduct of Colo. . At this Manufactury one small person turns a Wheel which employs 8 Spinners, each acting independently of each other so as to occasion no interruption to the rest if any one of them is stopped—Whereas at the Boston Manufactury of this Article, each Spinner has a small girl to turn the Wheel. The Looms are also somewhat differently constructed from those of the common kind, and upon an improved plan. The Inhabitts. of this small Village were well disposed to welcome me to it by every demonstration which could evince their joy.

Thursday 5th. About Sun rise I set out, crossing the Merimack River at the Town over to the Township of Bradford and in nine Miles came to Abbots Tavern in Andover where we breakfasted, and met with much attention from Mr. Philips President of the Senate of Massachusetts, who accompanied us thro’ Bellarika [Billerica] to Lexington, where I dined, and viewed the Spot on which the first blood was spilt in the dispute with great Britain on the 19th. of April 1775. Here I parted with Mr. Philips, and proceeded on to Watertown, intending (as I was disappointed by the Weather &amp; bad Roads from travvelling through the Interior Country to Charlestown on Connecticut River) to take what is called the Middle Road from Boston. The Country from Haverhill to Andover is good, and well cultivated. In and about the latter (which stands high) it is beautiful. A Mile or two from it you descend into a pine level pretty Sandy, and mixed with Swamps; through which you ride several Miles till you begin to ascend the heights on which the Town of Bellarika stands, which is also pleasantly situated 10 Miles from Andover. From hence to Lexington—8 Miles and thence to Watertown 8 More the Country is very pleasant, and the roads in general good. We lodged in this  
  
place at the House of a Widow Coolidge near the Bridge, and a very indifferent one it is.

 home, and the wife sick, we could not gain admittance which was the reason of my coming on to Tafts; where, though the people were obliging, the entertainment was not very inviting.  
  
  
GW apparently found these accommodations adequate. On 8 Nov. he wrote Samuel Taft: “Being informed that you have given my name to one of your Sons, and called another after Mrs. Washington’s family. And being moreover very much pleased with the modest and innocent looks of your two daughters Patty and Polly I do, for these reasons, send each of these Girls a piece of chintz. And to Patty, who bears the name of Mrs. Washington, and who waited more upon us than Polly did, I send five guineas, with which she may buy herself any little ornaments she may want, or she may dispose of them in any other manner more agreeable to herself. As I do not give these things with a view to have it talked of, or even to its being known, the less there is said about the matter the better you will please me; but that I may be sure the chintz and money have got safe to hand, let Patty, who I dare say is equal to it, write me a line informing me thereof directed to ‘The President of the United States at New York’” (DLC:GW). Patty, whose given name was Mercy rather than Martha, acknowledged the gifts in a letter to GW, 28 Dec. 1789 (DLC:GW).

Tuesday 10th. Left Hartford about 7 Oclock &amp; took the Middle Road (instead of the one through Middleton which I went). Breakfasted at Worthington in the Township of Berlin, at the House of one Fuller. Bated at Smiths on the plains of Wallingford 13 Miles from Fullers, which is the distance Fullers is from Hartford—and got into New Haven which is 13 Miles more, about half an hour before Sun-down. At this place I met Mr. Gerry in the Stage from New York who gave me the first certn. acct. of the health of Mrs. Washington.  
  
  
The Fuller with whom GW breakfasted is probably Ephraim Fuller, listed in the 1790 census as a resident of Berlin (HEADS OF FAMILIES, CONN.Heads of Families at the First Census of the United States Taken in the Year 1790: Connecticut. 1908. Reprint. Spartanburg, S.C., 1964., 34).  
  
  
Elbridge Gerry, United States congressman from Massachusetts, was probably on his way to his home, Elmwood, in Cambridge, where he had lived since 1787.  
  
  
  
  
  
Wednesday 11th. Set out about Sunrise, and took the upper Road to Milford, it being shorter than the lower one through West haven. Breakfasted at the former—Bated at Fairfield and dined and lodged at a Majr. Marvins 9 Miles further; which is not a good House, though the People of it were disposed to do all they cou’d to accomodate me.  
  
  
Ozias Marvin’s tavern was located “on the Westport-Norwalk road, at the intersection of the King’s Highway with the turnpike. Washington is said to have eaten only bread and milk” (CROFUTFlorence S. Marcy Crofut. Guide to the History and the Historic Sites of Connecticut. 2 vols. New Haven, 1937., 1:162).  
  
  
  
  
Thursday 12th. A little before Sunrise we left Marvins and breakfasting at Stamford 13 Miles distant, reached the Widow Havilands 12 Miles further; where, on acct. of some lame horses, we remained all Night. The badness of these Rds. having been described as I went, I shall say nothing of them now.  
  
  
  
Friday 13th. Left Mrs. Havilands as soon as we could see the Road and breakfasted at Hoyets Tavern this side Kings-bridge and between two and three Oclock arrived at my House at New York where I found Mrs. Washington and the rest of the family all well. And its being Mrs. Washington’s Night to receive visits a pretty large Company of Ladies and Gentlemen were present

Sunday 15th. Went to St. Pauls Chapel in the forenoon and after returning from thence was visited by Majr. Butler Majr. Meridith and Mr. Smith So. Cara. Received an Invitation to attend the Funeral of Mrs. Roosevelt (the wife of a Senator of this State) but declined complying with it—first because the propriety of accepting any invitation of this sort appeared very questionable and secondly (though to do it in this instance might not be improper) because it might be difficult to discriminate in cases wch. might thereafter happen.

He was generally popular in New York, although Sen. William Maclay termed him “gaudy as a peacock” (MACLAYCharles A. Beard, ed.

thousand inhabitants. “There are some good houses (among which  
Colonel Langdon’s may be esteemed the first), but in general they are  
indifferent, and almost entirely of wood. On wondering at this, as the  
country is full of stone and good clay for bricks, I was told that on

On Tuesday a public dinner was given in honor of the President,  
attended by the principal officers of the state government, the clergy, the  
members of the bar, and eminent private citizens; and after the first  
toast, Washington himself arose and offered, “The State of New Hamp-  
shire,” which created the utmost enthusiasm. The same evening, he  
writes: “ At half after seven I went to the assembly, where there were  
about seventy-five well-dressed and many of them very handsome ladies  
—among whom (as was also the case at Salem and Boston assemblies)  
were a greater proportion with much blacker hair than are usually seen

TUESDAY, 3D.  
Sat two hours in the forenoon for a Mr.  
* * * , painter * * * visited by a  
clergyman by the name of Haven, who  
presented me with an Ear and part of the  
stock of the dying Corn, and several  
small pieces of cloth which had been  
dyed with it, equal to any colours I have  
ever seen, of various colours. Tne Corn  
was blood red, and the rind of the stalk  
deeply tinged of the same colour.  
About two o’clock I received an Ad­  
dress from the Executive of the State  
of New Hampshire, and, half an hour  
later, dined with them and a large  
company at their assembly room, which  
is ouo of the b st I have seen anywhere  
iu the United States. At half after  
seven, I went to the Assembly, where  
there were about 75 welt dressed, and  
many of them handsome Eadies—  
among whom [as was also the case  
at the Salem and Boston assemblies  
were a greater proportion with much  
blacker hair than are usually seen iu  
the Southern States * * * * Ports­  
mouth, it is said contains about 5,000 in­  
habitants. Tnere are some good houses  
[among w-hich Colo Langdon&#x27;s may be es­  
teemed the flrstj but in general they are  
indifferent, and made almost entirely of  
wood. On wondering at this, as the  
country is full of stone and good clay for  
bricks, 1 was told that on account of the  
fogs and damp, they deemed them whole­  
some;&#x27; and for that reason preferred  
wooden buildings. Lumber, fish and  
potash, with some Provisions, comprises  
the principal articles of export, ship­  
building here and at Newburyport, has  
been carried on to a cons derable extent.  
During, and for some time after the war,  
there was an entire stagnation to it; but  
it is beginning now to revive again. The  
number of ships belonging to the port are  
estimated at   
WEDNESDAY 4tH.  
About half after seven I left Ports­  
mouth, quietly and without any attend  
arn-e. having earnestly entreated that all  
parade and economy might be avoided on  
my return. Bolore 10 1 reached Exeter,  
14 miles distance. This is considered as  
tho second town in New Hampshire, and  
stands at the head of the tidewater of the  
Piscataqua river: but ships of 300 and 400  
tons are built at it. Anove [hut in the  
town] are considerable falls, which sup­  
ply several grist mills, two oil mills, a  
slitting mill and a snuff mill, it is a place  
oi some con3oqueu e, but does not contain  
more than 1,000 inhabitants. A jealousy  
subsists between this Town [where the  
Legislature alternately sits] and  
Portsmouth; where, had I known it in  
time would Have made it necessary to ac­  
ept an invitation to a public dinner,  
but my arrangements having been other­  
wise made, 1 could not. From hence,  
passing through Kingstown [six miles  
from Exeter] I arrived at Haverhill,  
about half-past two. and staid ail night.  
Walkod through the town, which stands  
at the head of the tide of Merrimack  
River, and in a beautiful part of the  
country, The lands over which I traveled  
to-day are prejtj! tpuqh m(x j&lt;i in prices  
with stone—and tlio growth with p.ne—

disappeared, and the land had a more fer­  
tile appearance. The whole were pretty  
woll cultivated, but used [prin­  
cipally] for grass and Indian  
corn. In Haverhill, is a duck man­  
ufactory, upon a small but ingenious  
scale, under tho conduct of Colo. * *  
At this fa -tory one small person turns a  
wheel which employs eight spinners, each  
acting independently of the other, so as  
to occasion no iut-rruption to the rest if  
any one of them is stopped— whereas, at  
the Boston manufactory each spinner has  
a small girl to turn the wheel. The looms  
arc also somewhat di Terentiy constructed  
from the common kind and upon an im­  
proved plan. Tho inhabit’ts of t]jis small  
village were well-disposed to welcome me  
to it by every demonstration which could

Tuesday, 3d: Sat two hours in the  
forenoon for a Mr. .. , Painter  
  
. . Visited by a clergyman by the  
name of Haven, who presented me  
with an Ear and part of the stock of  
the ‘dying Corn, and several small pieces  
of cloth which had been dyed with it,  
eaual to any colours I have ever seen,  
of variours. The Corn was blood red,  
and the rind of the stalk deeply tinged  
of the same colour.  
  
About two o’clock I received an Ad-  
dress from the Executive of the State  
of New Hampshé#re, and, half an hour  
later dined with them and a large com-  
pany at their assembly room, which  
is one of the best I have ever seen any-  
where in the United States. At half  
after seven, I went to the Assembly,  
where there were about 75 well dressed,  
and many of them handsome Ladies—  
among them (as was also the case at  
Salem and Boston assemblies) were a  
greater proportion with much blacker  
hair than are usually seen in the South-  
ern States . . Portsmouth, it is  
said, contains about 6000 inhabitants.  
There are some good houses (among  
which Colo Langdon’s may be esteemed  
the first) but in general they are in-  
different and made almost entirely of  
wood. On wondering at this, as the  
country is full of stone and good clay  
for bricks I was told that on acct. of  
the fogs and damp, they deemed: them  
wholesomer, and for that reason pre-  
ferred wooden buildings. Lumber, fish  
and potash, with some Provisions, com-  
prises the principal articles of export.  
Shipbuilding here and at Newburyfert.  
has been carried on to a considerable  
extent. During, and for some time  
after the war, there was an entire stag-  
nation to it; but it is beginning now to  
revive again. The number of ships be-  
longing to the port are estimated at ——  
  
Wednesday, 4th: About half after  
seven I left Portsmouth, quietly and  
without any attendance, having ear-  
nestly entreated that all parade and  
  
ceremony might be avolded on my re-  
turn. Before 10 I reached Exeter, 14  
  
still indisposed; but as it had been’  
  
.ctened to their waist.) Children  
  
where it is said, |  
  
miles distance. This ig considered as  
the second town in New Hampshire,  
and stands at the head of the tidewater  
of the Piscataqua River; but ships of 3  
and 400 tons are built at -it. Above  
(but in the Town) are considerable  
Falls, which supply several grist mills,  
2 oil mills; a slitting mill and a snuff  
mill. It is a place of some consequence  
but does not contain more than 1,000  
inhabitants. A jealousy subsists be-  
tween this Town (where the Legislature  
alternately sits) and uth; where,  
had I known it in time, would have  
made it necessary to accept an invita-  
tion to a public dinner, but my ar-  
rangements having been otherwise  
made, I could not. From hence, passing  
thro’ Kingstown (six miles from Exe-  
ter) I arrived at Haverhill, about half-  
past two, and staid all night. Walked  
through the town, which stands at  
the head of the tide of Merrimack  
River, and in a beautiful part of the  
country. The lands over which I trav-  
eled today are pretty much mixed in  
places with stone—and the growth with  
pine—till I came near to Haverhill,  
where they disappeared, and the land  
had a more fertile appearance. The  
whole were pretty well cultivated, but  
used (principally) for grass and Indian  
corn. In Haverhill is a duck manufac-  
tory, upon a small, but ingenius scale,  
under the conduct’ of Colo. . .. At  
this factory one small person turns  
a wheel which employs eight spinners,  
each acting independently of the other,  
80 aS to occasion no interruption to the  
rest if any one of them is stopped—  
whereas, at the Boston manufactory,  
each spinner has a small girl to turn  
the wheel. The looms are also some-  
what differently constructed from the  
commmon kind, and upon an improved  
pian. The inh2bit’ts of this small vil-  
lage were well-disposed to welcome me  
to it by every demonstration which  
could evince their joy.  
  
Sunday, 8th: It being contrary to law,  
and disagreeable to the People of this  
State (Connecticut) to travel on the  
Sabbath day, and my horses, after  
passing through such intolerable Roads,  
wanting rest, I stayed at@Perkins’s Tav-  
ern (which, by the way, is not a good  
one,) all day—and, a Meeting House  
being a few rods of the door, I attended  
morning and evening service, and heard  
very lame discourses from a Mr. Pond.

t November 1st.  
  
Attended by the President of the State (Genl. Suliivan), Mr. Lang-  
don, and the Marshall, I went in the forenoon to the Episcopal  
Church, under the incumbency of a Mr. Ogden; and in the afternoon  
to one of the Presbyterian or Congregational Churches, in which a  
Mr. Buckminster Preached. Dined at home with the Marshall, and  
spent the afternoon in my room writing letters.  
  
Monday, 2d.  
  
Having made previous preparations for it, about 8 o’clock, attended  
by the President, Mr. Langdon, and some other Gentlemen, I went in  
a boat to view the harbour of Portsmouth; which is well secured against  
all winds; and from its narrow entrance from the Sea, and passage  
up to the Town, may be guarded against any approach by water. The  
anchorage is also good, and the shipping may lay close to the Docks,  
&amp;c., when at the Town. In my way to the mouth of the Harbour, I  
stopped at a place called Kittery, in the Province of Maine, the river  
Piscataqua being the boundary between New Hampshire and it. From

hence I went by the old Fort (formerly built while under the English  
government) on an Island which is at the entrance of the harbour,  
and where the Light House stands. As we passed this Fort we were  
saluted by 13 Guns. Having Lines, we proceeded to the Fishing  
banks a little without the Harbour, and fished for Cod; but it not  
being a proper time of tide, we only caught two, with w’ch, about  
1 o’clock, we returned to Town. Dined at Mr. Langdon’s, and drank  
Tea there, with a large circle of Ladies, and retired a little after seven  
o’clock. Before dinner I rec’d an address from the Town, presented  
by the Vice-President; and returned an answer in the Evening to one  
I had rec’d from Marblehead, and another from the Presbyterian  
Clergy of the State of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, delivered  
at Newbury Port; both of which I had been unable to answer before.  
  
Tuesday, 3d.  
  
Sat two hours in the forenoon for a Mr.-, Painter, of Boston,  
  
at the request of Mr. Breck, of that place; who wrote Majr. Jackson  
that it was an earnest desire of many of the Inhabitants of that  
Town that he might be indulged. After this setting I called upon  
President Sullivan, and the mother of Mr. Lear, and having walked  
through most parts of the Town, returned by 12 o’clock, when I w’as  
visited by a Clergyman of the name of Haven, who presented me  
with an Ear and part of the stalk of the dyeing Corn, and several  
small pieces of Cloth which had been dyed with it, equal to any  
colours I had ever seen, of various colours. This Corn was blood  
red, and the rind of the stalk deeidy tinged of the same colour.  
  
About 2 o’clock, I received an Address from the Executive of the  
State of New Hampshire, and in half an hour after dined with them  
and a large company, at their assembly room, which is one of the  
best I have seen anywliere in the United States. At half after seven  
I went to the Assembly, where there were about 75 well dressed, and  
many of them very handsome ladies—among whom (as was also the  
case at the Salem and Boston Assemblies) were a greater proportion  
with much blacker hair than arc usually seen in the Southern States.  
About nine, I returned to my (juarters. Portsmouth, it is said, con¬  
tains 5,000 inhabitants. There are some good houses, (among which  
Col.® Langdon’s may be esteemed the first,) but in general they are  
indiflerent, and almost entirely of wood. On wondering at this, as  
the country is full of stone and good clay for bricks, I was told that  
on acet. of the fogs and damp, they deemed them wholesomer, and for  
that reason preferred wood buildings. Lumber, fish, and potash, with  
some provisions, compose the principal articles of export. Ship¬  
building here and at Newburyport, has been carried on to a consider¬  
able extent. During and for some time after the war there was an

Wednesday, 4th.  
  
About half after seven I left Portsmouth, quietly, and without any  
attendance, having earnestly entreated that ail parade and ceremony  
might be avoided on my return. Before ten I reached Exeter, 14  
miles distance. This is considered as the second town in New  
Hampshire, and stands at the head of the tide-water of Piscataqua  
River; but ships of 3 or 400 tuns are built at it. Above (but in the  
town*) are considerable falls, which supply several grist mills, 2 oyl  
mills, a slitting mill, and snuff mill. It is a place of some conse¬  
quence, but does not contain more than 1,000 inhabitants. A jealousy  
subsists between this town (where the Legislature alternately sits)  
and Portsmouth; which, had I known it in time, w&#x27;ould have made  
it necessary to have accepted an invitation to a public dinner, but my  
arrangements having lieen otherwise made, I could not. From hence,  
passing through Kingstown (6 miles from Exeter), I arrived at  
Haverhill about half-past two, and stayed all night. Walked through  
the town, which stands at the head of the tide of Merrimack River,  
and in a beautiful part of the country. The lands over which I  
travelled to-day, are pretty much mixed in places with stone — and  
the growth with pines — till I came near to Haverhill, where they dis¬  
appeared, and the land had a more fertile appearance. The whole  
were pretty well cultivated, but used (principally) for grass and  
Indian corn. In Haverhill is a Duck manufactory, upon a small but  
ingenious scale, under the conduct of Col®.At this manu¬  
  
factory one small person turns a wheel which employs eight spin¬  
ners, each acting independently of each other, so as to occasion no  
interruption to the rest if anyone of them is stopped — whereas a  
the Boston manufactory of this article, each spinner has a small girl  
to turn the wheel. The looms are also somewhat differently con¬  
structed from those of the common kind, and upon an improved plan.  
The inhabit’ts of this small village were well disposed to welcome me  
to it by every demonstration which could evince their joy.  
  
Thursday, 5th.  
  
About sunrise I set out, crossing the Merrimack River at the town,  
over to the township of Bradford, and in nine miles came to Abbot’s  
tavern, in Andover, where we breakfasted, and met with much atten¬  
tion from Mr. Phillips, President of the Senate of Massachusetts, who  
accompanied us through Bellariki to Lexington, where I dined, and  
viewed the spot on which the first blood was spilt in the dispute with

Great Britain, on the 19th of April, 1776. Here I parted with Mr.  
Phillips, and proceeded on to Watertown, intending (as I was disap¬  
pointed by the weather and bad roads from travelling through the  
Interior Country to Charlestown, on Connecticut River) to take what  
is called the middle road from Boston. The country from Haverhill  
to Andover is good, and well cultivated. In and about the latter  
(which stands high) it is beautiful. A mile or two from it you  
descend into a pine level, pretty sandy, and mixed with swamps,  
through which you ride several miles, till you begin to ascend the  
heights on which the town of Bellarika stands, which is also pleas¬  
antly situated 10 miles from Andover.
