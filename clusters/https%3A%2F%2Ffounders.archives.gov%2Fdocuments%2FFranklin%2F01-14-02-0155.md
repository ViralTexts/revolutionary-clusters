how it behaves in contact with substances and objects near the ground, and how they could protect their houses and themselves from injury during thunder storms.  
Since Franklin was writing while in Paris, he probably expected that the piece would be translated into French and published in some Parisian journal. His expectation was fulfilled, for the paper is listed as appearing under the title “Du tonnerre, et des moyens employés en Amérique pour préserver les bâtiments et les personnes de ses funestes accidents” in Mémoires pour l’histoire des sciences et des beaux-arts, Novembre, 1767, p. 197.  
  
Paris, Sept. 1767  
Experiments made in electricity first gave philosophers a suspicion that the matter of lightning was the same with the electric matter. Experiments afterwards made on lightning obtained from the clouds by pointed rods, received into bottles, and subjected to every trial, have since proved this suspicion to be perfectly well founded; and that whatever properties we find in electricity, are also the properties of lightning.  
This matter of lightning, or of electricity, is an extream subtile fluid, penetrating other bodies, and subsisting in them, equally diffused.  
When by any operation of art or nature, there happens to be a greater proportion of this fluid in one body than in another, the body which has most, will communicate to that which has least, till the proportion becomes equal; provided the distance between them be not too great; or, if it is too great, till there be proper conductors to convey it from one to the other.  
If the communication be through the air without any conductor, a bright light is seen between the bodies, and a sound is heard. In our small experiments we call this light and sound the electric spark and snap; but in the great operations of nature, the light is what we call lightning, and the sound (produced at the same time, tho’ generally arriving later at our ears than the light does to our eyes) is, with its echoes, called thunder.  
If the communication of this fluid is by a conductor, it may be without either light or sound, the subtle fluid passing in the substance of the conductor.  
If the conductor be good and of sufficient bigness, the fluid passes through it without hurting it. If otherwise, it is damaged or destroyed.  
All metals, and water, are good conductors. Other bodies may become conductors by having some quantity of water in them, as wood, and other materials used in building, but not having much water in them, they are not good conductors, and therefore are often damaged in the operation.  
Glass, wax, silk, wool, hair; feathers, and even wood, perfectly dry are non-conductors: that is, they resist instead of facilitating the passage of this suble fluid.  
When this fluid has an opportunity of passing through two conductors, one good, and sufficient, as of metal, the other not so good, it passes in the best, and will follow it in any direction.  
The distance at which a body charged with this fluid will discharge itself suddenly, striking through the air into another body that is not charged, or not so highly charg’d, is different according to the quantity of the fluid, the dimensions and form of the bodies themselves, and the state of the air between them. This distance, whatever it happens to be between any two bodies, is called their striking distance, as till they come within that distance of each other, no stroke will be made.  
The clouds have often more of this fluid in proportion than the earth; in which case as soon as they come near enough (that is, within the striking distance) or meet with a conductor, the fluid quits them and strikes into the earth. A cloud fully charged with this fluid, if so high as to be beyond the striking distance from the earth, passes quietly without making noise or giving light; unless it meets with other clouds that have less.  
Tall trees, and lofty buildings, as the towers and spires of churches, become sometimes conductors between the clouds and the earth; but not being good ones, that is, not conveying the fluid freely, they are often damaged.  
Buildings that have their roofs covered with lead, or other metal, and spouts of metal continued from the roof into the ground to carry off the water, are never hurt by lightning, as whenever it falls on such a building, it passes in the metals and not in the walls.  
When other buildings happen to be within the striking distance from such clouds, the fluid passes in the walls whether of wood, brick or stone, quitting the walls only when it can find better conductors near them, as metal rods, bolts, and hinges of windows or doors, gilding on wainscot, or frames of pictures; the silvering on the backs of looking-glasses; the wires for bells; and the bodies of animals, as containing watry fluids. And in passing thro’ the house it follows the direction of these conductors, taking as many in it’s way as can assist it in its passage, whether in a strait or crooked line, leaping from one to the other, if not far distant from each other, only rending the wall in the spaces where these partial good conductors are too distant from each other.  
An iron rod being placed on the outside of a building, from the highest part continued down into the moist earth, in any direction strait or crooked, following the form of the roof or other parts of the building, will receive the lightning at its upper end, attracting it so as to prevent its striking any other part; and, affording it a good conveyance into the earth, will prevent its damaging any part of the building.  
A small quantity of metal is found able to conduct a great quantity of this fluid. A wire no bigger than a goose quill, has been known to conduct (with safety to the building as far as the wire was continued) a quantity of lightning that did prodigious damage both above and below it; and probably larger rods are not necessary, tho’ it is common in America, to make them of half an inch, some of three quarters, or an inch diameter.  
The rod may be fastened to the wall, chimney, &amp;c. with staples of iron. The lightning will not leave the rod (a good conductor) to pass into the wall (a bad conductor), through those staples. It would rather, if any were in the wall, pass out of it into the rod to get more readily by that conductor into the earth.  
If the building be very large and extensive, two or more rods may be placed at different parts, for greater security.  
Small ragged parts of clouds suspended in the air between the great body of clouds and the earth (like leaf gold in electrical experiments), often serve as partial conductors for the lightning, which proceeds from one of them to another, and by their help comes within the striking distance to the earth or a building. It therefore strikes through those conductors a building that would otherwise be out of the striking distance.  
Long sharp points communicating with the earth, and presented to such parts of clouds, drawing silently from them the fluid they are charged with, they are then attracted to the cloud, and may leave the distance so great as to be beyond the reach of striking.  
It is therefore that we elevate the upper end of the rod six or eight feet above the highest part of the building, tapering it gradually to a fine sharp point, which is gilt to prevent its rusting.  
Thus the pointed rod either prevents a stroke from the cloud, or, if a stroke is made, conducts it to the earth with safety to the building.  
The lower end of the rod should enter the earth so deep as to come at the moist part, perhaps two or three feet; and if bent when under the surface so as to go in a horizontal line six or eight feet from the wall, and then bent again downwards three or four feet, it will prevent damage to any of the stones of the foundation.  
  
A person apprehensive of danger from lightning, happening during the time of thunder to be in a house not so secured, will do well to avoid sitting near the chimney, near a looking glass, or any gilt pictures or wainscot; the safest place is in the middle of the room, (so it be not under a metal lustre suspended by a chain) sitting in one chair and laying the feet up in another. It is still safer to bring two or three mattrasses or beds into the middle of the room, and folding them up double, place the chair upon them; for they not being so good conductors as the walls, the lightning will not chuse an interrupted course through the air of the room and the bedding, when it can go thro’ a continued better conductor the wall. But where it can be had, a hamock or swinging bed, suspended by silk cords equally distant from the walls on every side, and from the cieling and floor above and below, affords the safest situation a person can have in any room whatever; and what indeed may be deemed quite free from danger of any stroke by lightning.

XPF.RTMFNTS made in elecdricity fird gave * philolb-

fame w iih the elec^tric matter. Experiments afterwards made  
on lightniiig obtained from the clouds by pointed rods, recei-*  
ved jiiio bottles, and fubjected to every trial, have fince pro¬  
ved this fufpicion to he perfec^tly well founded ; &#x27;and that  
whatever properties we find in electricity, are alfo the pro¬  
perties of lightning. • • ^  
  
&#x27; This matter of lightning, or of electricity, is an extrene  
fibtlle fluid, penetiaiing other bodies, and iubfiding in them,  
equally diiT.ifed. * ^  
  
When, hv any operation of art or nature, there.happens*to  
be a grt atcr proportion of this lliiid in one body than in aao-  
ther, the body which has mod will communicate to that  
which has lead, until the proportion becomes equal; provi¬  
ded the didance bet*vceu them be not too great; or, if it is  
too’great, till there be proper condmdors to convey,it from  
the one to the other.  
  
« If the communication be through the air without any con¬  
ductor, a bright light is feen between the bcnlies, and a (bund*  
is heard. In our fmall experiments we call this light and  
found the ele&lt;dric fpark and fnap ;&#x27; but in the great opera¬  
tions of nature, the light is what we call lightning, and the  
found (produced at the fame time, though generally arriving  
later at our ears than the light does to our eyes) is, wdth its’  
echoes, called thunder, » *  
  
If the communication of this fluid is by a condutdor, it may&#x27;  
be without either light or found, the fubtile fluid psfling in  
the fiibdance of the conductor.  
  
If the conductor be good, and of fufficient bignefs, the fl^wd  
pafTes through it without hurting it,’ If utherwife, it da*  
maged or dedroyed, - ^ *  
  
All metals and water ate good condiwdors* — Other bodies  
may become condnclors, by having l&lt;&gt;me quantity of» water di

and therefore are often damaged in the operation.  
  
Ghfs, wax, filk, wool, hair, feathers, and even wood, per^  
feclly dry, are non-condu&lt;^tors \ that is, they reiift tnilead of  
facilitating the paflage of this fubtile fluid. -  
  
Wiien this fluid has an opportunity of pafling through two  
conJii &#x27;tors, one good and fiifhcient, as of metal, the other not  
fo gooil, it pafles in the beft, and will follow it in any direct  
tion, . ...

difch.irge itfelf fuddenly, ftriking through the air into ano.  
ther body, that is not charged, or hot fo highly charged, it  
clliferent, according to the quantity of fluid, the dixnenfKjni  
and form of the bodies themfelves, and the flate of the air  
between them. This diflance, whatever it happens to be, be#  
tween any two bodies, is called their ftriking diftance, as^ till  
they (*ome within that diftance of each other, no ftroke w ill  
be made.  
  
The clouds have often more of this fluid in proportion than  
the earth ; in which cafe, as foon as they come near enough  
(that is, within the ftriking diftance), or meet with a conduc#  
tor, the fluid quits them, and ftrikes into the earth. A cloud  
fully charged w ith this fluid, if fo high as to be beyond the  
ftriking dillance from the earth, pafles quietly without making  
noife, or giving light j unlefs it meets with other clouds that  
have lefs. • &gt; i  
  
Tall trees and lofty buildings, as the towers and fpires of  
churches, become (bmetimes conduiftors between the cloiidt  
and the earth ; but not being good ones, that is, not convey#  
ing the fluid freely, they are often damaged.  
  
‘ Buildings that have their roofs covered with lead, or othe#  
metal, and fpouts of metal continued from the roof unto the  
ground to carry off the water, are never hurt by lightning,a  
whenever it falls on fuch a building, it paflTes in the metals^

partial good conductors are too dlitaiu from each other.

the higheit part, contimied donii into the moift earth, in any  
dirccition, ilraight or crooked*, follo\\&#x27;ing the fonn of the roof,

its upper end, attracting it fo as to prevent its ftrikin^any o#  
thci part ; and, affording it a good conveyance into the earth,  
will prevent its damaging any part of the building, . .  
  
A rinuli quantity ot metal is found able to conducfl a great I  
quaniiiy of this fluid. A wire no bigger than a goofe-quili, . t  
  
has been known to conduct (with fafety to the building, fa# j  
  
far as tlic wire was coutiimeil) a quantity of lightning that  
did prodigious damage both above and below it ; and proba*  
bly larger rods are not net elfary, though it is common in A-*  
mcrica to make them of half an inch, ioine of three quarter^  
or an inch, diameter.  
  
The rod may be faftened touhe wall, chimney, &amp;c. with**  
ftaplcs of iron,—The lightniiig will not leave the rod (a good  
coudutl^ior) to pafs into the wail (a bad condinitor) through  
thofe llaples.—It would rather, if any were in the w&#x27;all, pais  
out of it into the rod, to get more readily by that conductor*  
into ilie earth. &#x27;  
  
If the building be veiy large and extenlive, two or more&#x27;* *  
lods may be placed at different parts, for greater feenrity.  
  
Small ragged parts of ^londs fufpended in* tlie air. between  
the great body of clouds and tlie earth, (like leaf gold in c-  
IcCli ical jexperiments) often ferve as partial condutftors for the  
lightning, which, proceeds from one of them to another, and,  
by their help, conies within the itriking diftance to the earth,  
or a building. It therefore flrikes through, thofe condu^Iorj

• Experiments made in electricity first  
gave philosophers a* suspicion that the  
matter of liginning w^as the same with  
the electric matter. Experiments after¬  
wards made on lightning obtained from  
the clouds by pointed rods, received into  
bottles, and subjected to every trial, have  
since proved this suspicion to he perfect¬  
ly.well founded ; and that whatever pro¬  
perties we find ill electricity, are also the  
properties of lightning.  
  
This matter of lightning, or of elec¬  
tricity, is an extreme subtle fluid, pene¬  
trating other bodies, and subsisting in  
them, equally diffused.  
  
TttE EVENING FIRE-SIDE.  
  
. When by any operation of art or na¬  
ture, there happens to. be a greater pro¬  
portion of this fluid m one body than in  
another, the body which has most, will  
commanicacc to that which has least, till  
the proportion becomes equal ; provided  
the distance between them be not too  
great; or, if it is too great, till there be  
proper conductors to convey it from one  
to the other.  
  
If the communication be through the  
air without any conductor, a bright light  
is seen between the bodies, and a sound  
is heard. In* our small experiments we  
call this light and sound the electric spark  
and snap ; but in the. great operations of  
nature, the light is what we call lightnings  
and the sound (produced at the same  
time, though &#x27;generally arriving later at  
our ears than the light does^o our eyes)  
is, with its echoes, called thunder.  
  
If the communication of this fluid is  
by a conductor, it may be without either  
light or sound, the subtle fluid passing  
in the substance,of the conductor.  
  
If the conductor be good and of suffi¬  
cient bigness, the fluid passes through  
it without hurting it. If otherwise, it  
is damaged or destroyed.  
  
All metals, and water, are good con¬  
ductors.—Other bodies may l&gt;ecome con¬  
ductors by having soine quantity of water  
in them, as wood, and other materials  
used in building, but not having much  
water in- them, they are not good cpn-  
ductors, and therefore are often damaged  
in the operation.  
  
Glass, wax, silk, wool, hair, feathers,  
and even wood, perfectly dry, arc non-  
ductors : that is, they resist instead of  
facilitating the passage of this subtle  
fluid.  
  
When this fluid has an opportunity of  
passing through two conductors, one  
good, and sufficient, as of metal, the  
other not so good, it passes in the best,  
and will follow it in any direction.  
  
• I&#x27;he distance at which a body charged  
with this fluid will discharge itself sud-  
denl}’, striking through the air into ano¬  
ther body that is not charged, or not  
so highly charged, is different accord¬  
ing to the quantity of the fluid, the  
dimensions and form of the bodies  
themselves, and the state of the air be¬  
tween, thenri.—This distance, whatever  
it happens to be between any two bodies,  
is called their. dhtances^^ till they  
come within that distance of each other,  
no stroke will be made.  
  
The clouds have often more of this  
fluid, in proportion than the earth ; in  
  
247  
  
which case as soon as they come near  
enough (that is,&#x27; within the strikixg dis¬  
tance) or meet with a conductor, the  
fluid quits them and strikes into the earth.  
A cloud fully charged with this fluid, if  
so high as to be beyond the striking dis¬  
tance from the earth, passes quietly with¬  
out making noise or giving light; unless  
it meets with other clouds that have less.  
  
1 all trees, and lofty buildings, as the  
towers and spires of churches, become  
sometimes conductors between the clouds  
and the earth ; but not being good ones,  
that is, not conve) ing the fluid freely,  
they are often damaged.-  
  
Buildings that have their roofs covered&#x27;  
with lead, or other metal, and spouts of  
metal continued from the roof into the  
ground to carry off the water, are never  
hurt by lightning, as whenever it falls on  
such a building, it passes in the metals  
and not in the walls.  
  
When other buildings happen to be  
within the striking distance from such  
clouds, the fluid passes&#x27;in the walls whe¬  
ther of wood, brick, or stone, quitting  
the walls only when it can find better  
conductors near them, as metal rotls,.  
bolts, and hinges of windows or doors,,  
gilding on wainscot, or frames of pic¬  
tures ; the silvering on the backs of look-  
; the wires for bells ; and the  
bodies of animals, as containing watery,  
fluids. And in passing through the  
house it follows the direction of these*  
conductors, taking as many in its way as  
can as.sist it in its passage, whether in a  
straight or crooked line, leaping from one  
to the other, if not fir distant from each-  
other,&#x27; only rending the wall in the spaces*  
where these partial good conductors are  
too distant from each other..  
  
,An iron rod being placed on the out¬  
side of a building from the highest part  
continued down into the moist earth, .in&#x27;  
any direction straight orcrooked,follow ing  
the form of the roof or other parts of.the?  
building, will receive the lightning at its  
upper end,.attracting it so as to prevent  
its striking 4hiy other part; and, affording  
it a good conveyance into the earth, will  
prevent its damaging any part of the-  
building.. &#x27;

In ease a thander-storm were to happen while a person is  
in a house not furnished with a proper condactor, it is advise-  
able not to stand near places where there is any metal, as chim-  
nies, gilt frames, iron casements, or the like, but to gointo the

non-conductor that can be found at hand, asan old chair, stool,

conductors as the walls, the lightning will not choose an inter-

d, it would appear that  
more than half the damage by fire for a year  
past, has been occasioned by lightning, and  
would go far toward paying the expense of  
conductors to every building of value, in the  
country. If a regard to property alone were  
to influence us, we should obtain them, as  
the cheapest insurance which possibly can be  
effected ;—but when we consider the loss of  
human life, and the constant exposure of  
It, how infinitely are the inducements  
increased for using every possible safeguard  
against this destructive element.  
We annex a selection from the works of  
Frankliu, on  
ELECTRICITY.  
Experiments made in electricity first gave  
{ihilosophers a suspicion, that the matter of  
ightning was the same with electric matter.  
Experiments afterwards made on lightning,  
obtained from the clouds by pointed rods, re­  
ceived into bottles, and subjected to every  
trial, have since proved this suspicion to be  
perfectly well founded ; and whatever pro­  
perties we find in electricity, are also the pro­  
perties of lightning.  
This matter of lightning, or of electricity,  
is an extreme subtle fluid, penetrating- her  
bodies, and subsisting iu them equally diffus­  
ed.  
When, by an operation of art or nature,  
there happens to be a greater proportion of  
this fluid in one body than in another, the  
body which has nioSt will communicate to  
that which has least, till the proportion be­  
comes equal, provided the distance between  
them be not too great; or, if it is too great,  
till there be proper conductors to convey it  
from one to the other.  
If the communication be through the air,  
without any conductor, a bright light is seen  
between the two bodies, and a sound is heard.  
In our small experiments we cull this light  
and sound the electric spark and snap ; but  
in the great operations of nature, the light is  
what we call lightning, and the sound (pro­  
duced at the same time, though generally  
arriving later at our ears than the light does  
to our eyes) is, with its echoes, called  
thunder.  
If the communication of thi* fluid is«f»y a  
conductor, it may be without cither light or  
sound, the subtle fluid passing in the sub­  
stance of the conductor.  
If the conductor be good and of sufficient  
bigness, the fluid passes through it without  
baiting it. If otherwise it is damages! or de­  
stroyed.  
All metals, and water, are good conduct-  
Other bodies may become conductors  
by having some quantity of water in them,  
as wood, and other materials used in building,  
but not having much water in them, they arc  
not good conductors, and therefore are often  
damaged in the operation.  
Glass, wax, silk, wool, hair, feathers, anff  
even wood perfectly dry, ate non conductors;  
that is, they resist instead of facilitating the  
passage of this subtle fluid.  
When the fluid has an opportunity of pass­  
ing through two conductors, one good, and  
sufficient, as of metal, the other not so good,  
it passes in the best, and will follow it in any  
direction.  
The distance at which a body charged  
with this fluid will discharge itself&#x27; suddenly,  
striking through the air into another body that  
is not charged, or not so highly charged, is  
different according to the quantity of th%  
fluid, the dimensions and forms of the bodies  
themselvos, and the state of the air between  
them. This distance, whatever it happens to  
be between the two bodies, is called their  
striking distance, as, till they come within  
that distance of each other, no stroke will be  
made.  
The clouds have often more of this fluid in  
proportion, than the earth ; in which case, as  
soon as they come near enough (that is, with­  
in the striking distance) or meet with a con­  
ductor, the fluid quits them and strikes into  
the earth. A cloud fully charged with this  
fluid, if so high as to be beyond the striking  
distance from the earth, passes quietly with­  
out making noise or giving light ; unless it  
meets with other clouds that have less.  
Tall trees, and lofty buildings, as the tow­  
ers and spires of churches, hecomc sometimes  
conductors between the clouds aud the earth;  
but not being good ones, that is, not convey­  
ing the fluid freely, they are often damaged.  
Buildings that have their roofs covered with  
lead, or other metal continued from the roof  
into the ground, to carry off* the water, are  
never hurt by lightning; as, whenever it  
falls on such a building, it passes in the  
metals and not in the walls.  
When other buildings happen to be within  
tho striking distance from such clouds, the  
fluid passes in the walls, whether of wood,  
brick, or stone, quitting the walls only when  
A can find better conductors near them, as  
metal rods, bolts, and hinges of windows or  
doore, gilding on wainscot, or frames of pic­  
tures, the silvering on the backs of looking  
glasses, the wire for bells, and the bodies of  
animals, as containing watery fluids. And in  
passing through the house, it follows the di­  
rection of these conductors, taking as many  
m its way as can assist it in its passage,  
whether in a straight or crooked line, leaping  
from one to the other, if not far distant from  
each other, only rending the wall in the  
spaces where these partially good conductors  
are too distant from each other.  
An iron rod being placed on the outside of  
a building, from the highest part, continued  
down into the moist earth, in any direction,  
strait or crooked, following the form of the  
roof or other parts of the building, will receive  
the lightning- at its upper end, attracting it  
to as to prevent its striking any other part of  
the building.  
The rod may b* fastened to the wall, chira-  
Bey, &amp;c. with staples of iron. The lightning  
will not leave the rod (a good conductor) to  
pass into the wall (a bad conductor) through  
the staples. U would rather, ifany where in  
the wall, pass out of it into tho rod to get  
  
more readily by that conductor Into the  
earth.  
If the building be very large and extensive,  
two or more rod* may be placed at different  
parts, for greater security.  
Small ragged parts of clouds, suspended in  
the air between the great body of clouds and  
the earth (like leaf gold in electrical experi­  
ment) often serve as partial conductors for the  
lightning, which proceeds from one of them to  
another, and by their help comes within the  
striking distance to the earth or a building.  
It therefore strikes through those conductors a  
building that would otherwise be out of the  
striking distance.  
Long sharp points communicating with the  
earth, and presented to such parts of the  
clouds, drawing silently from them the fluid  
they are charged with, they are then attract­  
ed to the cloud, and may leave the distance  
so great as to be beyond the reach of striking.  
It is therefore that we elevate the upper  
end of the rod six or eight feet above the  
highest part of the building, tapering it gra­  
dually to a sharp point, which is gilt, to pre­  
vent its rusting.  
Thus the pointed rod either prevents a  
stroke from the clouds, or if a stroke is made,  
conducts it to the earth with safety to the  
building.  
T he lower end of the rod should enter the  
earth so deep as to come at the moist part,  
perhaps two or three feet; and it bent when  
under the surface, so as to go in a horizontal  
line six or eight feet from the wall, and then  
bent again downwards three or lour feet, it  
will prevent damage to any of the stones of  
the foundation.  
t A person apprehensive of danger from light­  
ning, happening during time of thimder to be  
in a house not so secured, will do well to  
avoid sitting near the chimney, near a look­  
ing-glass, or any gilt pictures or wainecot;  
the safest place is the middle of the room (so  
it be not under a metal lustre suspended by a  
chain) sitting in one chair, aud laying the  
feet up in another. It is still safer to bring  
two or three mattresses or beds into the mid­  
dle of the room, aud, folding them up double,  
place the chair upon them ; for they not be­  
ing so good conductors as the walls, the  
lightning will not choose an interrupted  
course through the air of the room and the  
bedding, when it can go through a continued  
better conductor, the wall

PLACES OF SAFETY IN TIMES OF THUN-

Dr Franklin’s advice was to sit in the middle of |  
  
a room, provided it was not under a metal lustre |  
suspended by a chain, sitting on one chair andj  
laying the feet on another. It is still better, he|  
observed, to bring two or three mattresses or}

will not be so likely to pass through them. Bu

A small quantity of metal is found to  
conduct a great quantity of this fluid. A  
wire no bigger than a goose-quill, has been  
known to conduct (with safety to the build-  
ing, as far as the wire was continued,) a  
quantity of lightning that did prodigious  
damage both above and below it; and  
probably larger rods are not necessary,  
though it is common in America, to make  
them of half an inch, and some of three  
quarters, or an inch in diameter.  
  
The rod may be fastened to the wall,  
chimney, &amp;c. with staples of iron. The  
lightning ‘will not leave the rod (a good  
conductor,) to pass into the wall, (a bad  
conductor,) through those  staples.—lIt  
would rather, if any were in the wall, pass  
out of it into the rod to get more readily  
by that conductor into the earth,  
  
If the building be very large and exten-  
sive, two or more rods may be placed at  
different parts for greater security.  
  
Small ragged parts of clouds suspended  
in the air, between the great body of clouds  
and the earth, (like leaf gold in electri-  
cal experiments,) often serve as partial con-  
ductors for the lightning, which proceeds  
from one of them to another, and by their  
help comes within the striking distance to  
the earth or a building. It therefore strikes  
through those parts of a building that would  
otherwise be out of the striking distence.  
  
It is therefore proper to elevate the upper  
end of the rod six or eight feet above the  
highest part of the building, tapering it  
gradually to a fine sharp point, which  
should be gilt te prevent its rusting.

The pointed rod will thus either prevent  
a stroke from the cloud, or, if a strokg

## [Advice During Thunder and Lightning.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/162173059)

Advice During Thunder and Lightning. A  
person apprehensive of danger from  
lightning, happening during the time of  
the thunder to be iu a house not secured  
by conductors, would do well to avoid  
sitting near the chimney, near a  
looking-glass, or any gilt pictures or  
wainscot. The safest place is the middle  
of the room, so it be not: under a metal  
lustre suspended by a chain, sitting 111  
fone chair, and laying the feet up in  
another. It is still safer to bring two  
or three mattresses or beds into the  
middle of the room, and, folding them up  
double, place the chair upon them : for,  
these not being so good conductors as  
the walls, the lightning will not choose  
an interrupted course through the air of  
the room and the bedding when it can go  
througli a continued better conductor—  
the wall. But, where it can be had, a  
hammock or swinging bed, suspended by  
silk cords equally distant, from the  
wall 011 every side, and from the
