To the President and Directors of the Literary fund.In obedience to the law requiring that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia should make report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary fund (to be laid before the legislature at their next succeeding session) embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of the sd University, the sd Rector and Visitors make the followingReport.In that of the preceding year it was stated that the buildings for the accomodation of the Professors &amp; Students were in readiness for their occupation, and that the walls of the larger building, intended for a Library and other purposes, were compleated! in the course of this present season  this building has recieved it’s roof, and will be put into a condition for preservation and use, although it’s interior cannot be compleated. it was then also stated that, without awaiting that completion, the institution might be put into operation at the close of this present year were it’s funds liberated from the incumbrances with which they were charged. this obstacle was removed by the act of the legislature of January 27. of the present year concerning the University of Virginia.Inconsequence of this liberation, the board of Visitors at their ensuing meeting, on the 5th of April last, proceeded to take such preparatory measures as could be taken at that time to carry the views of the legislature into effect with as little delay as practicable. from the accounts and estimates then rendered by the Bursar and Proctor, it appeared that on the last day of the preceding year, 1823 the funds in hand and due to the University, of the last loan, and of the arrearages of subscriptions, would be sufficient, when recieved,  to pay all debts then existing on any account, and to leave a sum of about 21,000.D. applicable to the building of the Library; which with the sum of 19,370. D 40½  already paid or provided for that edifice, would put it into a state of safety, and of some uses, until other and more pressing objects should have been accomplished. they considered the University therefore as having had in hand, on the 1st day of the present year 1824. the annuity of this year (clear of all prior claims) as a fund for defraying the current expences of the year, for meeting those necessary towards procuring Professors, paying any commencements of salaries which might be incurred to the end of the year, and to leave a small surplus for contingencies.They found, from a view of the future income, consisting of the annuity, and such rents for buildings as may be reasonably required, that it would not be adequate to the full establishment of the 10. Professorships contemplated by the legislature in their act of Jan. 25. 1819. for establishing the University; but that it might suffice for instituting 8. professorships, for the present, and that the branches of science proposed to be taught in the University might be arranged within the competence of that number, for a time, and until future &amp; favorable circumstances might enable them to add the others, and to lighten  duly the professorships thus overcharged with duties.They proceeded therefore to settle the organisation of the schools, and the distribution of the sciences among them, and they concluded on the same as follows.In the University of Virginia shall be instituted eight professorships, to wit. 1st of Antient languages; 2dly Modern languages; 3. Mathematics; 4. Natural philosophy; 5 Natural history; 6. Anatomy and Medecine; 7. Moral Philosophy; 8. Law.In the school of Antient languages  are to be taught the higher grade of the Latin and Greek languages, the Hebrew, rhetoric, belles lettres, antient history &amp; antient geography.In the school of Modern languages  are to be taught French, Spanish, Italian, German, and the English language in it’s Anglo-Saxon form; also Modern history, &amp; modern geography.In the school is Mathematics  are to be taught Mathematics generally, including the higher branches of Numerical arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry plane and spherical, geometry, mensuration, navigation, conic sections, fluxions or differentials, military and civil architecture.In the school of Natural philosophy  are to be taught the laws and properties of bodies generally, including mechanics, statics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, pneumatics, acoustics, optics, and astronomy.In the school of Natural history  are to be taught, botany, zoology, mineralogy, chemistry, geology, and rural economy.In the school of Anatomy and   Medecine are to be taught anatomy surgery, the history of the progress and theories of medecine, physiology, pathology, materia medica and pharmacyIn the school of Moral philosophy  are to be taught Mental science generally including ideology, general grammar, and ethics.In the school of Law  are to be taught the Common and Statute law, that of the Chancery, the laws Feudal, civil, mercatorial, maritime and of Nature and Nations; and also the principles of government &amp; Political economy.But it was meant that this distribution should give way to occasional interchanges of particular branches of science, among the professors, in accomodation to their respective qualifications.The Visitors were sensible that there might be found in the different seminaries of the US. persons qualified to conduct these several schools with entire competence; but it was neither probable they would leave the situations in which they then were, nor honorable or moral to endeavor to seduce them from their stations: and to have filled the professional chairs with unemployed and secondary characters, would not have fulfilled the object, or satisfied the expectations of our country in this institution. it was moreover believed that, to advance in science, we must avail ourselves of the lights of countries already advanced before us. it was therefore deemed most advisable to resort to Europe for some of the professors, and of preference to the countries which speak the same language, in order to obtain characters of the first grade of science in their respective lines. and, to make the selection with proper information, caution and advisement, it was necessary to send an agent of science and confidence. Francis W. Gilmer, a learned and trustworthy citizen of this state, was appointed, and has proceeded on the mission;  and should his objects be accomplished as early as expected, we count on opening the institution on the 1st day of February next.Could the donation of the last legislature, out of the debt due to this state from the US. have been obtained for the purposes of procuring a library and the apparatus necessary for the several schools the opportunity would have been highly advantageous of having them chosen by this agent, while in Europe, with the advice and assistance of the respective professors. but  the application was not in time to  be acted on before the adjournment of the late Congress. yet some books were indispensible, and some apparatus to make even an imperfect commencement. to procure these articles therefore, &amp; to defray the expences necessary for the other objects of the mission, the board was under the necessity of applying to these purposes a sum of 10,500.D. of the annuity of the present year, and to leave the internal finishing of the Library, however much to be regretted, until some opportunity of greater convenience should occur.There is some reason to doubt, from information recieved whether our agent will be able to effect his objects at as early a day as we had expected. but of this more will be known in time for it’s communication by the Rector with this Report. were it still possible to obtain from the US. a settlement of so much of the claim on them as was appropriated to this institution, in time to find our agent and professors yet in place to invest it, our University would open under auspices highly propitious in comparison with those to which it will be subjected by this unfortunate delay.The success of our Collector in his applications for the arrearages due from subscribers, has not been as great as it has been in further securing the sums which had not yet been secured. the reciepts from this resource, since the date of our last Report have amounted to 2069. D 88.½ C — and the sums deemed sperate and still to be recieved amount to 7468. D 92½ C.The accounts of the reciepts, disbursements, and funds on hand for the year ending with the last month of September, as rendered by the Bursar and Proctor, are given with this Report as is required by law.Th: Jefferson RectorOct 5. 1824.

llowing KKi’OUT.  
In that of the preceding year it was stated  
that the buddings, lor the accommodation of  
tlio Professors and Students, were in nadinegg  
lor tln ir occupation, and that the walls of the  
larger building, intended for a library, and oth­  
er purposes, were completed. In the course  
of ttu: present season this building hits received  
its roof, and will be put into a condition for  
preservation and use, although its interior can­  
not be completed. It was then also stated,  
thaf, without awaiting that completion, the in­  
stitution might he put into operation at the  
close of this present year, were its funds libe­  
rated from the incumbrances with which they  
vvti e »iuuged. Tniso Stacie was removed by&#x27;  
the act nl the Legislature ut .1 tmiary 27, of  
the present year, concerning the UiuveiMiy ol  
Virginia.  
I o consequence of tills liberation, the Board  
ot Visitors, at their ensuing meting on the 5th  
ol spill last, proceeded to lake such prepara­  
tion measures os could he taken at that time,  
to i ai ry the v lew s of the I.egislature into cfIVcl  
vv it it as little delay as practicable, l&#x27;rom the  
account- U. estiiir.it &lt;-s then rendered by tin* But -  
Proctor, it appeared that on the last day of  
t lie prect ding y ear, 1C23,1 lie. funds in band, and  
dm* vo the Uiiiv&#x27;eroiiy, of the l ist loan, and of  
•be arrearages of subscriptions, would hesufli­  
cirnt, w hen received, to pay all debts then ‘•x­  
islliigon any account, and to leave a sum ofa­  
hotii 521,Out), applicable, to the building of the  
Libraiy; winch, with the sum of £19,370 40 1-2  
already paid, oi provided for that edifice,  
would po it into a state of safely and of some  
uses, until other and more pressing objects  
should have been accomplished. Tin y consi­  
dered the University, therefore, as having had  
in hand on the first day of the present year,  
182 l, tin: annuity of this year (clear of all pmo  
claims)as a fund for defraying the current ex­  
pense* of tin; year, lor meeting those uecessa  
ry towards procuring Professors, paying any  
commencement of salaries, which might he in­  
curred to tile end of tbe year, arid to leave a  
suiiill surplus for contingencies.  
They found, from a view of the future in­  
I come, consisting of the annuity and such rents  
tor buildings an may he reasonably required,  
that it would not be adequate to the full estab­  
| iishment of the ten professorships contemplated  
by the Legislature m ;.ieu- act of Jan. 25, I81‘J,  
lor establishing the University; but that it  
might su(Tice for instituting eight prufessor­  
j ships for the present, and that the hranche- of  
•S&#x27; tence proposed to be taught in the Uriv ars.ity,  
miglit be arranged within the competence lit  
that number for a time, and until future and  
favorable circumstances might enable them to  
add the, others, and to lighten duly the piofes­  
si&gt;r*liip3 thus over&#x27;chaiged with duties.  
They proceeded therefore to settle the or­  
[ ganiziliori of the schools, and the distribution  
of the sciences among them, and they conclu­  
ded on the Same as follows;  
III the University of Virginia shall be institu­  
ted eight professorships, to wit: 1. of Anlienl  
J j mgti’iges. 2. Mod.-i u Languages. Ma­  
thematics. 4. JSalui. t P-hilosojihy. 5. ^atu*  
lal History. C. Anatomy Jsc Medicine. 7. Mo

In the school of Aiiti« nt Languages nre to

letlr. 9, Anii. nl History &amp; Antlrnt Geography.  
In the school of Modern Languages are to  
be taught, French, Spanish, Italian, German,  
and liie K-.ghsli Language in its Anglo Saxon  
form, also Modern Hu,lory and Modern Geo­  
graphy.  
In ilie school rtf Mathematics arp to bp

In the school of Natural Philosophy ere to  
be taught the laws and properties wf bodies cc­  
m rally, including Mechanics, Static-., Hydro­  
statics, Hydraulics, Pneumatics, Acoustics,

Jo the school of Natural History are to be

In the school of Anatomy n„,j .Medicine are

macy.  
In the school of Moral Philosophy are tf&gt; j,0  
taught Mental Science generally, including  
Ideology, General Grammar and Ktiiics.  
In the school of L m, are to be taught the  
common and statute. Law, that of the Chan­  
try, the laws Feudal, Civil, Mercatorial, Ma­  
ritime, and of Nature and Nations, and’also,  
[ the principles of Government, and political e­  
conotny.  
But it wa* meant that this distribution should  
give way to occasional interchange* „f particu­  
lar branches of science among the professors  
in accommodation of their respective qualifi­  
cations.  
The Visitor* were sensible that there might  
be found in the different seminaries of the U.  
States, persons qualified lo conduct these sev­  
t-Tal ^livuls frith entire competence; but it  
  
was neither probate that they would leave (he  
situations in wliiclt they then were, nur limm -  
able or moral to endeavour to induce them  
Irom their station,*: and to hare filled ilia pro­  
fessional chairs w iih unemployed and second- I  
aiy characters, would not Have fulfilled the oh- I  
ject or satisfied the expectations «»r our conn­  
try in this institution. It was, moreover, lie- |  
lieved that to ndvanceiti science, no must a- i  
| v,jd ourselves of the lights of counti ies already  
i :**1***nccd before us. It was llieteloro deemed  
inost adv isalde to result to Kutiijie for some of  
the I*iofosaors, and of preference in the coun­  
tries which speak lliu same language, in order  
to obtain chaiacter* of the lir&amp;t grade of sri­  
! ,(iwe in their lespectivn lines; and to make the  
»• h ciion with proper inhumation, caution, and  
advisement, it was necessary to «eud an agent  
ni science mid confidence. Francis \V. tLl­  
mer, a learned and tru-d-woithy citizen of this  
state was appointed, and has proceeded oil the  
mission: and should his objects be accom­  
plished as early as expected, we count on u­  
pet.iiig the institution on the 1st Feb. next.  
Could the donation of l^ie last Legislature,  
out of the debt due to this State from the U.  
States, have been obtain&#x27; d for tbe purposes uf  
procuring a Library, and the appamtiis neces­  
sary (or the several schools, the opportunity  
wmild have been highly adv antageous of having  
I hem chosen l»y this agent, while in Europe&quot;  
with the advice and assistance of the respect­  
i*e professor?-. Hut the application was nut  
in lime to lie acted on before the adjournment  
• d&#x27;ih.! late Congress. Yet amne books were  
indispensable,and some ajipaialus to make u­  
veu an impeif.-ct commencement. To pro­  
cure these articles, therefore, and to defray  
tile expenses necessary for the other objects  
uf the mission, the board was under tin* tncea­  
si y of applying tin these purposes h sum of  
31U,5G0 of the annuity of the present year, and  
to leave tlie internal finishing of the Library,  
however much id he tegietteil, until Home op­  
portunity of greater convenience should occur.  
There is some reason In doubt, from the to  
formation received, whedier our agent will lie  
able to etlect his objects at as early a day as  
we had expected. But uf this, more will be  
known in time for its communication by the  
&#x27; Hector with ibis report. Were it still po«si­  
j ble to obtain Iroin the U. S. a settlement of so  
much of the claim no them as was appiupria­  
U-din ibis institution, in time to find our agent  
and FiofefSius yet in place to invest it, our  
University would open under auspices highly  
propitious, in comparison with those to which  
i&lt; w ill lie subjected by this unfortunate delay.  
Tile success of our Collector, in his applica­  
tions fur the arrearages due from subscribers,  
has not been as great as it lias been in further  
securing the sums which had not yet been se­  
cured. The receipts Iron) this resource, since

To the President and Directors of the Li.  
ttrary Fund,  
In obedience to me Jaw requiring that  
tthe Rector and Visitors of the University  
oil Virginia should make report annually  
- to the President and Directors ot the Lite­

ture at their next succeeding session j em*  
bracing a hid account ot the disbursements,  
I tfcie tunds in hand, and a general statement  
! oif the condition ot the Raid University,  
ti»e said Rector and Visitors make the  
following REPORT:  
in that of the preceding year it was stat­  
ed, that the buildings tor the accommoda­  
tion ol the Professors and students were in  
n*adinr ss for their occupation, and that the  
*1 alia ol tb§ larger building, inieuded fur  
  
a library, and other purposes, were completed.  
In tt?e course of the present season tui* build­  
ing has received its roof, and will be put into a  
condition for presen aiion and use, although its  
interior cannot be completed. It was then aUo  
stated, that without awaiting that completion,  
the institution might he p tinto operational  
the close of this present year, were its funds  
liberated from the incumbrances with which  
tbev werecnarged. This obstacle was re.nov.  
! cd by the act ot the legislature of January t7,  
of the present year, concerning the University  
of Virginia  
In consequence of this liber ation, the hoard  
of Visitors at their ensuing meeting, on the  
5th April last, proceeded to take such prepara­  
tot v measures as could be taken at that time,  
to carry the views ot the legislature into etiect  
with a* ittle delay a-* practicable. From tbe  
accounts and estimates then rendered bv the  
Bursar and Proctor, it appeared, that on the  
last ciav o! the preceding year, 1823, the fund*  
in hand, and due to the University of the last  
loan, and of the arreaiages of subscriptions,  
would be still cient, when received, to pay all  
debts then existing, on any account, and to  
leave a sum ot about v&gt;l I ,O0(J applicable to the  
buildingof tne library, which, with the sum  
of d19, J70 M) I 4 Already paid or provided for  
that edifice, would put it into a state of safety  
  
and or some uses uniii omcr uui mmc picking  
! objects should have bee.: accomplished I’hey  
considered the University, therefore, as having j  
had in hand, on the first dav of tne present |  
year, 1324, the annuity of this year, , clear of  
all prioi claims.) as a fund for defraying the  
current expenses of the year, for meeting those  
necessary towards procuring prole.-»-&gt;o:s, pay  
ing any commencement of salaries, which  
might he incurred to the end of the year, and  
to leave a small surplus lor contingencies  
Tnev found, from a view of the future in  
come consisting of the ann :ity and such  
rents for buildings as may be reasonably re. ;  
quired. that it wo Id not be adequate to the es. 1

plated by u»e legislaluie in their act of Jan 25,

it ini gut suffice or instituting eigut professor  
stops for the present, and that the branches of  
science proposed to he taught in the University  
might he arranged within the competence of  
that number for a time, and until future and  
favorable circumstances might enable them to  
| addthe others, and to lighten duly the proles.  
sorships thus overcharged with d- tv..  
| They proceeded thereiore, to settle the or  
ganization of the schools, and the distribution  
ol the sciences among them, and they con.  
eluded on the same as follows ;  
In the University of Virginia, shall be insti.  
toted eight professorships, to wit. I Of \n .  
cient Languages. 1. Modern Languages. 3. I  
Mathematics. 4. Natural Philosophy. 5. Na  
tural History. 6. Anatomy and Medicine. 7.  
Moral Philosophy. 8. Law.  
In the school of \ntient Languages are to

But it was meant that this distribution should  
give wav to occasio- al interchange of particu­

in accommodation ol their respective qualifi­  
cations, j  
I&#x27;he Visitors were sensible that there might  
he ound in the different Seminalies of the U. 1  
8 persons qualified to conduct these seveial .  
schools with entile competence, hut it was &lt;  
neither p ohable that thev would leave the sit- &lt; i  
nations in which they then were, nor honora |  
ble or moral to endeavor te seduce them from

a) chairs with unemployed and secondary ,  
characters would not have fulfilled the object j ^  
or satisfied the expectations of our co .&#x27;nil v i » i  
this Institution. It was moreover believed j  
that to advance in science, we muit av ail our |  
selves of the light of countries already advanc- j  
ed before us ; it was there.oie deemed most  
advisable to resort to L lope for some of the &#x27;  
professors, and of preference to the countries 1  
which speak the same language in older to r  
obtain characters of the fi st giade of science |  
in their respective lines ; and to make the se. (  
lection with p.oper informati n, « aution and  
advisement it was necessary to send an agent  
of science and confidence. Francis VV. Gil ^  
mer. a learned and trust worthy citizen of this  
8tate, was appoinle , and has proceeded on the &lt;  
mission ; and should his oljects be accorn i  
plished as easily as expected, tve count on o­  
pening the Institution on the 1st February

Could the donation of the last Legislature  
out of the debt due to this state from the L’ni* 1  
ted Stairs have been obtained for the purpose &lt;  
of procuring a lihiamry and the apparatus ne &lt;  
e ess ary for the several schools, the opportuni \
ty would have been highly ad antagenus of  
having them chasen by this agent, whilein Ku.  
rope, with the advice and assistance of the res.  
pertive professors. But the application was &lt;  
not in time to fe acted upon htfore the ad *  
journment of the late Congress V * t some &lt;  
books were indispensable, and some apparatus ,  
to make even an imperfect commencement —  
To procure these articles, therefore, and to de  
fray the expenses necessary for the other ob- ^  
jects of the mission, the hoard was under the  
necessity ol applying to those purposes a sum &lt;  
of ten thousand five hundred dollar s of toe an t  
nuity of the present year, and to leave the in ,  
ternal finishing of the librar y, however much  
to he regretted, until some opportunity of *  
greatei convenience should occur  
There is some reason to doubt, from the in. {

The success of our collector in his appli^a.

has not been as gr eat is it has been in further  
securing the sums which had not yet been iC

To Hit President and Directors of the  
J a ter ary Fund.  
In obedience to the law requiring that the  
Hector and Visitors of the University of Virgi­  
nia should mske report annually to the Presi­  
dent and Directors of the Literary Tuod. (to be  
lad before the legislature at their next sue­  
eeedi g session,) embracing a lull account i f  
tbe disbursements, the funds in band, and a  
j general .statement of the condition ot the said  
I Univeisity, the said Hector and Visitors make the  
: following UEf’OHTt .  
  
in uiai m me preceding year it was  
stated, that the buildings lor the accom­  
modation I r the Professors and students  
were in readiness for their occupation.!  
| and that the walls of the larger building,!  
| intended fora library, and other pur­  
1 poses, were comp eted. In the course  
of the present season this building lias  
received its roof, and will be put into a  
condition for preservation and use, al­  
though its interior cannot be completed.  
It wa-, then also stated, that without a­  
waifing that completion, the institution  
might be put into operation at the close  
of this present year, were its funds libe­  
rated irom the incumbrances with which  
they were charged. This obstacle was  
removed bv the act of the Legislature of  
, January 27, of the present year, con­  
cerning the University of Virginia.  
I In consequence of this liberation, the  
Board ol Visitors, at their ensuing meet­  
ing, on the 5th April last, proceeded to  
take such preparatory measures as could  
be taken at that time, to carry the views  
of the Legislature into effect with as lit­  
tle delay as practicable. From the ac­  
counts and estimates then rendered by  
the Bursar and Proctor, it appeared, that  
on the last day of the preceding year,  
1823, the funds in hand, and due to the  
University of the loan, and of the arrear­  
ages of subscriptions, would be sufficient  
when received, to pay all debts then ex­  
isting, on any account, and to leave a  
sum of about $21,000 applicable to the  
building of the libi ary, which, with the  
sum of $19,370 40j already paid or1  
provided, for that edifice, would put it  
into a state of safety and of some uses, i  
until other and more pressing objects  
shall have been accomplished.. They  
considered the University, therefore, as  
liavfng bad in hand, on the first day of  
the present j ear, 1821, the annuity of  
this year, (clear of all prior claims,) as ;  
a fund for defraying the current expen­  
ses of the year, for meeting those jic- !  
cessary towards procuring professor*. •  
paying any commencement of salaries,:  
which might he incurred to the end of the  
year, and to leave a small surplus lor  
contingencies.  
rI’i \ r _ _ * _ e ii t* a  
  
a. k&#x27;uuu, iii/iii u &gt; jr w vi tut: iuujic •  
income, consisting of the annuity, and  
and such rents for building* as may be  
reasonably required, that it would not ]  
be adequate to the establishment of the I  
ten professorships contemplated by the  
Legislature in their act of Jan. 25, 18W,  
for establishing the University, but that  
it might suffice lor instituting eight pro­  
fessorships for the present, and that the  
branches of science proposed to be taught  
in the University might be arranged with­  
in the competence of that number for a  
time, and until future, and favorable cir­  
cumstances might enable them to add the  
other, and to lighten duly the professor­  
ships thus overcharged with duties.  
They proceeded, therefore, to settle  
lire organization of the schools, and the  
distribution of the sciences among them,  
U they concluded on the same as follows:  
In the University of Virginia shall he  
instituted eight professorships, to wit:  
1. 01 Antient Languages. 2. Modern  
Languages. 3. Mathematics. 4, Na­  
tural Philosophy. 5. Natural History  
fi. Anatomy and Medicine. 7. Moral  
Philosophy. 8. Law.  
In the school of Antient Languages  
are to be taught the higher grade of the  
Latin and Greek Languages, the He­  
brew Rhetoric, Belles-lettres, Antient  
History, and Antient Geography.  
In the school of Modern Languages  
are to be taught French Spanish, Ital­  
ian* German, and the Knglisb language  
in its Anglo-Saxon form, also, Modern  
History and Modem Geography,  
4 ,  
  
In the shoo! of M* hematics are to  
be taught Mathematics generally. inclu­  
ding the higher branches of Noirenc*  
Arithmetic,Algebra,Trigonometry plane  
and spherical, Geometry, Mensuration,  
Navigation, Conic Sections, Fluxions  
or Ditfercutials, Military and Civil Ar­  
chitecture.  
In the school of Natural Philosophy  
are to he taught the laws and proper­  
ties o! bodies generally, including Me­  
chanics, Sutics, Hydrostatics, Hydraul­  
ics, Pneumatics, Acoustics, Optics, and  
A stronomy.  
In tlie school of Natural IJis?ory are*  
to be taught BotanV, Zoology, Minera­  
logy, Chemistry, Geology, and Rurat  
Economy.  
In the school Anatomy and medicine  
arc to be taught Anatomy, Surgery, the  
history of the progress and theories of  
Medicine, Physiology, Pathology, Ma­  
teria Medina, nod Pharmacy.  
In the school ol Moral Philosophy arm  
to be taught Mental Nciencc generally  
including Ideology, general Grammer  
and Ethics.  
In the school of Law are to be taught*  
the Common and Statute Law, that of  
the Ctiancery, the Laws Feudal, Civil,  
Mercatotial, Maritime and of Nature  
and Nations, and also the Principles of  
Government and Political Economy.  
  
win ii iimmiu uiai mh utsn itMiUmv  
should give vrny to occasional interchan­  
ge* yt&#x27;puriicular branches ol science n— i  
mong the Professors, in accommodation  
of their respective qualifications.  
The Visitors were sensible that there  
might be found in (he diflereut Semina­  
ries of the tJ. 8. persons qualified to  
conduct these several school* with en­  
tire competence, but it was neither pro­  
bable that they would leave the situa­  
tions in which they then were, nor ho­  
norable or moral to endeavor to seduc*  
them from their stations; and to hav«  
tilled the Professional Chairs with un­  
employed and secondary characters,  
would not have fulfilled the object or  
satisfied the expectations of our coun­  
try in this Institution. It was moreover *  
believed that to advance in science, w o  
must avail ourselves of the light oi *  
countries already advanced before us;  
it was therefore deemed most advisable  
to^resort to Europe for some of the Pro- .  
lessors, and of preference to the coun- *  
tries which speak the same language ia  
order to obtain diameters of the first  
grade of science in their respective lines^  
and to make the selections with proper*  
information, caution and advisement, it  
was necessary to send an agent of&#x27;  
science and confidence. Francis VV.  
Gilmer, a learned and trust-worthy citi­  
zen of this State, was appointed, and has  
proceeded on the mission; and should,  
his objects be accomplished as easily as.  
expected, we count on opening the In­  
stitution on the 1st February next.  
C’ould the donation of the last Legis­  
lature out of the debt due to this Stada  
from the U. 8. have been obtained for *  
the purpose of procuring a Library and  
the Apparatus necessary for the several  
schools, the opportunity would have  
been highly advantageous of having  
them chosen by this agent, while in Eu- &lt;■  
rope, with the advice and assistance of  
the respective Professors. But the ap­  
plication was not in time to ,be acted on&#x27;  
before the adjournment of the late Con-,  
gress. let some books were indispen­  
sable,’and some apparatus to make cveiii  
an imperfect commencement. To pro­  
cure these articles therefore, and to de-,  
fray the expenses necessary for the other*  
objects of the mission, the Board wat  
under the necessity of applying tothos®.  
  
jiuijvc/oco a, sum ui itn wioTjsami nvifc  
hundred dollars, of the annuity of th%,  
present year, and to leave the internal  
finishing oi the Library, however much  
fo be regretted, until some opportunity  
of greater convenienpe should occur.  
There is rio reason to doubt, fronx  
the information received, whether, oup  
agent will be able to effect his objects  
at as early a day as we had expected.  
Rut of this more will be known in time  
for its communication by the Hector  
with this Report. Were it still possible  
to obtain from the U. S. a settlement ol  
so much of the claim on them as waa  
appropriated to this Institution, in time  
to find our Agent and Professors yet in  
place to invest it, our University would  
open under auspices highly propitious

In that of till&#x27; preceding year it was sta

in readiness for tlleir occupation, and that

son tliis building has received Us loof. and  
will he put into a condition for pieservatinu  
and use, although its interior cannot he  
eompleted. It was then al«o staled, that,  
without aw aiting that completion, the insti  
tution might lie put into operation at the  
close of this present year, were its funds  
liheratt d from the iucumhraMces w itli vv hu ll  
they were charged. This obstacle w as re­  
mo led hy the at I uf I he I legislature of Jan.  
27, of the present year, concerning the U*  
niversity of \ irgiitia.  
In coii&#x27;uopience of this liberation, the  
Hoard of \ isitors, at their ensuing meeting  
on the Oil) of April last, proceeded to take  
such preparatory measures as could lie ta­  
ken at that time, to r-airy the views uf the  
Legislature into effect willi ng little delay  
as practicable. Vroill the account and es­  
timates then rendered hy the llursar and  
I&#x27;roctor, it appeared that mi the la*t da)

to pay all debts then existing on any ac­  
count, and to leave a ship of about 521,000  
applicable tn the building of the Library ;  
whiih, wilii the sum of 519.970 40-J alrea  
dy paid, or provided for that edifice, would  
put it into a state uf safety and of some  
uses, until other and more-pressing objects  
should have hern accomplished. They  
eonsitlered |the University, therefore, as  
having had in hand on the. first day of the

(clear of all prior claims) as a fond for de­  
fraying the current expenses of the year  
for meeting those necessary towards  
procuring Professors, paying any com­  
mencement of salaries, which miglit lie in  
curled to the end of the year, and to leave  
a small surplus for contingencies.  
They found, from a view of the future in­  
come, donsisti&#x27;tg of tile annuity nut such  
Tents fur buildings as may he reasonably  
required, that it would nut he adequate tn  
the full establishment of the ten professor­  
ships contemplated by tile Legislature in  
their art of Jan. 85, 1819, fur establishing  
the University ; hut that it might sidtrce  
for instituting eight professorships for the

proposed to lie taught in the Universi&#x27;

To the president and directors of the literary fund.  
  
In obedience to the law requiring that the rector  
and visitors of the university of Virginia should  
make report annually to the president and directors  
of the literary fund, (to be laid before the legislature  
at their next succeeding session), embracing a. full  
account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and  
a general statement of the condition of the said uni-  
versity, the said rector and visitors make the follow-  
ing REPORT:  
  
In that of the preceding year it was stated that  
the buildings, for the accommodation of the profes-  
sors and students, were in readiness for their occupa-  
tion, and that the walls of the larger building, intend-  
ed for a library andother purposes, were completed.  
In the course of the present session this building has  
received its roof, and will be put into a condition for  
preservation and use, although its interior cannot be  
completed. It was then also stated, that, without  
awaiting that completion, the institution might be  
put into operation at the close of this present year,  
were its funds liberated from the incumbrances with  
which they were charged. This obstacle was remov-  
ed by the act of the legislature of January 27, of the  
present year, concerning the university of Virginia.  
  
In consequence of this liberation, the board of visi-  
tors, at their ensuing meeting on the 5th of April last,  
proceeded to take such preparatory measures as could  
be taken at that time, to carry the views of the legis-  
lature into effect with as little delay as practicable.  
From the accounts and estimates then rendered by  
the bursar and proctor, it appeared that, on the  
last day of the preceding year, 1823, the funds in  
hand and due to theuniversity, of the last lean, and  
of the arrearages of subscriptions, would be sufficient,  
when received, to pay all debts then existing on any  
account, and to leave a sum of about $21,000, appli-  
cable to the building of the library; which, with the  
sum of $19,370 404, already paid or provided for that  
edifice, would put it into a state of safety and of some  
uses, until other and more pressing objects should  
have been accomplished. ‘They considered the uni-  
versity, therefore, as having had in hand, on the first  
day of the present year, 1824, the annuity of this  
year, (clear ofall prior claims), as a fund for defray-  
‘ug the current expenses of the year, for meeting  
those necessary towards procuring professors, paying  
  
curred to the end of the year, and to leavea small  
surplus for contingencies.  
  
_ They found, froma view of the fature income, con-  
sisting of the annuity and such rents for buildings as  
may be reasonably required, that it would not be ade-  
quate to the full establishment of the ten professor-  
ships contemplated by the legislature in their act of  
January 25,1819, for establishing the university; but  
that it might suffice for instituting eight professorships  
for the present, and that the branches of sciences  
proposed to be taught in the university, might be ar-  
ranged within the competence of that number fora  
time, and until future and favorable circumstances  
might enable them to add the others, and to lighten  
duly the professorships thus overcharged with duties.  
They proceeded, therefore, tosettle the organization  
of the schools, and the distribution of the sciences  
mens them, and they concluded on the same as fol-  
ows:  
  
In the university of Virginia shall be instituted  
eight professorships, to wit: 1. Of ancient languages.  
  
2. Modern languages. 3. Mathematics. 4. Natural  
philosophy. 5. Natural history. 6. Anatomy and  
medicine. 7%. Moral philosophy. 8. Law.  
  
In the school of the ancicnt languages are to be  
taught the higher grade of the Latin and Greek lan-  
guages, the Hebrew. rhetoric, belles lettres, ancient  
history and ancient geography.  
  
In the school of modern languages, are to be taught  
French, Spanish, Italian, German, and the English  
language in its Anglo-Saxon form, also modern hista-  
ry and modern geography.  
  
In the school of mathematics are to be taught ma-  
thematics generally, including the higher branches of  
numerical arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, plane  
and spherical; geometry, mensuration, navigation,  
conic sections, fluxions or differentials, military and  
civil architecture.  
  
In the school of natural philosophy, are to be taught  
the laws and properties of bodies generally, incl:d-  
ing mechanics, statics, hydrostatics, hydraulics,  
pneumatics, acoustics, optics and astronomy.  
  
In the school of natural history, are to be taught  
botany, zoology, mineralogy, chemistry, geology and  
rural economy.  
  
In the schoolof anatomy and medicine, are to be  
taught anatomy, surgery, the history of the progress  
and theories of medicine, physiology, pathology, ma-  
teria medica, and pharmacy.  
  
In the school of moral philosophy, are to be taught  
mental science generally, including ideology, general  
graminar and ethics.  
  
In the school of law, are to be taught the common  
and statute law, that of the chancery, the laws, feudal,  
civil, mercatorial, maritime, and of nature and na-  
tions, and also the principles of government, and  
political economy.  
  
But it was meant that this distribution should give  
way to occasional interchanges of particular branches  
of science among the professors, in accommodation  
of their respective qualifications.  
  
The visitors were sensible that there might be  
found, in the different seminaries of the United States,  
persons qualified to conduct these several schools  
with entire competence; but it was neither probable  
that they would leave the situations in which they  
then were, nor honorable or moral to endeavor to se-  
duce them from their stations: and to have filled the  
professional chairs with unemployed and secondary  
characters, would not have fulfilled the object or satis-  
fied the expectations of our country in this institution.  
It was, moreover, believed that to advance in science,  
we must avail ourselves of the lights of countries al-  
ready advanced before us. It was, therefore, deem-  
ed most advisable to resort to Europe for some of  
the professors, and, of preference, to the countries

eharacters of the first grade of science in their re- |  
spective lines; and to make the selection with pro-  
per information, caution and advisement, it was ne-  
fessary to send an agent of science and confidence,  
Francis W. Gilmer, alearned and trust-wovthy citi-  
zen of this state, was appointed, and has proceeded  
on the mission, and should his objects be accomplish-  
ed as early as cxpected, we count on opening the in-  
Stitution on the Ist February next.  
  
Conld the donation of the last legislature, ont of  
the d&amp;bt dué to this state from the United States,  
have beon obtained for the purposes of procuring a  
  
hbrary, and the apparatus necessary for the several |  
  
schools, the opportunity would have been highly ad-  
vantageous of having them chosen by this agent,  
While in Europe’, with the advice and assistance of  
the respective professors. Bunt the application was  
hot in time to be acted on before the adjournment of  
the late congress. Yetsome books were indispensa-  
ble, and some apparatus to make even an imperfect  
rommencement. To procure these articles, there-  
fore, and to detray the expenses necessary for the  
other objects of the mission, the board was under the  
necessity of apnlying to these purposes a sum of  
$10,500 of the annuity of the present year, and to  
leave the internal finshing of the library, however  
much to be regreted, until some opportunity of greui-  
er convenience should ocenr.  
  
There is some reason to doubt, from the informa-  
tion received, whether our agent will be able to effect  
his objects at as curly a day as we had expected.  
Putof this, more willbe known in time for its com-  
munication by the rector with this report. Were it  
still possible to obtain from the United States a set-  
tiement of so much of the claim on them as was ap-  
propriated to this institution, in time to find our  
agent and professors yet in a place to invest it, our uni-  
versity would open under auspices highly propitious,  
in comparison with theseto which it will be subject-  
ed b; this unfortunate delay.  
  
The success of our collector, in his applications  
for the arrearages due from subscribers, has not}  
been as creat as it has been in further securing the  
sums Which had not yet been secured. The receipts }  
from this resource, since the date of our last report, !  
have amounted to $2,069 881, and the sums deemed |  
separate and still to be received, amount to $7,465 924. |  
  
The accounts of the receipts, disbursements, and |  
funds on hand, for the year, ending with the last}  
month of September, as rendered by the bursar and |  
proctor, are given with this report, as is required by |  
law. THOS. JEFFERSON, Rector.

art of the Legislature ot January L’7, of  
the present year, concerning the Universi­  
ty of Virginia.

Board of Visitors, at th ir ensuing meet­  
ing on the 5th of April last, proceeded to  
take such preparatory measures as could  
be taken at that time, to carry the views  
of the Legislature into effect with as little  
delay as practicable. From the accounts  
and estimates then rendered by the Bur  
sar and Proctor, it appeared that on the  
last day ol the preceding year 1823, (Ik  
binds in Lind, and due to the University,  
of the last loan, and of the arrearages ot  
subscriptions, would be sufficient, when  
received, to pay all debts then existing on  
any account, and to leave a sum of about  
•&gt;’l,000, applicable to the building of th.*  
Library; which, with the sum of $19,37»  
40 t-2 already paid, or provided for that  
edifice, would put it into a state of safety  
and of some uses, until other and more  
pressing objects should have been accom­  
plished. They considered the University,  
therefore, as having had in hand on the  
first day of the present year, 1824, the an­  
nuity of this year (clear of all prior claims)  
as a fund for defraying the current ex­  
penses of the year, for meeting those ne­  
cessary towards procuring Professors, pav­  
ing any commencement of salaries, which  
might be incurred to the end of the year,  
and to leave a small surplus for contin­  
gencies.  
  
I hey lound, from a view ol the future  
income, consisting of the annuity and such  
rents for buildings as may be reasonably  
required, that it would not be adequate to  
the full establishment of the ton profes­  
sorships contemplated by the Legislature  
in their act of January Zb, 1819, for es­  
tablishing the University; but that it might  
suffice for instituting eight professorships  
for the present,, anti that the branches of  
science proposed to be taught in the Uni­  
versity, might be arranged within the com­  
petence’of that number for a time, and  
until future and favorable circumstances  
might enable them to adu the others, and  
to lighten duly the professorships thus  
overcharged with duties.  
They proceeded therefore to settle the  
organization of the schools, and the dis­  
tribution of the sciences among them, and  
they concluded on the same as follows;  
In the University of Virginia shall be  
instituted eight professorships, to wit; 1.  
of Antient Languages. 2. Modern Lan­  
guages. 3. Mathematics. 4. Natural  
Philosophy. 5. Natural History. 0.  
Anatomy and Medicine. 7. Moral Philo­  
sophy. 8. Law.  
In the school of Antient Languages are  
to be taught the higher grade of the Latin  
and Greek languages, the Hebrew, Rhe­  
toric, Belles-lettres, Antient History and  
Antient Geography.  
in the school of Modern Languages are  
to be taught. French, Spanish, Italian, Ger­  
  
man, and tlie English Language in its  
Anglo Saxon form, also Modern History  
and Modern Geography.  
In the school ot Mathematics are to be  
taught Mathematics generally, including  
the higher branches of Numerical Arith­  
metic, Algebra, Trigonometry Mane and  
Spherical, Geometry, Mensuration, Navi­  
gation, t onic Sections, Fluxions or Diffe­  
rentials, Military and Civil Architecture.  
In the school of Natural Philosophy are  
to be taught the laws and properties of bo­  
dies generally, including Mechanics Statics,  
Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Pneumatics, A­  
coustics, Optics, and Astronomy.  
In the school of Natural History are to  
be taught Botany, &#x27;/.oology, Mineralogy,  
Chemistry, Geology and Rural LcouemV.  
In the school of Anatomy and Medicine  
are to be taught Anatomy, Surgery, tlie  
history of the progress and theories of  
Medicine, Physiology , Pathology, Materia  
Medica, and Pharmacy.  
In the school of Moral Philosophy arc  
to be taught Mental Science gencrallv in­  
cluding Ideology, General Grammar and  
Ethics.  
  
In the school ol Law, are to be taught  
the common ami statute Law, that ol the  
Chancery, the laws Feudal, Civil, Murca­  
torial, Maritime, and ui Nature and Na­  
tions, and also, the principles of Govern­  
ment, and political economy.  
Cut it was meant that this distr.bution  
should give way to occasional interchang­  
es ol particulor branches ot science among  
the professois, in accommodation of their  
respective qualifications.  
The Visitors were sensible that there  
might be found in the different seminaries  
ot the Lnited States, persons qualified to  
conduct these several schools with entire  
competence; bm it was neither probable  
that they would leave the situations in  
which they then were, nor honorable or  
moral to endeavor to seduce them from  
their stations : and to have filled the pro­  
visional chairs with unemployed and se­  
condary characters, would not have fulfil­  
led the object or satisfied the expectations  
of our country in this institution. It was,  
moreover, believed tligt to advance in  
science, we must avail ourselves of the  
• iiihts of countries already advanced be­  
fore us. It was therefore deemed most  
ad\isable to resort to Europe for some of  
the Professors, and of preference to the  
countries which speak the same language,  
in order to obtain characters of the first  
grade of science in their respective lines ;  
and to make the selecton Vhh proper in­  
formation, caution, and advisement, it was  
necessary to send an agi nt ot science and  
confidence. 1Tancis W. Giiiner, a learn­  
ed and trust-worthy citizen of this state  
was appointed, and has proceeded on the  
mission: and should his objects be accom­  
plished as early as expected, we count on  
opening the institution on the 1st Februa­  
ry next.  
  
boiihi the donation of the last Legisla­  
ture, out of the debt due to this State from  
the United States, have been obtained for  
th&lt;* purpose of procuring a Library, and  
the apparatus necessary for the several  
schools, the opportunity would have been  
highly advantageous of having them cho­  
sen by this agent, while in Lurope, with  
the advice and assistance of the respective  
professors. But the application was not  
in time to be acted on before the adjourn­  
ment of the late Congress. Yet some  
books were indispensable, and some ap­  
paratus to make even an imperfect com­  
mencement. To procure these articles,  
and to defray the expenses necessary for  
the other objects of the mission, the board  
was under the necessity of applying to  
these purposes a sum of £ 10,300 of&#x27;the  
annuity of the present year, and to leave  
the internal finishing of the Library, how­  
ever much to be regretted, until some op­  
portunity of greater convenience should  
occur.  
There is some reason to doubt, from  
the information received, whether our  
agent will be able to effect his objects at as  
early a Hay as we had expected. But of  
this, more will be known in time for its  
communication by the Rector with this re­  
port. Were it still possible to obtain from  
the United States a settlement of so much  
of the claim on them as was appropriated  
to this institution, in time to find our agent  
and Professors yet in place to invest it,  
our University would open under auspices  
highly propitious, in comparison with those  
to which it will be subjected by this un­  
fortunate delav.  
The success of our Collector, in his ap­  
plications fur the arrearages due from sub­  
scribers, has not been as great as it has  
been in further securing the sums which  
had not yet been secured. The receipts
