termine the Law, you may do it, but you must be very sure that you determine, according to Law, for it touches your Consciences, and you Act at your Peril.” Lord Mansfield in Baldwins Case. Junius to Lord M.  
3 Black. 378. “The Jury may, if they think proper, take upon themselves to determine at their own hazard, the complicated Question of fact and Law; and without either Special Verdict or Special Case may find a Verdict absolutely, either for Plaintiff or Defendant. Vid. page .”  
5. Bac. Abr. 285. 286. relating to general and Special Verdicts.  
1. Inst. 228. a. Littleton §368. “Also in such Case where the Enquest may give their Verdict at large, if they will take upon them the Knowledge of the Law, upon the Matter, they may give their Verdict generally, as is put in their Charge; as in the Case aforesaid they may well say, that the Lessor did not disseise the Lessee, if they will &amp;c.” Note. “Altho the Jurie, if they will take upon them (as Littleton here saith) the Knowledge of the Law, may give a general Verdict, yet it is dangerous for them so to do, for if they mistake the Law, they run into the Danger of an Attaint, therefore to find the Special Matter, is the safest Way, where the Case is doubtfull.”  
4. Rep. 53. b. Rawlins Case. 29–30. Eliz. B.R. “And in such Case the Jury ought, if they will, not find the Special matter, and leave it to the Judgment of the Law, to find it at their Peril according to Law.”

 Tryal of the Indictment the Judge directs the Jury thus ’if you believe such and such Witnesses, who have sworn such and such Facts, the Killing the deceased was with Malice prepense express, or it was with Malice implied, and then you ought to find the Prisoner guilty of Murder; but if you do not believe those Witnesses, then you ought to find him guilty of Manslaughter only.’”  
Foster. 255. “In every Case where the Point turneth upon the Question, whether the Homicide was committed willfully and maliciously, or under Circumstances justifying, Excusing, or alleviating; the Matter of Fact, vizt., whether the Facts alledged by Way of Justification, Excuse, or Alleviation are true, is the proper and only Province of the Jury. But whether upon a Supposition of the Truth of Facts such Homicide be justified, excused, or alleviated must be submitted to the Judgment of the Court. For the Construction the Law putteth upon Facts stated and agreed or found by a Jury is, in this, as in all other Cases, undoubtedly the Proper Province of the Court. In Cases of Doubt and real Difficulty it is commonly recommended to the Jury to state Facts and Circumstances in a Special Verdict. But when the Law is clear, the Jury under the Direction of the Court in Point of Law, Matters of Fact being still left to their Determination, may, and if they are well advised always will find a general Verdict conformable to such Direction. Ad Quaestionem Juris non respondent Juratores.”  
1 Burrows 393. Bright Exr. vs. Eynon. Lord Mansfield, “Tryals by Jury, in civil Causes could not subsist now, without a Power somewhere, to grant new Tryals, &amp;c. &amp;c. If an erroneous Judgment be given in Point of Law, there are many Ways to review and set it right. Where a Court judges of Fact upon Depositions in Writing, their Sentence or Decree may, many Ways, be reviewed and set right.  
“But a general Verdict can only be set right by a new Tryal,” &amp;c. “The Writ of Attaint is now a mere Sound, in every Case: in many, it does not pretend to be a Remedy.”  
Vid. page 3 of this Statute.  
Holt. Rep. 702. Argent vs. Darrell. Holt. “We must not make ourselves absolute Judges of Law and fact to

Holt 703. 704. Gay vs. Cross. A general Verdict, and Jury would give no Reason for it. Holt said, “he never had known the like, and that he would have but little regard for the Verdict of a Jury on a Tryal that would not at a Judges desire declare the Reasons which had induced them to give it; for as the Judges of the Courts do publickly declare the Reasons of their Judgments and thereby expose themselves to the Censure of all that be learned in the Law; yet there is no Law obliges them to it, but it is for public Satisfaction. So the Jury ought likewise” when requir’d by the Court to make known the Reasons but the Court would not grant a new trial tho

inal contrary to the Evidence: and that it would be inconsistent with the Principles of Liberty to permit the Crown (when it might intend oppression) to call in Question a Verdict of Acquittal. Since that glorious aera the Revolution, the Kings of England have only prosecuted as Patriae Patrise when punishment hath been necessary for the safety of the whole; but when we look into Tryals during preceeding Reigns, we cannot but revere the wise and noble Constitution established by our Ancestors against the vindictive Prosecution of a Plantaganet and a Stewart.”  
Common Law.  
Black. 63. bott. “But, with us at present, The Monuments and Evidences of our legal Customs, are contained in the Records of the several Courts of Justice, in Books of Reports, and judicial Decisions and in the Treatises of learned Sages of the Profession, preserved and handed down to us, from the Times of highest antiquity.” Page 73. “And thus much for the 1st. ground and chief corner Stone of the Laws of England, which is, general immemorial Custom, or common Law from Time to Time declared in the Decisions of the Courts of Justice; which Decisions are preserved among our public Records, explained in our Reports and digested for general Use, in the Authoritative Writings of the venerable Sages of the Law.”  
Question 1st. “Does the Opinion mean to declare, that upon the general Issue of Not Guilty, in the Case of a seditious Libel, the Jury have no Right by Law to examine the Innocence or Criminality of the Paper, if they think fit, and to form their Verdict with such Examination?  
“2. Does the Opinion mean to declare, that in the Case above mentioned, when the Jury have delivered in their Verdict, Guilty, that this Verdict has found the Fact only, and not the Law?  
  
“3. It is to be understood by this Opinion, that if the Jury come to the Bar, and say, that they find the printing and publishing, but that the Paper is no Libel, that in that Case the Jury have found the Defendant, guilty, generally and that the Verdict must be so entered up?  
“4. Whether the Opinion means to say, that if the Judge, after giving his Opinion of the Innocence or Criminality of the Paper, should leave the Consideration of that matter, together with the printing and publishing, to the Jury, such a Direction would be contrary to Law?  
“5. I beg Leave to ask, whether dead and living Judges, then absent, did declare their Opinions in open Court, and whether the noble L—d has any Note of such opinions?  
“6. Whether they declared such Opinions, after solemn Arguments, or upon any Point judicially before them?”  
Questions put by Lord C——n to Lord M——d in answer to a Paper his Lordship left with the Clerk of the Room the day before. M——d refused to answer these Questions, saying he would not answer interrogatories. Newspaper.  
4. Blackstone 354 “But An open Verdict may be either general, guilty, or not guilty; or Special, setting forth all the Circumstances of the Case, and praying the Judgment of the Court, whether for Instance, on the Facts stated, it be murder, Manslaughter, or no Crime at all. This is where they doubt the matter of Law, and therefore chuse to leave it to the determination of the Court; though they have an unquestionable Right of determining upon all the Circumstances, and finding a general Verdict, if they think proper so to hazard a Breach of their Oaths: and, if their Verdict be notoriously wrong, they may be punished and the Verdict set Aside by Attaint at the Suit of the King; but not at the Suit of the Prisoner, 2. H.P.C. 310. But the Practice, heretofore in Use of fining, imprisoning, or otherwise punishing Juries merely at the discretion of the Court, for finding their Verdict, contrary to the direction of the Judge, was arbitrary, unconstitutional, and illegal: and is treated as such by Sir Thomas Smith, 200 Years ago; who ’accounted such doings to be very violent, tyrannical, and contrary to the Liberty and Custom of the Realm of England.’ For as Sir Mathew Hale well observes 2. H.P.C. 313 ’it would be a most unhappy Case, for the Judge himself, if the Prisoners Fate depended upon his Directions: unhappy also for the Prisoner; for, if the Judges opinion must rule the Verdict, the Tryal by Jury would be useless.’ Yet in many Instances, 1 Lev. 9, T. Jones 163, St. tr. 10. 416, where contrary to Evidence the Jury have found the Prisoner guilty, their Verdict hath been mercifully set aside, and a new Tryal granted by the Court of Kings Bench: for in such Case as hath been said, it cannot be set right by Attaint. But there hath yet been no Instance of granting a new Tryal, where the Prisoner was acquitted upon the first. 2. Hawk. 442.”

of law, and therefore chuse to leave it to the determination of the  
court; though they have an unquestionable right of determining  
upon all the circamstances, and finding a geneial verdict, if they  
think proper so tohazard a breach of their oaths ; and, if their verdict be  
notoriously wrong, they may be punished, aud the verdict set aside by  
attaint at the suit of the king; but not at the suit of the prisoner. Bat  
the practice, heretofore in use, of fining, imprisouing, or otherwise pu-  
nishing jurots, merely at the discretion of the court, for finding their  
verdict contrary to the direction of the judge, was arbitrary, uncoustitu-  
tional, and illegal; and is treated as such by Sir Thomas Smith, two  
hundred years ago; who accounted “such doings to be very violent,  
tyrannical, and contrary to the liberty and custom of the realm of Eng-  
land.” For, as Sir Mathew Hale well observes, it would be a most  
unhappy case for the judge himself, if the prisoner’s fate depended

that it is or is not disseisin, their verdict shall be admitted at  
their own peril.” 1 Statutes of the Realm, 86. That statute,  
as Lord Coke tells us, was declaratory of the common law;  
and before its enactment some justices directed juries to  
return general verdicts, thus subjecting them to the peril of  
an attaint if they mistook the law. 2 Inst. 422, 425.  
  
Littleton, speaking of civil actions in which the jury, upon  
the general issue pleaded, might return a special verdict, says  
that “if they will take upon them the knowledge of the law  
upon the matter, they may give their verdict generally, as is  
put in their charge.” Lit: § 368. And accordingly Lord  
Coke says: “ Although the jury, if they will take upon them  
(as Littleton here saith) the knowledge of the law, may give  
a general verdict, yet it is dangerous for them so to do, for  
if they do mistake the law, they run into the danger of an  
attaint; therefore to find the special verdict is the safest  
where the case is doubtful.” Co. Lit. 227 6.  
  
Lord Coke elsewhere says that “the jury ought, if they  
will not find the special matter, to find ‘at their peril’ accord-  
ing to law.” awlyns’s case, 4 Rep. 52a,536. And Lord
