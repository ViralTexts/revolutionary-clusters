I make no apology for the liberty I take of addressing a letter to you. Being a Virginian by nature, habit  
and character yourself, you will readily I am sure appreciate the feelings of one of her sons in surrendering to you the  
commission it was so much my honor and pride to receive from you: I was of course first commissioned as a midshipman and  
served with diligence and faithfulness until I received from you the appointment of a lieutenancy in the Navy of the  
United States; the duties of which I have in like manner discharged with all the ardor and integrity consonant with a man  
who has always loved his country, government and people. It has altogether occupied a period of twenty three years, ten or  
twelve of which have been consumed in the most active service. I have never disgraced the flag or character of my country  
in any shape, way or degree whatever; but I have uniformly sustained the dignity and honor of both, amid many arduous and  
very perilous engagements: It was my good fortune to be with Commodore Decatur in the Ship United States in the  
engagement with the British ship (captured) Macedonian 38. I was with him in a boat fight off New London and rescued a  
valuable vessel and cargo from under the guns of the enemy’s squadron, which was beleived to be one of the most hazardous  
enterprises. I was with him in the United States Frigate President with the British squadron, consisting of the Majestic  
74, the Endimion 44 frigate, the Tenedos frigate 38, the Pomona 38 and a Sloop of war—the engagement  
commencing at day light in the morning, and lasting until 11 O’Clock P. M. I was with him in the frigate Guerrier  
against the Algerine admiral and frigate Medora in the Mediterranean and captured her, which led to the treaty between  
Algiers and the United States; and on the next day, captured an Algerine Sloop of war 22 Guns. And, finally, when taken  
prisoner in the frigate President by the British squadron before mentioned and carried to Bermuda, in consequence of  
reflections made upon the U. S. government and Com: Decatur, I was selected by my brother officers to chastise the editor  
of the King’s press; which I fully accomplished on the King’s square, at the hazard of being sent to England or  
imprisoned in the Island.  
I have cruized in every sea and almost every latitude of the globe, and have always sustained the reputation  
of an officer devoted to his country’s service. It becomes now, after all those trying circumstances (for which every  
degree of character has been faithfully awarded to me by my superiors and comrades,) to be under the necessity of  
restoring to you the commission that it was your prerogative to give, and my honor to receive from you, as president of  
the United States. I return it to you, Sir, because I deem you so perfectly worthy of the respect which it is my view to  
pay you by the surrender of it: you worthily bestowed it upon me, and I have most conscientiously and faithfully fulfilled  
the obligations it imposed upon me.  
Driven from any further service to my country by the most wretched injustice and by a spirit of persecution  
and gross tyranny unparalelled in the annals of the country, it is my province to assure you, tho’ dismissed myself from  
the Navy, it would be to me at least a comfortable reflection, if I could imagine that there is any thing like even the  
possibility of justice to be calculated upon, under the existing miserable administration, to those it has been so long my  
pride and blessing to have been associated with in the Navy of the U. S. I owe it however to truth and justice to say;  
that the link which holds them together is just as feeble and brittle in their hands, as mine has been: fidelity, arduous  
service and valor, are not now a days, such attributes as to weigh a feather in the scale with power and interest.  
I consider the administration of Andrew Jackson as subversive of constiutional liberty at least; and utterly  
guided by feeling and passion; and altho my degredation and ruin have been long ago plotted by his malicious, invidious  
and utterly dishonest official subalterns, it has been his pride to connive at it all, and to make me the victim of their  
base and heartless injustice. I have the honor to be With profound respect Your most Obdn. Servant

Dear Sir—I make no apology for the

Being a Virginian by nature, habit and  
character yourself, you will readily, I am  
sure, appreciate the feelings one of her  
sons in surrendering to you the conmiis  
•ion, it was so much my honor and piide toj

appointed a midshipman, and served with

from you the commission of a lieutenancy  
in the Navy of tlu United States, the du  
ties which I have in like manner discharged

dignity and honor of both, amid manyj  
arduous and very peiilous engagements.;

Sequence of reflections made upon the U

it is my province to assure you, though

tie in their hands, as mine lias been:—fi  
delity, arduous service and valor, are not,  
now a days, such attributes as to weigh

which was captured. I was with him in a  
boat fight off New-Lnndon, and rescued a  
valuable vessel and cargo from under the  
guns of the enemy’s squadron, which w as be­  
lieved to be one of the most hazardous enter­  
prises. I was with him in the United States’  
frigate President, in an engagement with the  
British Squadron, consisting of the Majestic  
74, the Endymion 44 frigate, Tenedos frigate  
38, the Pomona 38, and a sloop of war; the  
engagement commencing at daylight in the  
morning, and lasting until 11 o’clock, P. M.  
I was with him in the frigate Gucrriere  
against the Algerine frigate Medora, in the  
Mediterranean, which was captured, and  
which led to the treaty between Algiers and  
the United States, and on the next day cap­  
tured an Algerine sloop of war of 22 guns.—  
And finally, when taken prisoner, in the frig­  
ate President, by the British squadron before  
mentioned, and carried to Bermuda, in conse­  
quence of reflections made upon the United  
States Government and Com. Decatur, I was  
selected by my brother officers to chastise the  
editor of the King’s press, which I fully ac­  
complished on the King’s square, at the haz­  
ard of being sent to England or imprisoned  
on the Island. I have cruised in every sea  
and almost every latitude of the globe, and  
hare always sustained the reputation of an of­  
ficer devoted to his country&#x27;s service.
