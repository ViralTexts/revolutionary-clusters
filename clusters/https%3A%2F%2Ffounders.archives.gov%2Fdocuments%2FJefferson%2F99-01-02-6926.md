7 December 1807  
  
We learn that our government recieved no letters from mr Monroe by the British packet lately arrived.   It was  
before known that on the 7th. of Sep. mr Monroe addressed a note to mr Canning in consequence of his instructions by the  
Revenge complaining of the aggression on the Chesapeake, calling on that government for reparation of the wrong and for a  
final discussion &amp; understanding on their claim to take whomsoever they chuse to call their seamen, wherever found; &amp;  
assuring him at the same time that he was authorised to concur in arrangements liberally calculated to take away all  
ground for that practice.   It is now rumored that the answer was that by the President’s proclamation we had taken the  
business of satisfaction for the aggression on the Chesapeake sofar into our own hands; that still however the British  
government was ready to enter into a discussion of that act, if it could be done separately, leaving their general claim  
to future negociation: but that as mr Monroe considered himself unauthorised to settle this act separately, that  
government would enter with him into no explanations concerning it, but would send a minister to this place for that  
special purpose. Whether this is a mere maneuvre to avoid a settlement, &amp; lose the subject altogether in the endless  
mazes of negociation, is to be judged of by the promptitude or the delay of this mission. in the mean time, our peace is  
left at the mercy of their officers whose interest &amp; wish is war with all mankind. and how can it be pretended that the  
subjects have no connection? they claim a right to take those whom they call their seamen (and, under that cover,  
ours also) wherever they can find them, even without their own jurisdiction. and 1. their officers are in the daily  
practice of taking them from on board our merchant vessels, &amp; with them many more of ours than of theirs. 2. they have  
repeatedly done the same in foreign ports and countries, particularly in Canton, in Lisbon, &amp; now lately in Madeira,  
going ashore &amp; siezing them in the streets and houses of the place. 3. in the instance now in question, they have  
extended it to the taking them by force from our national armed ships: &amp; 4. the next step may be to patrole, by their  
pressgangs the streets of New York &amp; Norfolk, &amp; take from thence all those who may suit them. their principle  
evidently goes to this extent. is it then sufficient to recieve satisfaction for an act done under one particular branch  
of this abuse, without any assurance that it will not be repeated the next day under the others? certain it is there never  
can be friendship, nor even a continuance of peace with England so long as no American citizen can leave his own shores  
without danger of being siezed by the first British officer he meets &amp; made to serve as a common seaman on board their  
ships of war: and, equally so that if the general question is not settled now, we may give it up for ever &amp; let our  
citizens understand that they are abandoned by their country to the unbridled power of every British naval commander.

They claim a right to take those whom

And 1st. Their officers are in trie daily

WASHINGTON, NOV. 30.  
We learn that our government received  
no letters from Mr. Murcroe by the British  
Packet lately arrived. It was before known  
that on the 7th of September, Mr. Munioe  
addrefled a note to Mr. Canming in coafes

complainirg of the aggreflion on the Chesa­  
peake, calling on that government for repa­  
ration of&#x27;the wrong, and for a fipal discus­  
sion and understanding on their claim to  
take whomsoever they chufe to call #heir sea­  
men, Wwherever found ; and afluring him at  
the fame time that he was authorded to  
concur in arrangements liberaily calenlated  
to take away all ground for that practice.  
It is now rumored that the answer was,that  
by the President’s proclamation we had tak­  
en the business of fatisfation for the aggres­  
sion on the Chesapeake, so far into our own 1  
hasds ; that {till however the Britith gov­  
ernment was ready to quter into a difcumon  
of that act, if it couldibe done separately,  
leaving their geperal claim to future negoei=  
ation; but as Mr, Munroe considered him­  
felf vrauthorifed to fettle this a&amp;t separate­  
ly, that government would enter with bimy  
“into no explanations concerning lit, but  
would {end a 2 minister to this place for that  
special purpose. Whether this is a mere  
manceuvre to aveid a settlement, and lose |  
the subject altogether in the endlefls mazes  
of ncgociation, is to be judged of Ly the {  
promptitude or delay of this mifhen. In  
the mean time our peace is left ar the mer­  
cy of their officers whose interest and wish l  
is war with all mankind ; and how can it  
be pretended that the subjects have no con­  
neftion ? They claim a right to take those  
whom they call #beir feamen—(and under that  
eover ours also) wherever they can find  
them, even without their own jurisdiction.  
And Ift. Their efficers are in the daily prac­  
tice of taking them from on board eur mer­  
chant veflels, and with them many more of  
eurs than of theirs. 2. They have repeat­  
edly done the fame in foreign ports and  
countries, particularly in Canton,in Lifbom,  
and now lately in Madeira, going ashore  
and seizing them in the ftrects and houses |  
of the place. 3. In the instance now in |  
question, they have extended it to the tak- |  
ing them by force from our national armed |

it then fufficient to receive fatisfaction so  
an 2&amp; done under one particular branch o
