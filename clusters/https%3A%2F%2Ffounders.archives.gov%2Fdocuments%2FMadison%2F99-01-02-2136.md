London, Sept. 16, 1807.  
SIR,  
  
I had the honour to receive your  
letter of July 6th, by Dr. Bullus,  
on the 31st ult., and did not lose a  
moment in entering of the busi-  
ness as communicated to me by it,  
in the manner which seemed most  
likely to obtain success. The de-  
tails shall be communicated to you  
  
403  
  
in my next dispatch. All that I  
can state at present is, that the  
whole subject has been placed ful-  
ly before this government, in as  
strong an appeal to its interest and  
judgment as I could make, and  
that, as a week has elapsed since  
my official note was presented, I  
am in daily expectation of receiv-  
ing its decision on it. The mo-  
ment is in many views very favour-  
able to a satisfactory result, but  
still it is not in my power, from  
any thing that has occurred, to  
speak with confidence of it. The  
joint negotiation committed to Mr.  
Pinkney and myself was suspend-  
ed by the intelligence of the affair  
with our frigate, and has never  
been revived since. ‘That intelli-  
gence reached this about a week  
after Mr. Purviance, so that we  
had only been able, with the utmost  
diligence, to take the preliminary.  
step of presenting to Mr. Canning,  
in conformity to our instructions,  
a project, and of explaining to him,  
in the most minute and compre-  
hensive manner that we could,  
every circumstance appertaining:  
toit. No answer was given to our  
communication; the suspension  
therefore of the negotiation was  
imputable to Mr. Canning: had  
he answered our communication,  
and proposed to recede in the ne-  
gotiation, it would have become a  
question for the commission to  
have decided, how far it would  
have been proper, under existing  
circumstances, to comply with the  
invitation ; his silence however re-  
lieved us from this dilemma.  
  
Iam, with great respect, sir,  
  
Your most obedient servant,  
JAMES MONROE.

Siv~~l had the honor to receive {  
your letter of July 6th, by Dr. Bul. ;  
lus, on the 31t ultimo, and did not  
lose « moment in enteringgon the bu­  
siness communicated to me by it in  
the manner which seemed most likely !  
to obtain success. The details shall  
be communicated to you in my next l  
dispatch. All that I can Rtate at pre­  
sent is, that the whole fubjeét has been i  
placed fully before this government  
in as strong an appeal to its interest  
and judgement as I could make, and  
that as a week has elapsed since my  
official note was presented, I am in  
daily expetation of receiving its deci­  
sion on it. The moment is in many  
views very favorable to a fatisfaltory  
result, but still it is not in my power,  
from any thing that has occurred, to  
{peak with confidence of it. The joint  
negociation committed to Mr. Pink­  
ney and myfelf, was suspended by the  
intelligence of the affair with our fri­  
gate,and has never been retvived since.  
That intelligence reached this about  
a week after Mr. Purviance, so that  
we had only been able with the ut­  
molft diligence, to take the prelimina­  
vy step of prefeating to Mr. Canhing,  
in conformity to our inftruétions, a  
projeé, and of explaining to him in  
the most minute and comprehensive  
‘manner that we could, every circum­  
stance appertaining toit. No answer  
was given to our communication ; the  
suspension therefore of the negocia­  
tion, was imputable to Mr. Canning :  
‘had hé apfwered our communication  
‘and proposed to proceed in the nego­  
ciatton, it would have become 2 quel­

Sir,—I had the honour to receive your let-  
ter of July 6th by Dr. Bullus cn the 3st ult.  
anddid not lose a moment in entering on the  
business communicated to me by it, in the  
manner which seemed most likely to obtain  
success. The details shall be communicated  
to youin my nextdispatch. All that I can  
staie at present is, that the whole subject bas  
been piaced fully before this government in  
as strong an appeal to its interest and judge-  
ment as I could make ; and that asa week  
has elapsed since my official note was pre-

sented, I am in daily expectation of teceiyiy  
  
its decision on it. The moment is in ma 4  
views very favourable to a satisfactory result  
but still is not in my power, from any thing  
that has occurred, to speak with confidence  
of it. The joint negociation committed to  
Mr. Pinckney and myself, was suspended  
by the intelligence of the affair with oy;  
frigate, and has never been revived since  
That intelligence reached this about a week  
after Mr. Purviance, so that we had only  
been able with the utmost diligence, to take  
the preliminary step of presenting to Mr.  
Canning, in conformity to our instructions,  
a project, and of explaining to him in the  
most minute and comprehensive manner that  
we could, every circumstance appertaining  
to it. No answer was given to our com-  
munication ; the suspension therefore of the  
negociation was imputable to Mr, Canning;  
had he answered our communication and  
proposed to aise ia Our negociation, it  
would have me 4 question for the com.  
mission to have decided, how far it would  
have been proper under existing circum-  
stances to comply with the invitation ; his  
silence however relieved us from that dilem-  
ma. Permit me to present to you, Mr. Jos.  
A. Smith of South Carolina, and to refer  
you to him for much information, of a gene-  
ral nature, on the subject of our affairs with  
this country. Having been long in Europe,  
and visited alm: st every part ; he  
  
great informaticn of the political state of its  
several powers, ‘especially of Russia, from  
whose sovereign he received very distin-  
guished marks of attention. In much com-  
munication which I have had with Mr, Smith  
for a yéar past, I have found him to be a0i-  
mated with strong sentiments of patriotism  
towards his country, and as he has expressed  
  
adesire of being noe y Nen-tte to the  
president, and yourself, I have been bapp  
to promote his object, by giving him  
introduction.
