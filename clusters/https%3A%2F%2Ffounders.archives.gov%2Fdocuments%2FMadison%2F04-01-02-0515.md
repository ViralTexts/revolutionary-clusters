Montpellier [ca. 10–31] Decr. 1819  
I have received Sir the copy of the Address of the Society of Tammany, with which I have been politely favored.  
The want of economy in the use of imported articles, enters very justly into the explanation given of the causes of the present general embarrassments. Were every one to live within his income or even the savings of the prudent to exceed the deficits of the extravagant, the balance in the foreign commerce of the nation, could not be against it. The want of a due economy has produced the unfavorable turn which has been experienced: Hence the need of specie to meet it, the call on the vaults of the Banks, and the discontinuance of their discounts, followed by their curtailments: Hence too the failure of so many of the Banks, with a diminished confidence in others: And hence finally a superabundance of debts, without the means of paying them.  
The Address seems very justly also to charge much of the general evil by which so many of the Banks themselves have been overwhelmed, on the multiplicity of these Institutions, and a diffusion of the indiscriminate loans, of which they have been the sources. It has been made a question whether Banks, when restricted to spheres in which temporary loans only are made to persons in active business promising quick returns, do not as much harm to imprudent, as good to prudent borrowers. But it can no longer be a doubt with any, that loan offices, carrying to every man’s door, and even courting his acceptance of the monied means of gratifying his present wishes under a prospect or hope of procrastinated repayments, must, of all devices, be the one most fatal to a general frugality, and the benefits resulting from it.  
The effect of domestic manufactures in diminishing imports, and as far as they are carried on by hands attracted from abroad, or by hands otherwise idle or less productively employed at home without a proportional diminution of the exports, merits certainly a distinguished attention in marking out an internal system of political Economy, and in counteracting a tendency in our foreign commerce to leave a balance against us. The relief from this source would be more effectual, but for the circumstance that the articles which contribute much to an excess of our imports over our exports, are articles, some not likely soon, others perhaps not all to be produced within ourselves. There is moreover a feature in the trade between this Country and most others, which promotes not a little an unfavorable result. Our Exports being chiefly articles for food, for manufactures, or for a consumption easily surcharged, the amount of them called for, never exceeds what may be deemed real and definite wants. This is not the case with our imports. Many of them, some the most costly, are objects neither of necessity, nor utility; but merely of fancy &amp; fashion, wants of a nature altogether indefinite. This relative condition of the trading parties, altho’ it may give to the one furnishing the necessary &amp; profitable articles, a powerful advantage over the one making its returns in superfluities, on extraordinary occasions of an interrupted intercourse; yet, in the ordinary and free course of commerce, the advantage lies on the other side; and it will be the greater in proportion to the lengthened credits on which the articles gratifying extravagant propensities are supplied. Such an inequality must in a certain degree controul itself. It wd. be compleatly redressed by a change in the public preferences &amp; habits, such as is inculcated in the address.  
In not regarding domestic manufactures as of themselves, an adequate cure for all our embarrassments, it is by no means intended to detract from their just importance, or from the policy of legislative protection for them.  
However true it be in general that the industrious pursuits of individuals, ought to be regulated by their own sagacity &amp; interest, there are practical exceptions to the Theory, which sufficiently speak for themselves. The Theory itself indeed requires a similarity of circumstances, and an equal freedom of interchange among commercial nations, which have never yet existed. All are agreed also that there are certain articles so indispensible that no provident nation would depend for a supply of them, on any other nation. But besides these, there may be many valuable branches of manufactures which if once established, would support themselves, and even add to the list of exported commodities: but which without public patronage, would either not be undertaken or come to a premature downfal[l]. The difficulty of introducing manufactures, especially of a complicated character &amp; costly outfit, and above all, in a market pre-occupied, by powerful rivals, must readily be conceived. They appear accordingly to have required, for their introduction into the Countries where they are now seen in their greatest extent &amp; prosperity, either the liberal support of the Government, or the aid of exiled or emigrant manufactures, or both of these advantages.  
In determining the degree of encouragement which can be afforded to domestic manufactures, it is evident that, among other considerations, a fair comparison ought to be made of what might be saved by supplies at home during foreign wars, to say nothing of our own, with the expence of supporting manufactures in times of peace, against foreign competitions in our market. The price of domestic fabrics, tho’ dearer than foreign, in times of peace, might be so much cheaper in times of war, as to be cheaper also than the medium price of the foreign taking the two periods together. Yet the Amn. Manufacturer if unprotected during the periods of peace wd. necessarily be undermined by the foreign; and he could not be expected to resume his undertaking, at the return of war, knowing the uncertainty of its continuance: and foreseeing his certain ruin at the end of it. Estimates on these points can not be made with much precision, but they ought not on that acct. to be overlooked; and in making them a strong leaning ought to be indulged towards the policy of securing to the nation independent resources within itself.  
If I have extended these remarks beyond the proper limits I must find my apology in the nature of the subject: &amp; in the tenor of your letter, for which I pray you to accept my acknowlegts. with my respects &amp; good wishes

the truding parties, although it may give  
to the wne turnishing the necessary and

advaatage lies on the other side; and it  
will be the greater in proportion to the  
lengthened credits on which the articles  
gratifying extravagant propensities are

a cortain degree, control itself. It would  
be completely redressed by a change in  
the public preference and habits, such as

In not rt&#x27;?arding domestic manufac­

Montpelier, Dec. 1819.  
  
I have received, sir, the copy of the address of  
the society of Tammany, with which I have been  
politely favored.  
  
The want of economy in the use of imported ar-  
ticles enters very justly into the explanation given  
of the causes ofthe present general embarrassmen‘s,  
Were every one to live within his income, or even  
the savings of the prudent to exceed the deficits  
of the extravagant, the balance in the foreign com-  
merce of this nation could not be against it. The  
want of a due economy has produced the unfavora-  
ble turn which has been experienced- Hence the  
need of specie to meet the call on the vaults of the  
banks, and the discontinuance of their discounts,  
followed by their curtailments: Hence too the  
failure of so many of the banks, with a diminished  
confidence in others: And hence, finally, a super-  
abundance of debts without the means of paying  
them.  
  
The address seems very justly to charge much of  
the general evil, by which the banks themselves  
have been overwhelmed, on the multiplicity of these  
institutions, and a diffusion of the indiscriminate  
loans of which they have been the sources. [t has  
been made a question, whether banks, when re-  
stricted to spheres in which temporary loans only  
are made to persons in active business, promising

ger be a doubt with any, that loan offices, carrying  
to every man’s door, and even courting the ac-  
ceptance of, the moneyed means of gratifying his  
present wishes, under a prospect or hope of pro-  
crastinated re-payments, must, of all devices, be the  
most fatal to a general frugality, and the benefits  
resulting frem it,  
  
The effect of domestic manufactures in diminish-  
ing imports, and, as far as they are carried on by  
hands attracted from abroad, or by hands other-  
wise idle or less productively employed, without a  
proportional diminution of exports, merits certainly  
a distinguished attention in marking out an internal  
system of political economy, and in counteracting  
a tendency in our foreign commerce to leave aba-  
Janceagainstus. The relief from this source would  
be more effectual, but for the circumstance that the  
articles which contribute muc!: to the excess of our  
imports over our exports, are articles, some not  
likely soon, others net at all, te be produced within  
ourselves. There is moreovera feature in the trade  
between this country and most others, which pro-  
motes not a littte an unfavorable result. Our ex-  
ports being chiefly articles of food, for manufac-  
tures, or for a consumption easily surcharged, the  
the amount of them called for never exceeds what  
may be deemed real and definite wants. ‘his is  
not the case with ourimports. Many of them, some  
the most costly, are objects neither of necessity nor  
utility, but merely of fancy and fashion, wants of  
a nature altogether indefinite. This relative condi-  
tion of the trading parties, although it may give to  
the one furnishing the necessary and profitable ar-  
ticles, 2 powerful advaniage over the one making  
its returns in superfluities, on extraordinary occa-  
sions of an uninterrupted intercourse, yet, in the  
ordinary and free course of commerce, the advan-  
tage lies on the other side; and it will be the great-  
erin proportion to the lengthened credits on which  
the articles gratifying extravagant propensities are  
supplied. Such an inequality must, in a certain  
degree, control itself. It would be completely re-  
dressed by a change in the public preferences and  
habits, such asis inculcated in the address.  
  
In not regarding domestic manufactures as of  
themselves an adequate cure forall our embarrass-  
ments, it is by no means intended to detract from  
their just importance, or from the policy of legisla-  
tive protection forthem.  
  
However true it be in general, that the industri-  
ens pursuits of individuals ought to be regulated  
by their own sagacity and interest, there are practi-  
cal exceptions to the theory, which sufficiently  
speak for themselves. The theory itself, indeed,  
requires a similarity of circumstances, and an equal  
freedom of interchange among commercial nations,  
which have never yet existed. All are agreed,  
also, that there are certain articles so indispensable,  
that no provident nation would depend for a sup-  
ply of them on any other nation. But besides these,  
there may be many valuable branches ef manufac-  
tures, which, if once established, would support  
themselves, and even add to the list of exported  
commodities; but which, without public patronage,  
would either not be undertaken, or come to a pre-  
mature downfall. The difiiculty of introducing  
manufactures, especially of a complicated charac-  
ter and costly outfit, and above all, in a market  
nre-occupied by powerful rivals, must readily be  
conecived, They appeai,-acecrdingly, to have re-  
quired, for their uitroduction into the countries  
  
vernment, or the aid of exiled or emigrant manu-  
facturers, or both of these advantages.  
  
In determining the degree of encouragement  
which van be afforded to domestic manufactures, it  
is evident that, among other considerations, a fair  
comparison ought to be made of what might be  
saved by ys at home during foreign wars, to  
say nothing of our own, with the experience of sup-  
porting manufactures in times of peace, against foe  
reign competitions in our market. The price of do-  
mestic fabrics, though dearer than foreign, in times  
, of peace, might be so mueh cheaper in timesof war,  
as to be cheaper alsothan the medium price of thefo-  
reign, taking the ‘wo periodstogether, Yet the Ame-  
rican manufacturer, if unprotected during the period  
of peace, would necessarily be undermined by the  
foreign; and he could not be expected to resume  
his undertaking at the return of war, knowing the  
uncertainty of duration, and foreseeing his certain  
ruin at the end of it. Estimates on these points  
cannot be made with much precision, but they are  
noton that account to be overlooked; and in mak-  
ing them, a strong leaning ought to be indulged  
towards the policy of securing to the nation inde-  
pendent resources within itself. 7  
  
If Ihave extended these remarks beyond the pro-  
per limits, I must find my apology in the nature of  
the subject, and in the tenor of your letter; for  
which I pray you to accept my acknowledgments,  
with my respects and good wishes.

Lmes Mulison&#x27;s Inawer.  
MoNricELlo, Dec. 20th, 1812.  
I have received, sir, the copy of the address of  
the Socicty of Tammany, with which I have been  
politely favored. The want of economy in the use  
of imported articles enters very justly into the exe  
planation given of the canses of the present general  
embarrassments. Were every one to live within  
his income, or were the savings of the prudent to  
exceed the delicits of the extravagant, the balance  
in the foreign commerce of the nation could not be  
against it. The want of a due cconomy has proe­  
duced the unfavorable turn which has been expe-  
rienced; hence the need of specic to mect it-the­  
call on the vaults of the banks--and the discontin-  
uance of their discounts, followed by their curtail-  
ments; hence, too, the failure of so many of the  
banks, with a diminished confidence in others;  
and hence, finally, a superabundance of debts, withe  
out the means of paying them.  
The addres seems very justly to charge much  
of the general evil, by which thee banks themselves  
have been overwhelmed, on the multiplicity of  
these institutions, and a diflusion of the indis-  
criminate loans of which they have been the  
sources. It has laen made a question, whether  
banks, when restricted to spheres in which teme­  
porary loans only are made to persons in active  
business, promis ing quich returns, do not as much  
harm to imprudent, a good to prudent, borrow  
ers. But it can no longer be a doubt with any,  
that loan offices, carrving to every man&#x27;s door,  
and even courting his acceptance, of the monied  
means of gratifving his present wishes, under a  
prospeet or hope of procrastinated repayment..  
must, ot all devices, be the most fatal to a general  
frugality, and the benefits resulting from it.  
The effect of domestic manulactures in dimin  
sshing imports, and, as far as they are carried on  
by hands attracted trom abroad, or by hands other  
wise idle or less productively employed, without a  
proportional diminution of exports, merit cer  
tainly, a distinguished altention, in marking out  
an internal system of political economy, and in  
counteractins a tendency in our forcign commerce  
to leave a balance against us. The relief from  
this source would be more effecinal, but for the  
curcumstance that the articles which contribute  
mtuch to an excess of our imports over our ex  
ports are articles, some not itkely, soon, others,  
perhaps mot at all, to be produced within oour  
selves. There is, moreover, a leature in the trade  
between this country and most others, which proe  
motes not a little an unfavorable result; our ex-  
ports being chictly articles for food, for manuface  
furce, or for a consumption casily surcharged, the  
amount of them called for never exceeds what  
may be deemed real and definite wants. This is  
not the case with our imports: many of them,  
some the most costly, are objects neither of net  
cessity or utility, but merely of fancy and faslion.  
wants of a nature altogether indefinite. This res  
lative conlition of the trading parties, although it  
may give to the one furnishing the necessary and  
protitable articles a powerful advantage over the  
one making its returns in superfluities, on extaa-­  
ordinary occasions of an uninterrupted intercourse.  
yet, in the ordinary and free course of conmerce,  
the advantage lies on the other side; and it will  
be the greater in proportion to the lengthened  
credits on which the articles gratifying extravagant  
propensities are supplied. Such an incquality  
must, in a certain degree, control itself. It would  
be completely redressed by a change in the public  
preferences and habits such as is inculented in the  
address. In not regarding domostic manufactures  
as of themselves an adequate cure for all our eme  
barrassments, it is by no means intended to der  
tract from their just importance, or from the policy  
of legislarke protection for them.

pend for a supply of them on any other nation.

branches of manufactures, which, if once estae

difficulty of introducing manufactures, especially of  
a complicated character and costly outht, and.  
above all, in a market preoccupied by powerful  
rivals, must readily be conceived. They appear.  
accordincly, to have required, for their introduction  
into the countries where they are now seen in their  
greatest extent and prosperity, either the liberal  
support of the Government, or the aid of exiled or  
emigrant manufacturers, or both of these advanta  
ges. In determining the degree of encouragement  
which can be afforded to domestic mannfactures, it  
is evident that, among other considerations, a fhir  
comparison ought to be made of what might be  
saved by supplics at home, during forcign wars, to

times of peace, might be so much cheaper in time
