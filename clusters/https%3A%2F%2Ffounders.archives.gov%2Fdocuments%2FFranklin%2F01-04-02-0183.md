ch 9, 1790, he described his correspondent as “a zealous Religionist whom I had relieved in a paralytic Case by Electricity, and who being afraid I should grow proud upon it, sent me his serious, tho’ rather impertinent, Cautions.” Huey may have been “a minister of the Gospel in the Southern part of New Jersey,” but no clergyman of that name is known to have served there. According to Smyth, he came from Lancaster County, Pa.  
  
Sir,  
Philada. June 6. 1753  
I received your kind Letter of the 2d Inst. and am glad to hear that you increase in Strength; I hope you will continue mending till you recover your former Health and Firmness. Let me know whether you still use the cold Bath, and what Effect it has.  
As to the Kindness you mention, I wish it could have been of more Service to you. But if it had, the only Thanks I should desire is, that you would always be equally ready to serve any other Person that may need your Assistance, and so let good Offices go round, for Mankind are all of a Family.  
For my own Part, when I am employed in serving others, I do not look upon my self as conferring Favours, but as paying Debts. In my Travels and since my Settlement I have received much Kindness from Men, to whom I shall never have any Opportunity of making the least direct Return. And numberless Mercies from God, who is infinitely above being benefited by our Services. These Kindnesses from Men I can therefore only return on their Fellow-Men; and I can only show my Gratitude for those Mercies from God, by a Readiness to help his other Children and my Brethren. For I do not think that Thanks, and Compliments, tho’ repeated Weekly, can discharge our real Obligations to each other, and much less those to our Creator.  
You will see in this my Notion of Good Works, that I am far from expecting (as you suppose) that I shall merit Heaven by them. By Heaven we understand, a State of Happiness, infinite in Degree, and eternal in Duration: I can do nothing to deserve such Reward: He that for giving a Draught of Water to a thirsty Person should expect to be paid with a good Plantation, would be modest in his Demands, compar’d with those who think they deserve Heaven for the little Good they do on Earth. Even the mix’d imperfect Pleasures we enjoy in this World are rather from God’s Goodness than our Merit; how much more such Happiness of Heaven. For my own part, I have not the Vanity to think I deserve it, the Folly to expect it, nor the Ambition to desire it; but content myself in submitting to the Will and Disposal of that God who made me, who has hitherto preserv’d and bless’d me, and in whose fatherly Goodness I may well confide, that he will never make me miserable, and that even the Afflictions I may at any time suffer shall tend to my Benefit.  
The Faith you mention has doubtless its use in the World; I do not desire to see it diminished, nor would I endeavour to lessen it in any Man. But I wish it were more productive of Good Works than I have generally seen it: I mean real good Works, Works of Kindness, Charity, Mercy, and Publick Spirit; not Holiday-keeping, Sermon-Reading or Hearing, performing Church Ceremonies, or making long Prayers, fill’d with Flatteries and Compliments, despis’d even by wise Men, and much less capable of pleasing the Deity. The Worship of God is a Duty, the hearing and reading of Sermons may be useful; but if Men rest in Hearing and Praying, as too many do, it is as if a Tree should value itself on being water’d and putting forth Leaves, tho’ it never produc’d any Fruit.  
Your great Master tho’t much less of these outward Appearances and Professions than many of his modern Disciples. He prefer’d the Doers of the Word to the meer Hearers; the Son that seemingly refus’d to obey his Father and yet perform’d his Commands, to him that profess’d his Readiness but neglected the Works; the heretical but charitable Samaritan, to the uncharitable tho’ orthodox Priest and sanctified Levite: and those who gave Food to the hungry, Drink to the Thirsty, Raiment to the Naked, Entertainment to the Stranger, and Relief to the Sick, &amp;c. tho’ they never heard of his Name, he declares shall in the last Day be accepted, when those who cry Lord, Lord; who value themselves on their Faith tho’ great enough to perform Miracles but have neglected good Works shall be rejected. He profess’d that he came not to call the Righteous but Sinners to Repentance; which imply’d his modest Opinion that there were some in his Time so good that they need not hear even him for Improvement; but now a days we have scarce a little Parson, that does not think it the Duty of every Man within his Reach to sit under his petty Ministrations, and that whoever omits them offends God. I wish to such more Humility, and to you Health and Happiness, being Your Friend and Servant

Philadelphia, Fune 6, 1753.  
Dzar Sir,  
  
I received your kind letter of the 2d inft. and ars glad  
to hear that you encreafe in flrength—I hope you will  
continue mending until you recover your former health  
and firmnefs. Let me know whether you flill ufe the  
cold bath and what effeé it has.  
  
Asto the kindnefs you mention, I wifhit could have  
been of more fervice to you ; but if it had, the only thanks  
1 fhould defire, are, that you would be always ready to  
ferve any other perfon that may need your affiftance, and  
{o let good offices go round, for mankind are all of a&gt; fami-  
ly. For my own part when I am employed in ferving o-  
thers 1 do not look upon myfelf as conferring favors, but  
as paying debts. In my travels and fince my fettlement,  
t have received much kindnefs from men, to whom I fhall  
never have an opportunity of making the leaft aeét re-  
urn: and numberlefs mercies from God, whois infinitely  
above being benefited by our fervices. Thefe kindneffes  
{om men I can therefore only return on their fellow-men ;  
and I can only fhew my gratitude to God by a readinefs  
to he:p his other children and my brethren. for I do not  
think that thanks and complimenis, though repeated weekly  
can difcharge our real obligations to each other, and much  
lefs io oe Creator,  
  
Yo) will fee in this my notion of good works, that I am  
far from expecting to merit heaven by them. By heaven  
we under Aand a flate of happinefs, infinite in degree and  
eternal in duration: I can do nothing to deferve fuch  
reward. He, that for giving a draught of water to a  
thirfly perfon, would expect to be paid witha good plan-  
tation, would be modefi in his demands compared with  
thofe who think they deferve heaven for the little  
they do on earth. Even the mixt imperfeé&amp; pleafures we  
enjoy in this world are rather from God’s goodnefs than  
our merit; how much more fo the happinefs of Heaven.  
For my own part I have not the vanity to think I deferve  
it, the folly to expect it, nor the ambition to defire it : but  
content myfelf in fubmiiting to the difpofal of that God  
who made me (who has hitherto preferved and_bleffed me)  
and in whofe fatherly goodnefs I may well confide, that he  
will never make me miferable, and that the affli€tion I may  
at any time fuffer may tend to my benefit.  
  
The faithyou mention hasdoubtlefs its ufe in the world.  
I co not defire to fee it diminifhed, nor would I defire to  
leffen it inany man; but I wilh it were more produttive  
of good works than I have generally feen it. I mean real  
  
woks, works of charity, mercy, mist sity {pirit ; not  
  
iday rkeeping, fermon hearing or ‘reading, performing }  
  
¢sremonies or making long prayers filled with  
  
r i  
  
flatteries and compliments, defpifed even by wife men, and  
much lefs capable of pleafing the deity. |  
  
The worthip of God is a duty ; the hearing and reading  
fermons may be ufeful, but if men reft in hearing and  
praying, as too many do, itis as if the tree fhould value 1-  
felfon being watered and putting forth leaves though it  
never produced any fruit.  
  
Your good mafter thought much lefs of the fe outward  
appearances than many of his modern difciples. He  
preferred the doers of the word to the hearers— the fon  
that feemingly refufed to obey his father and yet performed  
his commands, to him that profefled. his readinefs but ne-  
gleéted the work ; the heretical but charitable Samaritan  
to the uncharitable but orthodox prieft and fanétified Levite.  
and thofe who gave food to the hungry. drink to the  
thirfly, raiment tothe naked, entertainment to the ftranger’  
and relief to the fick, &amp;c. tho’ they never heard of his  
name, he declares fhall in the laft day be accepted—when  
thofe who ery Lord, Lord! who value themftlves on their  
faith, though great enough to perform miracles but have  
neglefted good works, fhall be rejefled. He profeffed  
that he came not to call the righteous but finners to re-  
pentance, which implied his modeft opinion that there  
were fome in his time fo good that they needed not hear even  
him for improvement. But now a-days we have {carcely  
a little parfon that does not think it the duty of every man  
within his reach to fit under his petty miniftrations, and  
that whoever omits them offends God—TI with to fuch  
more humility and to you health and firinne(s,  
  
Being your friend and fervant,

children, and my brethren, for I donot think that thanks  
and compliments, though repeated weekly, can difcharge  
our real obligations to each other and much lets to  
our Creator.  
  
You will fee in my notion of good works, that I am  
far from expeéting to merit heaven by them. By hea-  
ven we underftand a ftate of happinefs, infinite in de-  
gree and eternal in duration: I can do nothing to de-  
ferve fuch reward. He that for giving a draught of  
water toa thirfty perfon would expedét to be paid with

God’s goodnefs than our merit ; how much more fo the  
happinefs of heaven. For my own part I have not the  
vanity to think I deferve it; the folly to expect it, nor

mitting tothe difpoial of that God who made me, (who  
has hitherto preferved and bleffed me) and in whofe fa-  
ther!y goodnefs I may well confide, that he will never  
make me miferable, and that the affliction I may at any  
time fuffer may tend to my benefit.  
  
The faith you mention, has doubtlefs its ufe in the  
world. Ido not defire to fee it diminifhed, nor would  
] defire to leffen it in any man; but I with it were  
more productive of good works than I have generally  
feen it. I mean real good works, works of charity,  
mercy, and public fpirit ; not: holiday keeping, fermon  
hearing or reading, perfornfing church ceremonies or  
long prayers filled with flattéries and compliments, det-  
pifed even by wife men, and much lefs capable of pleaf-

Philadelphia, June 6,.1753. ,  
S1r,  
  
I received your kind letter of the 2nd instant,  
and am glad that you increase im strength; I  
hope you will continue mending till you recover  
your former bealth and firmness, Let me know  
whether you still use the cold bath, and what  
effect it has.  
  
As to the kindness you mention, I wish it could  
have been of more service to you. But if it had,  
the only thanks I should desire is, that you  
would always be equally ready to serve any other  
person that may need your assistance, and so-let  
good offices go round, for mankind are all of a  
family.  
  
For my own part, when I am employed in  
serving others, 1 do not look upon myself as  
conferring favours, but as paying debts. In my  
travels, and since my settlement, I have receiv-  
ed much kindness from men to whom I shall  
never have any opportunity of making the least  
direct return. And numberless mercies from  
God, who is infinitely above being benefited by  
our services. ‘he kindnesses from men I can,  
therefore, only return on their fellow-men, and  
I can only shew my gratitude for those mercies  
from God, by a readiness to help his other chil-  
dren and my brethren. For I do not think that  
thanks and compliments, though repeated week-  
ly, can discharge our real obligations to each  
other, and much less those to our creator. You  
will see in this my notion of good works, that I  
am far from expecting, as you suppose, to merit  
heaven by them. By Heaven we understand a  
state of happiness, infinite in degree, and eternal  
in duration: I can do nothing* to deserve such  
rewards. He that for giving a draught of water  
to a thirsty person, should expect to be paid  
with a good plantation, would be modest in his  
demands compared with those who think they  
deserve Heaven for the little good they do on  
earth, ,Even the mixed imperfect pleasures we  
enjoy in this world, aré rather from God&#x27;s good-  
ness than our merit; now much more such hap-  
piness of heaven. For my part, I have not the  
vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to expect  
it, nor the ambition to desiie it;. but content  
myself in submitting to the will and disposal of

served and blessed me, and in whose fatherly  
goodness I may well confide, that he will never  
make me miserable, and that even the afflictions  
I may at any time suffer shall tend to my bene-  
fit.  
  
The faith you mention has, doubtless, its use  
in the world. I do not desire to see it diminish-  
ed, nor would I endeavour to lessen it in any  
man. But I wish it were more productive of  
good works than I have generally seen it: I  
mean real good works—works of kindness, cha-  
rity, mercy, and public spirit; not holiday keep-  
ing, sermon reading or hearing, performing  
church ceremonies, or making long prayers, fil-  
led with flatteries and compliments, despised  
even by wise men, and much less capable of  
pleasing the deity. The worship of God is a  
duty, the hearing and reading of sermons may  
be useful, but if men rest in hearing and pray-  
ing, as too many do, it is as if a tree should  
value itself on being watered and putting forth  
leaves, though it never produced any fruit. Your  
great master thought much less of these out-  
ward appearances and professions than many of  
his modern disciples. He preferred the doers  
of the word to the mere hearers, the son that  
seemingly refused to obey his father, and yet  
performed his commands, to him that professed  
nis readiness, but neglected the work; the here-  
tical but charitable Samaritan, to the uncharitable  
though orthodox priest and sanctified Levite:  
and those who gave food to the hungry, drink to  
the thirsty, raiment to the naked, entertainment  
to the stranger, and relief to the sick, though  
they never heard of his name, he declares they  
shall in the last day be accepted, when those  
who cry Lord, Lord, who value themselves on  
their faith, though great enough to perform  
miracles, but have neglected good works, shall  
be rejected. He professed he came not to call  
the righteous, but sinners to repentance; which  
implied his modest opinion that there were some  
in his time so good, that they needed not to hear  
him even for improvement; but now a days we  
have scarce a little parson that does not think it  
the duty of every man within his reach to set  
under his petty administration; and that. who-  
ever omits them, offends God. I wish to such  
more humility, and to you health and happiness,  
being  
  
Your friend and servant,

Philadelphia, June 6th,  
IV,ar Sir,  
I received y. ur kind letter of tbe 2d

■• io Ur rigrh—T hope you will con­  
tinue mending, until you recover your  
fonn&#x27;r health Mid firmr.ef;. Let me  
know whether you ftill ufe the cold  
bath, and what effect it has.  
As to tbe ki-driefs yon mention, I  
wifh it coull have been of more ferious  
f-rvice to you ; Lot if it had, the c ly  
thanks 1 fhiuld deli r, are that you  
would always be ready to serve any other  
person that may need your assistance ;  
and fo let good office! go round ; for  
mankind are *li oi a f-i i.ily. For my  
o#n part, when I em employed in ferv­  
ing othe-r?, I da not loolc upon myfelf  
conterting favours, but as paying debts.  
In my travels and liner my fettiement,  
I h?ive received much kindnefs I  
men, to whom I (ball never have an  
opportunity of making the Icalt dire£t  
return ; -.nd nuinberlefs mercies

fes from men, I can, therefore only re­  
turn to their fellow-men ; and 1 can  
(r ly fhew my gratitude to God by a rra  
dinefs to help his other children, and my  
brethren, for 1 do not think that tl  
and compliments, though rep at. d W

each other, and much lefs to our Crea­

You will fee, in this my notion of good

Philadzlphia, June 6th, 1753,  
Dear Sir, ot  
I received your kind letter of the  
3d inst. and am glad to hear that  
you encreafe in strength—ll hope you  
will continue mending, until you re­  
cover your former health and firm­  
nefs. Let me know whether you [till  
use the cold bath, and what effe&amp;t it  
has.  
As to the kindness you meniion, I  
wish it ‘could have been es more seri­  
ous service to you ; but if it had, the  
only thanks I (hould desire, are that  
you would always Ee ready to [crve any  
other person that may nezd your affiflance ;  
and {o let good offices go round ; for  
mankind are all of a family. For my  
own part, when I am employed in  
serving others, I do not look upon  
myfelf conferring favours, but as pay­  
ing debts. In my travels and since  
my settlement, I have received much  
kindness from men, to whom I shall  
never have an opportunity of making  
the least direé&amp; return ; and numberless  
mercies from God, who is infinitely  
above being benefited by our servi­  
ces. These kindnefles from men, I  
can, therefore only return to their fel­  
low-men ; and I can only shew my  
gratitude to God by a readiness to  
help his other children, and my breth­  
ren, for I do not think that thanks and  
compliments, though repeated week­  
ly, can discharge our real obligations  
to each other, and much less to our  
Creator. ‘ .  
You will fee, in this my notion of  
good werks, that I am far from ex­  
pefting to merit Heaven by them.—  
By Heaven we understand a [tate of  
happiness, infinite 1n degree and eter­  
nal in duration. I can do nothing to  
deserve such a reward:. He that for  
giving a draught of water to a thirsty  
person should expect o be paid with a  
good plartation, would be modest in  
his demands, compared with those,  
who think they deserve Heaven for  
the little good they do on earth.  
LEven the mixt imperfe@ pleasures we  
enjoy in this world, are rather from  
God’s goodness than our merit ; how  
much more so the happiness of Heav­  
en? For myown part, I have not the  
vanity to think I deserve it, the fol­  
ly to expeét it, nor the ambition to de­  
sire it, but content myfelf in submit­  
ting to the disposal of that God who  
made me ( who has hitherto preserved  
and blefled me, and in whose father­  
ly goodness I may well confide) that  
he will never make me miserable, and  
that the affli¢tion I may at any time  
fuffer, may tend to my benefit.  
The faith you mention has doubt­  
less its use in the world. Ido not de­  
sire to fee it diminished, nor would I  
desire to leflen it in any man ; but I  
wish it were more produétive of good  
works than I have generally seen it.  
I mean real good works, works of  
kindness, charity, mercy and public  
{pirit ; not holyday keeping, sermon  
hearing or reading,pezforming chuich  
ceremonies, ormaking long. prayers  
. filled with flatteries and compliments,  
despised even by wife men and much  
less capable of pleasing the Deity.  
The worship of God is a duty, the  
hearing and reading may be wfeful,.  
but if men rest in hearing and pray­  
ing as too many do, it is as if the tree  
thould value itfclf on being watered  
and putting forth leaves, though it  
never produced any fruit. )  
Your good master thought much  
less of these outward appearances than  
many of his modern disciples. He  
preferred the doers of the word to the  
hearers ; the son that seemingly reful­  
ed to obey his father and yet perform­  
ed his commands, to him that profe(-  
fed his readiness, but neglected the  
work&#x27;; the heretical but charitable  
Samaritan to the uacharitable but or­  
thodox prieflt and fandtified Levite.  
And those who give food to the hun­  
gry, drink to the thirlty, and raiment  
1o the naked, entertainment to the  
Rranger, and relief to the sick, &amp;ec.  
‘thongh they never heard of his name,  
_he declares shall inthe last day beac-.  
cepted ; when thofg who cry Lord !  
  
[No. 50, of Vol. XLIX.  
  
Lord! who value themf{elves on their  
faith, though great erough to perform  
miracles, but have negle&amp;ed good  
works, shall be reje@ted.—He profeii­

-StR, ... . ; &#x27; , t m :  
I received your kind letter of the  
2d instant, and am glad that you in­  
crease in strength ; and I hope you  
will continue lSefiding, till you reco­  
ver your formef: strength andfirm­  
ness. Let me knot whether you  
still use the cold bath, and What ef­  
fect it has.  
As to the kindness you mention, I  
wish it could hare been of mote ser­  
viceto you. But if it had, the only  
thanks I should desire is, that you  
wowld be always equally ready to  
serve any other person that ma need  
your assistance, and so let good of  
fices go round, for mankind ire all  
of a family jj  
For my own part, when I arfi em­  
ployed in serving others, I do inot  
look upon myself as conferrihg fa­  
vors, but as paying debts. In  
travels, and since my settlernerf, I  
have received much kindness from  
men to whom I shall never have an  
opportunity of making the least direct  
return. And numberless mercies  
from God, who is infinitely above be  
: 1 i .  
uix uciicuticu uy our services. ! 1 he  
kindness from men I can, therefore,  
only return on their fellow men, and  
I can only shew niy gratitude for  
those mercies from CTod, by a readi­  
ness to help his other children and  
my brethren. For I do notthink  
that thanks and compliments though  
repeated weekly, can discharge our  
real obligations to each other, and  
much less those to our creator. You  
will see in this my notion of, good  
works, that I am far from expecting  
as you suppose, to merit heaven by  
them. By heaven, we understand a  
stite of happiness infinite in degree,  
ami eternal in duration . I can do  
nothing to deserve such &#x27; rewards.  
He that for giving a drought of ua­  
ter to a thirsty person, should expect  
tojbe paid with a good plantation,  
wcftild be modest in his demands,  
compared withnhose who think they  
deserve heaven for the little r-f.nd  
they do on earth. Even the rinsed  
imperfect pleasure we enjov in  
this &quot;world, are rather from God&#x27;s  
goodness than our nferit jHow  
much more such happiness of heaven.  
For; my paat I have not the vanity to  
tbink T deserve it, the folijrto expect  
it, nor the ambition to desire it ; but  
content rorseif in submitting to the  
will and disposal of tlat God who  
made me, who has &quot;hitjierto preser­  
ved and biased me, and in whose  
fatherly goodness I may well confide,  
that. he will never make,? tne misera­  
ble, and thtt even the anlietlo I  
may at any time suffer may tend to  
my benefit-  
The faith you mention has doubt­  
less its use in the world. I do not  
desire Usee it diminished, ror would  
I desire to lessen it In any man. But  
I wish it were more productive of  
good works than I have enrallv

when those who cry Lord! Lord! who value themselves on their faith,

- Philadelphia, June 6th, 1753.  
DEAR SIR,  
I received your kind letter of the 2d  
inst. and am glad to hear that you in­  
crease in firength—l hope you will  
continue mending, until you recover  
your former health and.firmnefs.—  
Let me know whether you still tfe the  
told bath, and what effe&amp; it has.  
As to the kindness you mention, 1  
wish it couid have been of more fer.  
vice to you ; but if it had, the only  
thanks 1 should desire, are that you  
would always be ready to serve any other  
person that may need your affiflance ; and  
so lec good offices go round 3 for man­  
kind are all of a. family. For my  
own part, when I am employed in  
serving others, I do not look upon my­  
felf conferring favors, but as paying  
debts. In my travels and since my  
feulement, I have received much kind­  
ness from men, to whom I shall never  
have an opportunity of making the  
leak dire&amp; return ; and numberless  
mercies frem God, who is infinitely a­  
bove being benefited by our services.  
These kindnefles from men, 1 can,  
therefore, only return to their fellow  
men ; and I can only thew my grati­  
tude to God by a readiness to help his  
other children, and my brethren, for  
I do not think that thanks and com­  
pliments,though repeated weekly, can  
discharge our real obligations. to each  
other, and much less to our creator.  
You will fee, in this my notion .of  
good works, that I am far from ex­  
pelling to merit heaven by them. By  
heaven we understand a state of hap­  
piness, infinite in degree and eternal in  
duration. I can do nothing to de­  
serve such a reward. He that for giv.  
ing a draught of water to a thirfly  
person thould expe&amp; to be paid witha  
good plantation, would be modes in  
his demands compared with those,  
who think they deserve heaven for the  
little good they do on earth. Even  
the mixt imperte pleasures we enjoy  
in this world, are rather from God’s  
goodnels than our merit ; how much  
more so the happiness of heaven ? For  
my own part, I have not the vanity  
to think I deserve it, the folly to éx­  
pect it, nor the ambition to desire it;  
but content myfelf in submitting to the

ed me, and m whose fatherly good­  
‘nefs I may confide) that he will nev­  
er make me miserable, and that the  
afili@ion I may at any time fuffer,  
may tend to my benefit. &#x27;

Philade*fihukt June 6, 175 3*  
SIR,  
I received your kind letter of the 2d  
inst am glad that you increase in  
strength ; I hope you will continue  
rnend-ng till you recover your former  
Health and firmness. Let me know  
whether you still use the cold bath and  
what effect it has.  
As to the kindness you mention, 1  
wish it cculd h3vc bean of more ser­  
vice to you. Rut if it had, the only  
thanks I should d.sire, is that you  
would always be equally ready to serve  
any oilier person that may need your  
i assistance and so let good offices go  
| round, lor mankind are all of a family.  
For my o va part, when I am employ­  
ed in serving others, I do not look up­  
m myself as conferring favors, bir as  
paying debts Iu my travel*, and since  
ny settlement, I have received touch  
kindness fi nm men tr» ivlinm 1 &lt;jha!! r./&#x27;_  
  
ver have an opportunity of making the  
&#x27;-ast direct return And numberless  
mercies from God who is infinitely a­  
hove being benefited by our services.  
The kindness from men i can there­  
ore, only return on their fellow men,  
and I can only shew my gratitude for  
these mercies from God by a readiness  
to help his other children and my bre­  
thren. For I do not think that thanks  
md compliments, though repeated  
weekly, can discharge our obligations  
to each other and mech less those to  
our creator Y &gt;u will see in this my  
notion of good works, that I am fur  
from expecting as you suppose, to me  
rit Heaven by them, by Heaven we  
understand j state of happiness, infinite  
hi degree and eternal in duration ; 1  
an do nothing to deserve such reward  
He that lor giving a draught of watei  
o a ttiirsty person should expect to be  
paid with ■ go id plantation would be  
nodest in his demands compared with  
hose who think they deserve Heaven,  
»or the little good they do here on  
;arth. Lven the mixed imperfect pica  
sores we enjoy in this world, are r«­  
tner from G d’s goodness than our me­  
it; how uiacli more such happiness  
if Heaven. F &gt;r idy pa t I have no  
the vanity to think 1 deiervc it, the fed.  
If to expect it nor the ambition to oe­  
-&gt;ire it ; but content myseli in submit’­  
ing to the will and disposal of that God  
who made me, who has hitherto pre­  
servid and blessed me, and in whose  
fatherly ^aoJness I may well confide,  
  
(battle will never make me miserable,  
and that even the afflictions I may a.  
any time suffer shall tend to my bene­  
fit.  
The faith you mention has doubtless  
its use in the world. I do not dcsite  
to sec it diminished nor would I lessen  
it in any man. I wish it were more  
productive of good works than I have  
generally seen it—1 mean real good  
works— works of kindness, charity,  
nicicy and public spirit—not holiday  
keeping, sermon leading or heating,  
pet forming church ceremonies, or long  
prayers filled wi’li flatteries and coinpli  
mints, despised even by wise men. and  
much less capable of pleasing the del  
ty. The wot ship of God is a duty the  
heating and reading of sermons may  
he useful, but if men rest in hearing  
and praying, as too many do, it is as ii  
a tree should value itself on being wa  
icrcd and putting forth leaves thoug h  
it never produce any fruit. Your grea:  
master thought much less of these out­  
ward appearances and prefessions, than  
many of his modern disciples. H»  
preferred the doers of the wo:d to the  
mere hearers, the son that seemingly  
refused to obey his father and yet per  
formed his commands, to him that pro­  
fessed his readiness, but neglected the  
work—ihc heretical but ckutiiable Sa­  
maritan to the uncharitable though or  
thodox priest and sanctified Levite—  
and those who gave food to the hungry,  
drink to the thirsty, raiment to the  
naked, and entertainment to the strang.  
cr, and relief to the sick, though they  
ncrci heard of his name, he declares  
they shall in the first day be accepted  
when those who cry Lord. Lord, who  
Value themselves on their faith, though  
great enough to perform miracles, but  
have neglected good works, shall be re­  
jected. He professed he came ii-jt to  
call the righteous but sinners to r&lt; pen  
•ance ; which implied in his modest  
  
opinion that there were some tn hi.-,  
time so good that they lidded not  
to hear him even for improvement ; !  
hut now a day3 we have sc.ace .» little  
parson that does not think it the duly  
of every man within his reach to set un­  
der his petty fdiniuistraiion, and thai  
whoever omits them, otrc..J» God. 1

. [| Pet. Int.  
PuitapExpura, June 6, 1753.  
  
Str—I received your kind letter of the 2d inst.  
and am glad that you increase in strength—I hope  
you will continue mending till you recover your for-  
mer health and firmness. Let me know whether  
you still use the cold bath and what effect it has.  
  
As to the kindness you mention, 1 wish it could  
have been of more service to you. But if it had,  
the only thanks I should desire, is that you would  
always be equally ready to serve any ot)er person  
that may need your assistance, and so let good of-  
fices go round, for mankind are all of a family.  
  
For my own part, when I am employed in serv-  
ing others, I do not look upon myself as conferring  
fuvors, but as paying debts.  
since my settlement, I have received much kind-  
ness from men to whom I shall never have an oppor-  
tunity of making the least direct return. And num-}  
berless mercies from God, who is infinitely above  
being benefitted by our services. ‘The kindness  
from men I can, therefore, only return to their fel-  
low men, and I can only shew my fratitude for  
these mercies from God by a readiness to help his  
other children and my brethren. For I de not think  
that thanks and compliments, though repeated  
  
  
  
  
  
weekly, can discharge our obligations to each other  
  
and much less of those to our creator. You see iy-  
this my notion of good works, that I am far from  
expecting, as you suppose, to merit heaven by them.  
By Heaven we understand a state of happiness, in-  
finite in degree and eternal in duration—I can do  
nothing to deserve such reward. He, that for giy-  
ing a draught of water to a thirsty person, shoul¢  
expect to be paid with a good plantation would be  
  
‘modest in his demands compared with those who  
  
think they deserve heaven fer the little good they  
do here onearth. Even the mixed, imperfect plea-  
sures we enjoy in this world, are rather from God’s  
goodness than eur merit—how much more such  
happiness of heaven. For my part, I have not the  
vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to expect it,  
nor the ambition to desire it—but content myself  
in submitting to the will and disposal of that God  
who made, who has hitherto preserved. and blessed  
me, and in whose fatherly goodness F may wellcon-  
fide, that he will never make me miserable, and  
that even the afflictions I may at any time suffer  
shall tend to my benefit.  
  
‘Phe faith you mention has, doubtless, its issue  
in the world. I do not desire to see it diminished,  
nor would I endeavor to lessen it in any man. F  
wish it were more productive of good works than  
I have generally seen it—I mean real good works—  
works of kindness, charity, mercy and public spt-  
rit—not holliday keeping, sermon reading or hear  
ing, performing church ceremonies, or long prayers,  
  
filled with flatteries and compliments, despised  
  
even by wise men, and much less capable of pleas-  
ing the Deity. The worship of God is a duty, the  
hearing and reading of sermons may be useful, but  
if men rest in hearing and praying, as too many do,  
it is as if a tree should value itself on being watered  
and putting forth leaves, though it never produced  
any fruit. Your great master thought much less of  
these outward appearances and professions than any  
of his modern disciples. He preferred the doers  
of the word to the mere hearers, the son that seem-  
ingly refused to obey his father, and yet performed  
his commands, to him that professed his readiness  
but neglected the work—the heretical, but charita-  
ble Samaritan, to the uncharitable, though orthodox  
priest and sanctified Levite—and those who gave  
food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, raiment to  
the naked, and entertainment to the stranger, and  
relief to the sick, though they never heard of his  
name, he declares they shall in the first day be ac-  
cepted, when those who cry Lord, Lord, who valuc  
themselves on their faith, though great enough to  
perform miracles, but have neglected good works,  
shall be rejected. He professed he came not to call  
the righteous, but sinners to repentance—which  
implied, in his modest opinion, that there were some  
in his time so good, that they needed not to hear  
him, even for improvement——but, now-a-days, we  
have scarce a little parson that does not think it  
the duty of every man, within his reach, to sit un-  
der his petty administration, and that whoever omits  
them, offends God. I wish ta such more humility,  
  
In my travels, and}and to you health and happiness, being your friend  
  
and servant, B. FRANKLIN.

Plﬁi.’adr[ﬁf:lﬂ, Junf 6! 14-53  
  
Deau Sin-=1 received your kind lener of  
the 2d inst. and am glad to hear that you in­  
cresse in strength&lt;~l hope you will continue  
mendiog until you recoves your former healih  
and, firminess. Let the koow whetber you  
sthil use the vold batly, and what effect it hoe,  
  
Asto the kindncss you mention, I wish it  
covid have been cf more seiious tervica  
10 you ; but if it hed, the only thanks T should  
desire, are, that you wondd altveys be reaay 10  
srrve any-la;llwrju&#x27;-r.&#x27;rh that may need yorr  
ascistance ; and so let pood cffices go reund ;  
for mankind are all of a family. Formy ow .  
Ittty when I am employed in serving cthers,  
1 do not lcok upon mysell as conferting [a­  
vours, but as paying debts.. In iy travels  
snd gince my settlement, I have received  
much Lindness Trom men, to whom I shali  
never have an opportubity of mauking the  
least direct retuen ; and numberless mercies  
from God, who is infinately «bove being beu­  
cfitted by owr services. “I&#x27;hese Lindnesses I  
can, therefore, only return to thiir fellow­  
men ; and I con only show my gralitude 10  
God Ly a readicess to help his other childreu,  
and my brethren, for I do not think that  
thanks and compliments, though repeatcd  
weekly, can dischare our real obligations 1o  
vach other, and much less our Creator.  
  
Yon will see, in this, my notion of good  
wotks, that 1 am far from expecting to mer?  
it heaven by them. DBy heaveo we under:  
stand a state of happinessy iofinite in degres  
and eternol in duration. I can do nothing to  
deserve stch a reward.—ile that for giving a  
diawght of water 10 a thirsty person should  
expect 10 be paid with a good plantation,  
would be modest in his demands compared  
with those, who think they deserve heaven  
for the little good they do on earth.—Lven  
the mixt, imperfect pleasure we enjoy it  
this werld, ure rather lrom God’s goodness  
than cur merit : how much more so the hap­  
piness of heaven! For my own party I have  
not the vanity to think I deseive it, the foliy  
to expect, nor the ambition to desire it, but  
content myself in submiving tothe disposal  
of that God who made me, (who has hitherto  
preserved and blessed me, and in whose fa­  
therly goodness | *ell confide) that ho  
wi&#x27;l never make me miserable, and thot the  
«fiction I may ot dny time suffer, may tend  
to oy benelit.  
The faith you me_!, har, doubtless, ita  
use in the world. ‘T do not desire to sce it  
diminished, nor would 1 desire to essen it in  
any man, but I wish it were more productive  
of good works than [ have generally oee”’,  
I mean real good works, works of kindpess,  
charity mercy and publick spirit ; not holyday  
keeping, sermon hearing or reading, perform­  
ing church cercmonies, or muking loog pray­  
ers filled with Nlatteries and compliment, des­  
piscd even by wise men snd much less capa­  
ble of pleasing the Deity.  
The worship of God is a duty-&lt;the hearing  
and reading may be useful ; but if men rest in  
hearing and praying, as too many do, it is ay  
if the tree should value itself on being water­  
ed and putting forch leaves, though it never  
produced any fruit,  
Your good master thought much less of  
these ontward appearances than many of his  
modern disciples. [le preferred the doors of  
the word to the hearers ; the son that seem­  
ingly refused to cbey Lis father and yet per­  
formed bis commands, to him that professed  
his readinese, hut neplected the work ; the  
heretical but charitable Samaritan, to the  
nneharitable but orthodex priest and sancti­  
fied Levite: And theee who give food to the  
hungry, drink tothe thirsty and raiment to  
the naked, entertainment to the stranger, end  
never heard of his name, he declares shall, in  
the last dav, be accepted ; when those who  
cry Loard! RLord! who value themselves on  
their fsith, theugh great enouch to pe:form  
miraclas, but have neglected pond werks,  
shall be rejected. He professed that he  
came not so call the righ&#x27;eons but sinners to  
repentamnco, which implied his modest opin­  
jon that there were some in his time so pood  
that they need not hear hin for improvement.  
But fow.a-days we have scarcely a little par­  
son that does not think it the du&#x27;y of every  
man within his reach to sit under his petly  
ministratinn, and that whoever omits this of«  
fends God. I wish &#x27;n such more humiliiy,  
and to you health and firmness.  
Deing your friend and servant,  
BENJAMIN FRANKLING.

Sin, Philadelphia, June 6, 1753.  
  
RECEIVED your kind letter of  
  
the 2d instant, and am glad to  
hear that you increase in strength; [  
hope you will continue mending ull  
you recover your former health and  
firmness. Let me know whether you  
still use the cold bath, and what  
eflect ut has.  
  
As to the kindness you mention, I  
wish it could have been of more  
service to you. But if it had, the  
only thanks [ should desire is, that  
you would always be equally ready  
to serve any other person that may  
need your assistance, and so let good  
attices go round; for mankind are all  
of a family.  
  
For my own part, when I am  
employed in serving others, 1 do not  
look upon myself as conferring fa-  
vours, but as paying debts. In my  
travels, and since my settlement, |  
have received much kindness from  
men, to whom [I shall never have  
any opportunity of making the least  
direct return; and numberless mer-  
from God, who is infinitely  
above being benefited by our services.  
‘Those kindnesses from men, | can  
therefore only return on their fellow  
men, and | can only shew my grati-  
twde for these inercies from God, by a

and my brethren. For | do not  
think that thanks and compliments,  
though repeated weekly, can discharge  
our real obligations to each other,  
and much less those to our Creator.  
You will see in this my notion of  
good works, that I am far from ex-  
ecting to merit heaven by them.  
  
y heaven we understand a state of  
happiness, infinite in degree, and  
eternal in duration: I can do nothing  
to deserve such rewards. Ue that for  
giving a draught of water to a thirst  
person, should expect to be paid with  
a good plantation, would be modest in  
his demands, compared with those  
who think they deserve heaven for the  
little good they do on earth. Even  
the mixed imperfect pleasures we  
enjoy in this world, are rather from  
God&#x27;s goodness than our merit: how  
much more such happiness of heaven!  
For my part, I have not the vanity to  
think I deserve it, the folly to expect  
ul, nor the ambition to desire it; but  
content myself in submitting to the  
will and disposal of that God who  
made me, who has hitherto preserved  
and blessed me, and in whose fatherly  
goodness [ may well confide, that he  
will never make me miserable ; and  
that even the afflictions | may at any  
time suffer shall tend to my benefit. ~  
  
‘The faith you mention has cer-  
tainly its use in the world: I do not  
desire to see it diminished, nor

which implied his modest opinion  
that there were some in his time who  
thought themselves so good that they

‘For my own part, when I am employed in serving others, I do  
not look upon myself as conferring favours, but as paying debts. In  
my travels, and since my settlement, | have received much kindness  
from men, to whom I shall never have any opportunity of making  
the least direct return; and numberless mercies from God, who is in-  
finitely above being benefited by our services. Those kindnesses  
from men, 1 can therefore only return on their fellow men, and I  
can only show my gratitude for these mercies from God, by a readi-  
ness to help his other children, and my brethren. For I do not think  
that thanks and compliments, though repeated weekly, can «ischarge  
our real obligations to each other, and much less those to our Crea-  
tor. You will see in this my notion of good works, that I am far  
from expecting to merit heaven by them. By heaven we under-tand  
a state of happiness, infinite in degree, and eternal in duration: I  
can do nothing to deserve such rewards. He that for giving a draught  
of water to a thirsty person, should expect to be paid with a good  
plantation, would be modest in his demands, compared with those  
who think they deserve heaven for the littke good they&#x27;do on earth,  
Even the mixed imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this world, are rather  
from God’s goodness than our merit: how much more such happiness  
of heaven! For my part, I have not the vanity to think I deserve it,  
the folly to expect it, nor the ambition to desire it; but content  
myself in submitting to the will and disposal of that God who made  
me, who has hitherto preserved and blessed me, and in whose fatherly  
goodness | may well confide, that he will never make me miserable ;  
and that even the afflictions | may at any time suffer shall tend to my  
benefit.  
  
‘The faith you mention has certainly its use in the world: I do  
not desire to see it diminished, nor would | endeavour to lessen it in  
apy man. But I wish it were more productive of good works, than  
I have generally seen it: 1 mean real good works; works of kindness,  
charity, mercy, and public spirit ; not holiday-keeping, sermon-reading,  
or bearing ; performing church ceremonies, or making long prayers,  
filled with flatteries and compliments, despised even by wise men,  
and much less capable of pleasing the Deity. The worship of God  
is a duty ; the hearing and reading of sermons may be useful; but if  
men rest in hearing and praying, as too many do, it is as if a tree  
should value itself on being watered and putting forth leaves, though it  
never produced any fruit.  
  
‘Your great Master thought much less of these outward appear-  
ances and professions, than many of his modern disciples. He pre-  
ferred the doers of the word to the mere hearers: the son that seem-  
ingly refused to obey his father, and yet performed his commands,

phia, the 6th of June, 1753 :—  
  
Sir,—I received your kind letter of the 2d inst. and am glad to hear  
that you increase in strength; [hope you will continue mending, till you  
  
recover your former health and firmness. Let me know wheth ti  
use the cold bath, and what effect it bas. pe  
  
. As to the kindness you mention, I wish it could have been of more ser-  
vice toyou. Butif ithad,the only thanks I should: desire is, that you  
would always be equally ready to serve any other person that may need your  
assistance, and so let good oflices go round ; for all mankind are one family.  
  
For my own part, when I am employed in serving others, I do not look  
upon myself as conferring favours; but as paying debts. In my travels,  
and since my settlement, I have received much kindness from men to whom  
I shall never have any opportunity of making the least direct return; and  
numberless mercies from God, who is infinitely above being benefited by  
our services. Those kindnesses from men, I can, therefore only return on  
their fellow men, and I can only show my gratitude for these mercies from  
God, by a readiness to help his other children, and my brethren. For I do  
not think that thanks and compliments, though repeated weckly, can dis-  
charge our real obligations to each other, and much less those to our Creator.  
  
You will see in this my notion of good works, that I am far from ex-  
pecting to merit Heaven by them. Heaven, we understand, is a state of hap-  
piness, infinite in degree, and eternal in duration; I cando nothing to de-  
serve such rewards. He that, for giving a draught of water to a thirsty per-  
son, should expect to be paid with a good plantation, would be modest ia

little good they do onearth. Even the mixt imperfect pleasures we enjoy  
in this world, are rather from God’s goodness than our merit: how much  
more such happiness of heaven! For my part I have not the vanity to think  
I deserve it, the folly to expect it, nor the ambition to desire it; but content  
myself in submitting to the will and disposal of that God who made me,  
who has hitherto preserved and blessed me, and in whose fatherly good-  
ness I may well confide, that he will never make me miserable; and that  
even the affliction that I may at any time suffer, shall tend to my benefit.  
  
The faith you mention has certainly its use in the world: I do not  
desire to see it diminished, nor would I endeayour to lessen it in any man.  
But I wish it were more productive of works than I have generally seen it:  
I mean real good works ; works of kindness, charity, and public spirit ; not

in strength—ll hope you will continue mend.-  
iog until yon recover your former health  
and firmnefs. Let me know whether you  
ﬁill use the cold bath, and what effe&amp; it  
ae.  
As to the kindnefls you mention, I wish  
it could have been of more serious service to  
you; but if it had the only thanks I should  
desire, are that gou would always be ready to  
serve any other perfos that may need your  
?ﬂiﬂance ; and so let geod offices go round ;  
or mankind are of a family, For myown  
part, when I am employed in {erving others,  
I do not look upon myfelf as conferring fa­  
vors, but as paying debts. In my travels,  
and since my settlement, I have received  
much kindness from men, to whom 1 shall  
never have an opportunity of making the  
leatt dire&amp;@ return ; and numberlef{s mercies  
from God, who is infnitely above being  
berefited by our services, Phefc hindneflea  
from them, I can therefore only return to  
their fellowmen, and I can only shew my  
gratitude to God by a readinels to help his  
other children, and my brethren, for I do  
not think that thanks .and compliments,  
though repeated weekly, can discharge our  
real obligations to each other, and much  
less to our Creator.  
You will fee, in this my notion of good  
works, that I am far frem expe&amp;ing to  
merit heaven by them.. By heaven we under­  
fland a {tate of happiness, iofinite in degree  
and eternal in duration. I can do nothing  
to deserve such a reward. He that for  
giving a draught of water to a thirlty per­  
son should expe&amp; to be paid with a good  
plantation would be modest in his demands,  
compared with those who think they de­  
serve heaven for the little good they do on  
earth. Even the mixt imperfe&amp; pleasures  
we enjoy in this world,are rather from God’s  
pgoodnefs than our merit ; how much more  
{o the happiness of heaven ? For my own  
part, I have not the vanity to think I de.  
_ {erve it, the folly to expe&amp; it, nor the am.  
bition to desire &#x27;it, but content myfelf in  
&quot; submitting to the disposal of that God whe  
made me (who bas hitherto preserved and |  
blessed me, and, in whose fartherly goodness 1  
I may_ wel! confide) that he will never.make i  
me miserable, and that the afli®ion I may  
at any time fuffer, may tend to my bw-%  
efit. : Y asid e  
The faith you mention has doubtless its  
use io the world. I do not desire to fee it  
diminish, nor would I desire to fee it leflen  
in any man ; but I wish it were more pre­  
duétive of good works, works of kindne(s,  
charity, mercy and, public {pirit, not holy  
day keeping, sermon hearing or reading,  
performing church ceremonies or making  
long prayers filled with flatteries and com­  
pliments, despised even by wife men and  
much less capable of pleasing the Deity.  
The worship of God is a duty, the hear­  
ing and reading may be ufeful, but if men  
rest in hearing and praying as too many do,  
it is as if the tree should value itfelf on be­  
ing watered and putting forth leaves, though  
it never produced any fruit..  
Your good malter thought mich less of  
these outward appearances than many of  
his modera disciples. He preferred the  
doers of the word to the hearers ; the son  
that {eemingly refufed to obey his father  
~ and yet performed bis commands, to him  
that profefled his réadinefs, but negle&amp;ted  
the work ; the heretical ‘but charitable  
. Samaritan to the uncharitable but orthodox  
priest and fanctified Levite. And those  
who give food to the bungry, drink to the  
thirfly, and raiment to the naked, entertain.  
ment to the stranger, and never heard of bis  
name, he declares shall in tife last diy be ac.  
- aepted 3 whea thofgywho cry Lord ! Lord !  
‘who value them{eles on their faith, though  
great ecough to perform thiracles, but, have  
negle@led good works, shall be reje@ed.—  
#le profcfled that he came not to cal the  
  
righteous but sinners to repentance, which  
implied his modest opinion, that there were  
some in his time so good that they need not  
hear even him for improvement. &#x27; But now  
adays we have scarcely a little parson that  
does not think it the duty of every man  
with in his reach to fit under his petty min­  
istration, and that whoever omits this of­  
fends God—ll wish to such, more humility  
and to you health and firmnefs.

PHILADELPAIA, Junx&amp; 6, 1743.  
  
Srr,—I received your kind letter of the second in-  
stant, and am glad to hear that you increase in strength,  
[ hope your will continue mending *till you recover  
your former health and firmness. Let me know wheth-  
er you still use the cold bath, and what effect it has.  
  
As to the kindness you mention, | wish it could have  
been of more service to you. But if it had, the thanks  
I should desire is that you would always be equally rea-  
dy to serve any other person that may need your assist-  
ance, and let good offices go round ; for mankind are  
all of a family.  
  
For my own part, when I am employed in serving  
others, | do not look upon myself as conferring favors ;  
but as paying debts. In my travels, and since my  
settlement, | have received much kindness from men,  
to whom I shal! never have any opportunity of making  
the least direct return; and numberless mercies from  
God, who is infinitely above being benefitted by our  
services. Those kindnesses from men, | can therefore  
only return on their fellow-men, and I can also  
shew my gratiude for those mercies from God, by  
a readiness to help his other children, and my brethren,  
for I do not think that thanks and compliments, though  
repeated weekly, can discharge our real obligations to  
each other, and much less those to our Creator. You  
will see in this my notion of good works, that I am far  
from expecting to merit Heaven by them. By Heaven  
we understand a state of happiness, infinite in degree,  
and eterna! in duration; we do nothing to deserve such  
rewards. He that, forgiving a draught of water to a  
thirsty person, should expect a plantation, would be  
modest in bis demands, compared with those who think  
they deserve Heaven for the little good they do on earth.  
Even the mixt, imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this  
world, are rather from God’s goodness than our merit ;  
how much more such happiness of Heaven! For my  
part I have not the vanity to think I deserve it, the (ol-  
ly to expect it, nor the ambition to desire it ; but con-  
tent myself in submitting to the will of that God who  
made me, who has hitherto preserved and blessed me,  
and in whose fatherly goodness | may well confide, that  
he will never make me miserable; and that even the  
affliction that 1 may at any time suffer shall tend to my  
benefit.  
  
The faith you mention has certainly its use in the  
world; I do not desire-to see it diminished, nor would  
I endeavor to lessen itin any man. But I wish it was  
more productive of good works than I have generally  
seen it ; 1 mean real good works,works of kinduess, cha-  
rity, mercy, and public spirit ; not holiday keeping, ser-  
mon reading or hearing ; performing church ceremonies  
or making long prayers, filled with flatteries and com-  
pliments, despised even by wise men, and much less ca-  
pable of pleasing the Deity. The worship of God is a  
duty ; the hearing and reading of sermons may be use-  
ful ; but if men rest in hearing and praying, as too many  
do, it is as ifa tree should value itself on being water-  
ed and putting forth leaves, though it never produced  
any fruit.  
  
Your great master thonght much less of these outward  
appearances and professions, than many modern disci-  
ples. He preferred the doers of the word, to the mere  
  
  
  
  
  
hearers ; the son that seemingly refused to obey his fath-  
er, and yet performed his commands, to him that profes-  
sed his readiness, but neglected the work ; the hereti-  
cal but charitable Samaritan, to the uncharitable tho?  
orthodox priest, and sanctified Levite ; and those who  
gave food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, raiment  
to the naked, entertainment to the stranger, and relief  
to the sick, though they never heard bis name, he de-  
clars shall in the last day be accepted; when those  
who cry Lord! Lord! who value themselves upon their  
faith, though great enough to perform miracles, but have  
neglected good works, shall be rejected. He professed  
that he came not to call the righteous, but sinners to re-  
pentance; which implied his modest opinion, that  
there were some in his time who thought themselves so  
good that they need not hear even him for improvement,  
but now a-days we have scarce a little parson that does  
not think it the duty of every man within his reach to  
sit under his petty ministrations—and that whoever o-  
mits them, offends God. I wish to such, more humility,  
and to you health and happiness ; being your friend and  
servant. B. FRANKLIN,

&quot; ruiLiDELriiiA, jcse 6, 1753.  
41 Dear Sir I received your kind  
letter of the 2d inst. and am glad to  
hear that you increase in strength I  
hope you will continue mending until  
)cu recover your former health and  
firmness. .Let me know whether you  
still use the cold bath and what effect  
it has. As to the kindness you men­  
tion, I wish it could have been of more  
serious service to you ; but if it had,  
the only thanks I should desire, are,  
that you would always be ready to  
serve any other person that may need  
your assistance ; and so let good offices  
go round ; for mankind are all of a  
family. For my own part, when I am  
employed in serving others, I do not  
look upon myself as conferring favours,  
but as paying debts. In my travels  
and since my settlement, I have receiv­  
ed much kindness from men, to whom  
I shall never have an opportunity of  
making the least direct return ; and  
numberless mercies from God, who is  
infinitely above being benefited by our  
services. These kindnesses from men,  
I can, therefore, only return to their  
fellow men ; and I can only show my  
gratitude to God by a readiness to help  
his other children, raid my brethren,&quot;  
for I do not think that thanks and com­  
pliments, though repeated weekly, can  
discharge our real obligations to each  
other, and much less, to our Creator.  
&quot; You wTill see, in this, my notion of  
good works, that I am far from expect­  
ing to merit heaven by them. By  
heaven, we understand a state of hap­  
piness, infinite in degree and eternal  
in duration. I can do nothing to de­  
serve such a reward. He that, for  
giving a draught of water to a thirsty  
person, should expect to be paid with  
a good plantation, would be modest in  
his demands compared with those who  
think they deserve heaven for the little  
good they do on earth. Even the mix­  
ed imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this  
world, are rather from God&#x27;5 goodness  
than our merit ; how much mere so  
  
the happiness of heaven ? for my part,  
I have not the vanity to think that I  
deserve it, the folly to expect it, or the  
ambition to desire it, but content my­  
self in submitting t; the disposal of  
that God who made me, who has hith­  
erto preserved and blessed me, and in  
whose fatherlv goodness I mav well  
conf.de, that he will never make me  
miserable, and that the affliction I mav  
at any time suffer, may tend to my ben­  
efit.4fc The faith you mention lias, doubt­  
less, its use in the world. I do not  
desire to see it diminished, nor could  
I desire to see it lessened in any m;:n ;  
  
uut x wish it were more productive or  
good works than I have generally seen  
it. I mean real good works, works of  
kindness, charity, mercy and public  
spirit ; not holy-day keeping, sermon­  
hearing, reading; performing church  
ceremonies, or making long prayers,  
filled with flatteries and compliments,  
despised even by wise men, and much  
less capable of pleasing the Deity.  
u The worship of God is a duty  
the hearing and reading may be useful ;  
but if men rest in hearing and praying-,  
as too many do, it is as if the tres  
should value itself on being watered  
and putting forth leaves, though it never  
produced any fruit.  
44 Your good master thought much  
less of these outward appearances than  
many of his modern disciples, lie  
preferred the doers of the word, to  
the hearers ; the son that seemingly re­  
fused to obey his father and yet per­  
formed his commands, to him that r.-fessed  
his readiness but neglected-work  
; the heretical but charitable -  
maritan, to the uncharitable but or:-dox  
priest and sanctified Levite ; . J  
those who gave food to the hun,  
drink to the thirsty and raiment to ir.  
naked, entertainment to the strange r,  
and never heard cf his name, he de­  
clares shall, in the last day, be accep:  
ed ; when those who cry, .Lord, Lora,  
who value themselves on their faith,  
though great enough to perform mira­  
cles, but have neglected good works,  
shall be rejected. He professed that  
he came not to call the righteous, but  
sinners to repentance, which implied  
his modest opinion that there were  
some in his time so good that they need  
not hear even him for improvement ;  
but now-a-days we have scarcely a lit­  
tle parson that does not think it the  
duty of every man within his reach to­  
sit under his petty administration, and  
that whoever omits this offends God  
I .wish to such more humility, and to  
tyou. health and firmness. Being your  
  
triend and servant,

* Philadelphia, June 6, 1753.  
  
‘ Dear Sir:—IL have received your kind letter of the 2nd inst,  
and am giad to bear that your tucrease in strength—TI hope you will  
continue mending until you recover your former health and firm-  
ness. Let me know whetber you. still use the cold bath, &amp; what  
effect it has. As tothe kindness you mention, L wish it could have  
b en of more serious service to you: but if it bad, the only thanks  
I should desire, are, that you would slways be ready to serve any  
other person that may need your assistance; and so let good offices  
eo round; for mankind are ailefa family. Bor my own part,  
when Lame ingloyed in serving others, bdo not lock upoo myseif  
as conferring “aveurs, but as paying debts. In my uravels and  
since my sci lemem, Lb have received much kindness from men. to  
whom — shailnever have an opportunity of making the least direct  
returo; and nusberless mercies from God, who is infinitely above  
being beneliited by our services. “hese kinduesses from men, [  
can, therefore only return to their fellow wen; and can only show  
my gratitude to God by a readiness to help his other children and  
  
ss!  
my brethrea, for bdo not think that thanks and complaints, though  
  
repeated weekly, cin di charge our real oblig:dons to each other,  
  
and much less to our Creator.  
  
“You will see, inthis my notion of good works, that [am far  
from expecting lo mierit heaven by them. By heaven. we under-  
stand a siate of liippiness, infinite in degree and eternal in duration.  
T cando nothing - deserve sucha reward. He that, for giving  
a draught of water toa thirsty person should expect to be paid with  
a cood plantation, would be modest in his demands, compared with  
those who think they deserve heaven for the little good they do on  
earth. HKven the mixed imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this world,  
are rather from God’s gocdness than our merit; how much more so  
the happipvess of heaven? for my part L bave not the vanity to think  
I deserve it, the folly to expect itor the ambition te desire. but  
centent myself in sabmitting to the disposal of that God who  
made me, and in whose fatherly go dness | may well confide. that  
he never will make me miserable, and that affliction L may at any  
time suffer, may benefit.  
  
“Phe faith you mention has, doubtless, its use in the werld,  
1 do not desire to see it diminished, nor would I desire to see it  
lessened inany man, but I wish it were more productive or good

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
idelphia, June 6, 1753.  
Drar Sir,  
  
l received your kind Jetter of the 2d inst.  
and am glad to hear that you increase in  
strength—I hope you will continue mend-  
ing until you recover your former health  
and firmness. Let me know whether you  
still use the cold bath, and what effect it has.  
  
As to the kindness you mention, I wish  
it could have been of more serious service to  
you; but if it had, the only thanks I should  
desire, are that you would always be ready to  
serve any other frerson thet may need your ase  
sistance; and so let good offices go round,  
for mankind are ali of a family. - for my  
own part, when I am employed in serving  
others I do not look upon myself as confer-  
ring favors, but as paying debts. In my tra-  
vels and since my settlement, I have receiv-  
ed much kindness from men, to whom I  
shall never have an opportunity of making  
a direct return; and nwwberless mercies  
from God, who is infirely: above being  
benefited by our services. These kind-  
nesses from them, I can therefore only re-  
turn to their fellow men; and ft can only  
shew my gratitude to God by a readiness to  
help his other children, and my brethren, for  
I do not think that thanks and compliments,  
though repeated weekly, can discharge our  
real obligations to each ether, and much  
less to our Creator.  
  
You will see, in this my notion of good  
works, that I am far from expecting to merit  
heaven by them. By heaven we under-  
stand a state of happiness, infinite in de-  
gree and eternal in duration. ~I can do no-  
thing to deserve such a reward. He that  
for giving a draught of water to a thirsty  
person should expect to be paid with a good  
plantation, would be modest in his demands  
compared with those who think they de-  
serve heaven for the little good they do on  
  
| earth. ven the mix’d imperfect pleasures  
  
  
  
‘Twe&#x27;enjoy in this world, are ra  
  
| own part, I have fot the vanity to think I  
_ bition to desire it, but ‘content myself in  
| submitting to the disposal of that (;o0d who  
| Ll may well confide) that he will never make  
/ use in the world.  
‘any man; but I wish it were more produc-  
| forming church ceremoni  
; much less capable of plea sing the Deity.

‘Dear Sir,  
  
J received your kind letter ef the 2d inst. and am  
glad to hear that you increase in strength—I hope you  
will continue mending until you recover your former  
health and firmness. Let me know whether you still  
use the cold bath, and what effect it has. As to the  
kindness you mention, I wish it could have been of  
more serious service to you; but if it had, the only  
thanks { should desire, are, that you woald always be  
ready to serve any other person that may need your  
assistance ; and so let good offices go round: for man-  
kind are all of a fasnith. For my own part, when I am  
enployed in serving others, |} do not look upon myself  
as conferring en but as paying debts. In my travels  
and since my settlement, | have received much kindness  
from men to whom I shall never have an opportunity of  
making the least direct return ; and numberless mercies  
from God, who is infinitely above being benefitted by our  
services. These kiadnesses from men, I can, therefore,  
only return to their fellow men; and I can only show  
my gratitude to God by a readiness to help his other  
children, and wy brethren, for I do not think that thanks  
and compliments, though repeated weekly, can discharge  
our real obligations to each other, and much less, to our  
Creator.  
  
“You will see, in this my notion of good works, that  
I am far from’oxpecting to merit heaven by them. By  
heaven, we und !rstand a state of happiness, infinite in  
degree and eternal in duration. I can do nothing te

demands compared with those who think they deserve  
heaven for the little good they do on earth. Even the  
mixed imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this world, are  
rather from God’s goodness than our merit ; how much  
more so the happiness of heaven? For my part, I have  
not the vanity to think [ deserve it, the folly to expect  
it, or the ambition to desire it, but content myself in  
submitting to the disposal of that God who made me,  
who has hitherto preserved and blessed me, and in  
whose fatherly goodness I may well confide, that he  
never will make me miserable, and that the affliction I  
may at any time suffer, may tend to my benefit.  
  
“The faith you mention has, doubtless, its use in the  
world. Ido not desire to see it lessened in any man,  
but L wish it were more productive of good works than  
I have generally seen it. I medh real good works of  
kindness, charity, mercy and public spirit ; not holy-day  
keeping, sermon hearing or reading ; performing church  
ceremonies, or making long prayers, filled with flat-  
teries and compliments, despised even by wise men, and  
much less capable of pleasing the Deity.  
  
“The worship of God is a duty—the hearing and  
reading may be useful ; but if men rest in hearing and  
praying as too many do, it is as if the tree should value  
itself on being watered and putting forth leaves, though  
it never produced any fruit.  
  
“Your good master thought much less of these outward  
appearances than many of his modern disciples. He  
preferred the doers of the word to the hearers; the son  
that seemingly refused to obey his fathepj,and yet per-  
formed his commands, to him that profeseed his readi-  
ness, but neglected the work ; the herdyical but char-

1 wish it could have been of more serious  
service to you, but if it had, the only thanks  
I should desire are, that you should always be  
ready to serve any other person that may  
need your assistance; and so let good offices  
go round, for mankind are all ofa family. For  
my own part, when I am employed in serv-  
ing others, I do not look upon myself as con-  
ferring favours, but as paying my debts. In  
my travels, and since my settlement, I have  
received much kindness from men, to whom  
I shall never have an opportunity of making  
the least direct return ; and numberless mer-!  
cies from God, who is infinitely above being  
benefitted by our services. These kindnesses,  
from men, I tnerefore only return to their fel-|  
low-men; and I can only show my gratitude|  
to God by a readiness to help his other chil |  
dren, and my brethren, for I do not think that!  
thanks and compliments, though repeated)  
weekly, can discharge our real obligations te.  
each other, and much less to our Creator. |

works, that I am far from expecting to merit,  
heaven by them. By heaven we understand)  
a state of happiness, infinite in degree and)  
eternal in duration. Lean do nothing todesers e|  
such a reward. He that, for giving a draught)  
of water to a thirsty person, shouid expect ie  
be paid with a good plantation, would be mo-&#x27;!  
dest in his demands, compared with those  
who think they deserve heaven fer the little|  
good they do on earth. Even the mixed im-|  
perfect pleasmres we enjoy in this world, are’  
rather from God’s goodness than our merit ;  
how mucli more so, the happiness of heaven?)  
For my part, I have not the vanity to think)  
I deserve it, the folly to expect it, or the am-,  
bition to desire it but content myself in sub-!

me, who has hitherto blessed me, and in whose|

for 1 do not think that thanks ~. com-  
pliments, though repeated weekly, can  
discharge our ad obhgation to each other,  
and much less to our creator. You will  
see in this my notion of good works. That  
I am far’ from expecting to merit heaven  
by them. ;  
By heaven we understand a state of  
happiness infinite in degree and eternal in  
duration ; we do nothing to deserve such  
rewards. He that, for giving a draught  
of water to a thirsty person, should ex-  
pect a plantation. woul be modest in his  
demands, compared with those who think  
they deserve heaven for the little good  
they do on earth. Even the mixed im-  
perfect pleasures we enjoy in this world,  
is rather from God’s goodness than our  
merits ; How much more such happiness  
of heaven. For my part [ have not the  
vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to  
expect it, nor the ambition to desire it:  
but content myself in submitting to the  
will of that God who made me, who has  
hitherto preserved and blest me, and in  
whose fatherly goodness I may well con-  
fide, that he will never make me misera-  
ble ; and that even the affliction that I  
may at any time suffer, shall tend to my  
benefit.  
  
The faith you mention has certainly its  
use in the world. I do not desire to see  
it diminished, nor would I endeavor to  
lessen it in any man; but I wish it was  
more productive of good works, than |  
have generally seen it. | mean real gooil  
works, works of kindness, charity, mercy,  
and public spirit; not holiday keeping,  
sermon reading or hearing ; performing  
church ceremonies, or makin, long pray-  
ers filled with flatteries and compliments,  
despised even by wise men, aud much less  
capable of pleasing the Deity. The  
worship of God is a duty : the hearing  
and reading of sermons may be useful ;  
but if men rest in bearing and praying, as  
too many do, it is as if atreeshould value  
itself on being watered and putting forth  
leaves, though it never produced any  
fruit.  
  
Your great master thought much less  
of these outward appeardnces and pro-  
fessions than many modern disciples. He  
preferred the doers of the word to the  
mere hearers ; the son that seemingly re-  
fused to obey his father, and yet periorm-  
ed his commands, to him that professed  
readiness, but neglected the work ; the  
heretical but charitable Samaritan, to the  
uncharitable though orthodox priest and  
sanctified Levite : and those that gave food  
to the hungry, drink to the thirsty,  
raiment to the naked, entertainmen: to  
the stranger, and relief to the sick, though  
they never heard his name, he declares  
shall, in the last day, be accepted ; when  
those who cry Lord! Lord! who value  
themselves upon their faith, though great  
enough to perform miracles, but have neg-  
lected good works, shall be rejected. He  
professed he came not to cull the  
righteous, but sinners to repentance ;  
which implies his’ modest opinion, that  
there were some in his time who thought  
themselyes so good that they need not

I do not think that thanks and compliments,  
though repeated weekly, can discharge our real  
obligations to each other, and much less to our  
Creator.  
  
You will see, in this, my notion of good  
works, that I am far from expecting to merit  
heaven by them. By heaven we understand a  
state of happiness, infinite in degree, and eter-  
nal in duration. I can do nothing to deserve  
such a reward, He that, for giving a draught  
of water to a thirsty person, should expect to be  
paid with a good plantation, would be modest  
in his demands, compared with those who think  
they deserve heaven for the little good they do  
on earth. Even the mixed imperfect pleasures  
we enjoy in this world, are rather from God’s  
goodness than our merit; how much more so  
the happiness of heaven? For my part, I have  
not the vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to  
expect it, or the ambition to desire it ; but con-  
tent myself in submitting to the disposal of that  
God who made me, who has hitherto preserved  
and blessed me,’ and in whose fatherly good-  
ness I may weil confide, that he never will  
make me miserable, and that the afflictions I  
may at any time sufler, may tend to my benefit.  
  
‘The faith you mention has doubtless its use  
in the world; but I wish it were more produc-  
tive of good works than I have generally seen  
it. I mean real good works; works of kind-  
ness, charity, mercy, and public spirit; not  
holy-day keeping, sermon hearing or reading,  
performing church ceremonies, or making long  
prayers, filled with flatteries and compliments,  
despised even by wise men, and much less ca-  
pable of pleasing the Deity.  
  
The worship of God is a duty; the hearing  
and reading may be useful ; but if men rest in  
hearing and praying, as too many do, it is as if  
the tree should value itself on being watered,  
and putting forth leaves, though it never pro-  
duced any fruit.  
  
Your good master thought much less of these  
outward appearances than many of his modern  
disciples. He preferred the doers of the word  
to the hearers : the son that seemingly reiused  
to obey his father, and yet performed his com-  
mands, to him that professed his readiness, but  
neglected the work, the heretical but charita-  
ble samaritan to the uncharitable but orthodox  
priest and sanctified Levite. And those who  
gave food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty,  
and raiment to the naked, entertainment to the  
stranger, and relief to the sick, and although  
they never heard of his name, he declares shall  
in the last day be accepted; when those who  
cry Lord! Lord! who value themselves on  
their faith, though great enough to perform  
Miracles, but have neglected good works, shall  
  
  
  
  
  
be rejected, He professed that he came not  
to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance,  
which implied his modest opinion, that there  
were some in his time so good that they need  
not hear even him for improvement. But now-  
a-days we have scarcely a little parson, that  
does not think it the duty of every man within  
his reach to sit under his petty ‘ministration,  
and whoever omits this offends God, I wish  
to such more humility, and to you health and  
firmness,  
Being your friend  
and servant,  
B. FRANKLIN.

PHILADELPHIA, June 6, 1753.  
  
Sir,—I received your kind letter of the 2d inst. and am  
glad to hear that you increase in strength. I hope you will  
continue mending till you recover your former health and firm-  
ness. Let me know whether you still continue to use the cold  
bath, and what effect it has.  
  
As to the kindness you mention, I wish it could have been  
of more service to you. Butif I had the thanks I should de-  
sire, it is that you would always be equally ready to serve any  
other person that may need your assistance, and let good offi-  
ces go round; for mankind are all of a family.  
  
For my own part, when I am employed in serving others,  
I do not look upon myself as conferring favors; but as paying  
debts. In my travels, and since my settlement, I have re-  
ceived much kindness from men, to whom 1] shall never have  
any opportunity of making the least direct return; and num-  
berless mercies from God, who is infinitely above being bene-  
fitted by our services. These kindnesses from men, I can  
therefore only return on their fellow men; and can also show  
my gratitude for these mercies from God, by readiness te  
help his other children, and my brethren. For I do not think  
that thanks and compliments, though repeated weekly, can  
discharge our real obligations to each other, and much less  
those of our Creator.  
  
You will see in this my notions of good works—that I am  
far from expecting to merit Heaven by them. By Heaven,  
we understand a state of happiness, infinite in degree and  
eternal in duration.—I can do nothing to deserve such re-

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Philadelphia, Fuue 6, 1763*  
Sir—I received your kind letter of the  
2d inst. and am glad to hear that you in­  
crease in strength. I hope you will con­  
tinue mending till you recover your for­  
mer health and firmness. Let me know  
whether you still use the cold bath, and  
what effect it has.  
As to the kindness you mention, 1 wish  
it could have been of more service to you.  
But if it had, the thanks I should desire^  
is, that you would always be equally ready  
to serve any other person that may need  
your assistance, and let good offices go  
round, for mankind are all of a family.  
For my own pari, when I am serving  
others, I do not look upon myself as con­  
ferring favors ; but as paying debts. In  
my travels, &#x27;and since my settlement, I  
have received much kindness from tjgan,  
to whom I shall never have any opportu­  
nity of making the least return ; and num­  
berless mercies from God, who is infinite­  
ly above being benefitted by our services.  
These kindnesses from men, I can  
therefore only r|pirn on their fellow men ;  
and can also show my gratitude for these  
mercies from God, by a readiness te help  
his other children, and my brethren. For  
I do not think that thanks and compli­  
ments, though repeated weekly, can dis­  
charge our real obligations to each other,  
and much less those to our Creator. Tou  
will see in this, my notion of good works  
—-that I am far from expecting to merit  
Heaven by them. By Heaven, we un­  
derstand a state of happiness, infinite in  
degree, and eternal in duration. I can do  
nothing to deserve such rewards. He that,  
Air giving a draught of water to a thirsty  
person, should expqct a plantation, would  
be modest in hit 4&lt;tifttands, compared with  
those who think thiy deserve Heaven for  
the little good they do on mirth. Even  
[themixt, imperfect pleasures we enjoy  
in this world, are rather from God’s good­  
ness, than our merit; how much more,  
such happiness as Heaven ! For my part,  
I have not the vanity to think to deserve  
it, the folly to expect it, nor the ambition  
to desire it; but content myself in sub­  
mitting to the will of that God who made  
me, who has hitherto preserved and bles­  
sed me, nnd in whose fatherly gooduess 1  
may well confide, that be will never make  
me miserable ; and that even the affliction  
that I may at any time suffer, shall tend  
to my benefit. The faith you mention,  
has certainly itsuse in the world : 1 do  
not desire to igpt diminished, nor would  
I endeavor to lessen itjnany man. But I  
wish it was more productive of good Vttdts  
than 1 have generally seeb it : I mean  
real good works—work^pf kindness, char­  
ity, mercy, and public spirit.; not holiday  
keeping, sermon reading or hearing; per­  
forming church coremonies, or making  
&quot;Mi- v* ;  
  
long prayers, tilled with tUtinmnand com­  
pliments, despised even by wise men, and  
much less capable of pleasing the Deity.  
The worship of God is a duty ; the hear­  
ing and reading of sermons may be useful;  
but if men rest in hearing and proving as  
too jmany do, it is as if a tree should value  
itself on being watered and putting forth  
leaves, though it never produced any  
fruit.  
Your great Master thought much less of  
these outward appearances and professions,  
than many modern disciples. He prefer­  
red the doers of the word, to the mere  
hearers; the son that seemingly refused  
to obey his father, and yet performed his  
commands, to him that professed his read­  
iness, but neglected the work ; the hereti­  
cal but charitable Samaritan, to the unchar­  
itable though orthodox priest , and  
sanctified Ley i; and* ritesj| who gave  
feod to the h y, drink to the thirsty, rai­  
f ment to tHI|f ^^^Brtainmeet to the  
stranger,. totbebsick, though  
they never heard his name, he declares  
shall in the last day be accepted; when  
those who cry, Lord ! Lord ! who value?  
: themselves upon their faith, though great  
I enough to perform miH|cle»|?bi*t have neg­  
lected good works, slid!! be rejected. He  
t professed that he came ndt to call the  
| righteous, but sinners to repentance ;  
which implied his modest opinion, that  
there were some in his time who thought  
themselves so good, that they need not  
hear even him for improvement; but  
now-a-days, we have scarce a little par­  
son, that does not think it the duty of eve­  
ry man within his reach to sit under his  
Iminisifations—and that whoever omits  
them, offeriKs God. 1 wish to such more  
humility ; and to you, health and happi­  
ness ; being your friend and servant,  
B. FRANKLIN.

Sin :—I received your kind letter of the

ing till you recover your former health and  
firmness, Letgne know whether you still use  
the cold bathyand what effects it has.  
  
As to the Tadecis you mention, f wish it  
could have been of more service to you, but  
if it had, the only gMauks I should desire, are,  
that you may be always equally ready to  
serve any person that may need your assis-

manhind are alla family. For my own part.  
when { am employed in serving others, [ de  
not look upon myself as bestowing favors, but  
as paying debts. In my travels, and since  
my settlement, I have received much kind-  
ness from men to whom [I shall never have an  
opportunity of: making the least direct return,  
and numberless blessings from God, who is  
  
‘infinitely above being benefitted by our ser-.  
| vices.  
  
The kindness of men, [ can only re-  
turn on their fellow men; and I can only shew  
my gratitude for these mercies from God by a  
readiness to help his other children, my breth-  
ren. For I do not think that thanks and com-  
pliments, though repeated weekly, can dis-  
charge our real obligations to each oer, and  
much less to our creator.—You will in this,  
see my notion of good works ; and that | am  
far from expecting heaven by them. By hea-  
  
  
  
;can do nothing to deserve such rewards.

Even the mixed, imperfect pleasures wé en-  
joy in this world, are rather from God’s good-  
ness than our merit—How much more so  
then the happiness of heaven. For my own  
part, | have not the vanity to think I deserve  
  
Hit; the folly to expect it; nor the ambition to  
  
desire it; but content myself with submitting  
to the will and disposal of him that made me—  
who has hitherto preserved and blessed me ;  
and in whose fatherly goodness 1 may wel!  
confide, that he will never make me misera-  
ble; and that even the afflictions I may at any  
time sufler, shall tend to my benefit.—The  
faith you meution, bas, doubtless, its use in  
the world, I do not desire to see it diminish,  
nor would I desire to lessen it in any man, but  
I wish it was more productive of good words,  
of works of kinduess, charity, and mercy, and  
public spirit—not holiday keeping, sermon  
reading, and hearing, performing church cer-  
emonies, or making long prayers, filled with  
flatteries and compliments, déspised even by  
wise men, and much less capable of pleasing  
the Deity. The worship of God is a duty—  
  
  
  
the hearing or reading sermons may be useful ;  
  
c  
  
but if a man rest in hearing or praying, as!  
many do, itis asif a tree should value itself  
upon being watered and putting forth leaves,  
though it never produced any fruit.  
  
Your great master thought !&gt;ss of those  
outward appearances and professions, than  
many of his modern disciples. He preferred  
the doers of the word to the mere hearers—  
the son that seemingly refused to obey iis fa-  
ther, and performed his commands, to him that  
professed his readiness, and yet neglected his  
work—the heretical and charitable Samaritan,  
to the uncharitable, the dissatisfied priest—and  
those who gave food to the hungry, drink to  
the thirsty, raiment for the naked, entertain  
  
though they never heard of his name, he de-  
clares shall in the last day be accepted, when  
those who ery Lord! Lord! who value them-  
selves on their faith, though great enongh to  
perform miracles, but have uveglected good  
works, shall be rejected. He professed that  
he came not to call the righteous, but sinners  
to repentance’, which implies his modest opin-  
ion, that there were some in his time so good  
that they needed not to hear even him for im-  
provement; bat now a-days, we have scarce  
a little parson who does not think it the duty  
of every man within his reach to sit ander his  
ministration, and whoever omits these offends  
God. I wish to such, more humility, and to  
you, Sir, more health and happiness—being  
your friend, aud humble servant.

tion the authenticity of the letter. Without further preface, therefore,  
we present it to our readers, just as it has been communicated to us.  
  
Copy of a letter said to have been written by Benjamin Franklin,  
to a clergyman, who came for the recovery of his health, and had  
lived or boarded with him, Benjamin Franklin, in his family. Going  
away he wrote back acknowledging kindness, and to whose letter  
this is thought to be an answer. .  
Purapevpnia, June 6, 1S—  
  
Sir—I have received your kind letter of the second instant, and  
am glad to hear that you increase in health. I hope you will continue  
mending till you recover strength and firmness. [|  
whether you still use the cold bath, and what effect it has. As to  
the kindness you mention, I wish it could have been of more service  
to you; but if it had, the only thanks I should desire, is, that you  
would always be equally ms! to serve any other person that may  
need your assistance, and so, let good offices go round, for mankind  
are all of a family ; for my own part, when Iam employed in serving  
others, I do not look upon myself as conferring favours, but in pay-  
ing debts. In my travels, and since my settlement, I have received  
much kindness from men, to whom I shall never have an opportu-  
nity of making the least direct return, and numberless mercies from  
God, who is infinitely above being benefited by our services. These  
kindnesses from men I can only therefore return of their fellow men,  
and can show my gratitude for those mercies from God, by a.rea-  
diness to help his other children, and my brethren; for I do not think  
that thanks and compliments, though repeated weekly, can discharge  
our obligation to pom other, much less to our Creator.  
  
You will see in this my notion of good works, that I am far from  
expecting to merit heaven by them. By heaven we understand a  
state of happiness, infinite in degree, and eternal in duration. I can  
do nothing to deserve such a reward. He that for giving a draught  
  
of water to a thirsty person should expect to be paid with a good ||  
  
plantation, would be moderate in hisdemand compared with those who  
think they deserve heaven for the little good they do on earth. Even  
the mixed imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this world, are rather from  
  
For my own part, I have not the vanity to think I deserve it, the  
folly to expect it, nor the ambition to desire it, but content myself in  
submitting to the will and disposal of that God who made, and has  
  
hitherto blessed me, and in whose fatherly goodness I may well con- ||  
  
fide, that he will never make me miserable, and that the afflictions,  
that I may at any time suffer, shall tend to my benefit. The faith  
you mention has doubtless its use in this world; I do not desire to  
see it diminished, nor would I desire to lessen it in any man, but I  
wish it was more productive of good works, than I have generally  
seen it. I mean real good works, works of charity, kindness, mercy,

and public spirit; not holiday keeping, sermon reading or ~ En:  
performing church ceremonies, or making long prayers filled with |  
flatteries and ccmpliments, despised even by wise men, and much  
less capable of pleasing the Deity. The worship of God is a duty;  
the hearing and reading of sermons may be useful; but if men rest  
in hearing and praying, (as too many do,) itis as if a tree should value  
itself on being watered, and putting forth leaves, though it never  
produced any fruit.  
  
Your geod master thought much less of these outward appearan-  
ces and professions, than many of his modern disciples. He preferred  
  
the doers of the word to the mere hearers; the son that seemingly |)  
  
refused to obey his father, and yet performed his commands to him  
  
that professe e f  
but charitable samaritan, to the uncharitable but orthodox priest and  
  
sanctified levite; and those who gave food to the hungry, drink to ||  
  
the thirsty, raiment to the naked, entertainment to the stranger, and  
relief to the sick, &amp;c., though they never heard of his name, he de-  
clares, shall in the last day be accepted, when those who cry Lord!  
Lord! who value themselves on their faith, as if it was sufficient to  
‘rform miracles, but have neglected good works, shall be rejected.  
e professed that he came not to call the righteous, but zinners to  
repentance, which implied his modest opinion that there were some  
in his time so good, that they used not to hear him even for improve-  
ment. But now-a-days we have scarce a little parson that does not  
think it the duty of every man within his reach, to sit under his petty  
administration, and that whoever omits them offends his God.  
wish to such more humility, and to you health and happiness. Be-  
ing your friend and servant, B. FRANKLIN.

Copy of a letter said to have been written by  
Benjamin Franklin to a clergyman, who came  
for his health, and had Jived or boarded with |  
him, B. F., in his family—Going away he  
wrote back acknowledging kindness, and to  
whose letter this is thought to be an answer.  
  
Puttaperpata, June 6, 17—.  
  
Sir:—lI have received your kind letter of the  
2d inst. and am glad to hear that you increase  
in health. I hope you will continue mending  
till you recover strength and firmness, Let me  
know whether you still use the cold bath, and  
what effect it has. As to the kindness you  
mention, I wish it could have been of more  
service to you; but if it had, the only thanks I  
should desire, is, that you would always be  
equally ready to serve any other person that  
may need your assistance, and so let good  
offices go round, for mankind are all of a family ;  
for my own part, when I am employed in serv-  
ing others, I do not look upon myself as confer-  
ring favors, but as paying debts. In my trav-  
els, and since my settlement, I have received  
much kindness from men, to whom I shall never  
have an opportunity of making the least direct  
return, and numberless mercies from God, who  
is infinitely above being benefited by our ser-  
vices. These kindnesses from men I can only  
therefore return on their fellow men; and can  
show my gratitude for those mercies from God  
by a readiness to help his other children, and  
my brethren: for I do not think that thanks and  
compliments, though repeated weekly, can dis-  
charge our obligations to each other, much less  
to our Creator.  
  
You will see in this my notion of good works,  
that I am far from expecting to merit heaven by  
them. By heaven we understand a state of  
happiness, infinite in degree, and eternal in du-  
ration. I can do nothing to deserve such a re-  
ward. He that for giving a draught of water  
to a thirsty person should expect to be paid with  
a good plantation, would be moderate in his de-  
mand compared to those who think they deserve  
heaven for the little good they can do on earth.  
Even the mixed imperfect pleasures we enjoy in  
this world, are rather from God’s goodness than  
our own merit—how much more such happiness.  
For my own part, I have not the vanity to think  
I deserve it, the folly to expect it, nor the ambi-  
tion to desire it; but content myself in submit-  
ting to the will and disposal of the God who  
made, and has hitherto blessed me, and in whose  
fatherly goodness I may well confide, that he  
will never make me miserable, and that the af-  
flictions I may at any time suffer shall tend to  
my benefit—The faith you mentioned has  
doubtless its use in this world; I do not desire  
to see it diminished, nor would I desire to lessen  
it in any man, but I wish it was more produc-  
tive of good works than I have generally seen  
it—I mean real good works, works of charity,  
kindness, mercy, and public spirit; not holyday  
keeping, sermon reading or hearing, performing  
church ceremonies, or making long prayers  
filled with flatteries and compliments, despised  
even by wise men, and much less capable of  
pleasing the Deity, The worship of God is  
  
  
  
&#x27;daty ; the hearing and reading of sermons may  
  
  
  
be useful; but if men rest in hearing and pray-  
ing, (as too many do,) itis as if a tree should  
value itself on being watered, and putting forth  
leaves, though it never produced any fruit.  
Your Good Master thought much less of  
these outward appearances and professions than  
many of his modern disciples. He preferred  
the doers of the word to the mere hearers: the  
son that seemingly refused to obey his father,  
and yet performed all his commands, to him that  
professed his readiness but neglected the work:  
the heretical but charitable Samaritan, to the  
uncharitable but orthodox Priest and sanctified  
Levite ; and those who gave food to the hungry,  
drink to the thirsty, raiment to the naked, en-  
tertainment to the stranger, and relief to the  
sick, &amp;c., though they never heard of his name,  
he declares shall in the last day be accepted;  
when those who cry Lord! Lord! who value  
themselves on their faith, as if it was sufficient  
to*perform miracles, but have neglected good  
works, shall be rejected. He professed that he  
came not to call the righteous, but sinners to  
repentance, which implied his modest opinion  
that there were some in his time so good, that  
they need not to hear even him for improve-  
ment. But now-a-days we have scarce a little  
parson that does not think it the duty of every  
man within his reach to sit under his petty ad-  
ministration, and that whoever omits it offends  
his God. I wish to such more humility, and to  
you health and happiness. Being your friend  
and servant: B. FRANKLIN.

nothing to deserve such a reward. He, that, for  
giving a draught of water to athirsty person, should  
expect to be paid with a great plantation, would be  
modest in his demands, compared with those who  
think they deserve heaven for the little good they  
do on earth. Even the mixed imperfect pleasures,  
we enjoy in this world, are rather from God’s good-  
ness than our merit; how much more so the hap-  
piness of heaven? For my part, I have not the  
vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to expect it,  
or the ambition to desire it; but content myself in  
submitting to the disposal of that God, who made  
me, who has hitherto preserved and blessed me,

The faith you mentioned has doubtless its use in  
the world. I do not desire to see it diminished, nor  
would I desire to see it lessened in any man ; but  
I wish it were more productive of good works than  
I have seen; I mean real good works, works of  
kindness, charity, mercy, and public spirit, no holy-  
day-keeping, sermon-hearing, or reading, perform-  
ing church ceremonies, or making long prayers,  
filled with flatteries and compliments, despised even  
by wise men, and much less capable of pleasing  
the Deity.  
  
The worship of God is a duty, the learning and  
reading may be useful; but if man rest in hearing

leaves, though it never produced any fruit.

weekly, can discharge our real obligations to each

MARY STAR.  
Letter of Franklin.  
The November number of the Southern Literary­  
Messenger publishes the following excellent and  
interesting letter written by Dr. BEezaMiN Eeane  
Lin to a minister of the Gospel in New-Jersey,  
among whose papers it was recently discovered.  
It has never before been published.  
PHILADELPHTA, June 6, 1765.  
DeAR Sir: I received your kind letter of the  
2d inst., and am glad to hear that you increase in  
strength. I hope you will continue mending un  
til you recover your former health and firmness.  
Let me know whether you continue the cold bath,  
and the effect it has. As to the kindness you  
spoke of I wish it could have been of more real  
service to you; that you would always be ready to  
serve any other person that may need your assist-  
ance, and so let good offices go round; for man  
kind are all of a family. For my own part when  
I am employed in serving others, I do not look  
upon myself as conferring favors, but as paying  
debts. In my travels, and since my settloment, I  
have received much kindness from men, to whom  
I shall never have an opportunity of making the  
least direct return, and numberless mercies from  
God, who is infinitely above being benefited by  
our services. For the kindnesses of men, I can  
therefore only show my gratitude to God, by a  
readiness to help his other children and my breth  
ren; for I de not think that thanks and complie  
ments, though repeated weelly, can discharge our  
real obligations to each other, and much less to  
our Creator.  
You will see in this my notion of good works  
that I do not expect to merit heaven by them.  
By heaven, we understand a state of happiness,  
infinite in degree, and eternal in duration; we  
can do nothing to deserve such a reward. He  
that, for giving a draught of water to a thirsty  
person, should expect to be paid with a great  
plantation, would be modest in his demands, com  
pared with those who think they deserve heaven  
for the little good they do on earth. Even the  
mixed imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this world,  
are rather from God&#x27;s goodness than our merit-  
how much more so the happiness of heaven? For  
my part, I have not the vanity to think I deserve  
it, the folly to expect it, or the amabition to desire  
it; but content myself in submitting to the dispe  
sal of that God who made me, who has hitherto  
preserved and blessed me, and in whose fatherly  
goodness I may well confide, that he never will  
make me miserable, and that the affliction I may  
at any time suffer, may tend to my benefit.  
The faith you mention has doubtless its use in  
the world. I do not desire to see it diminished,  
nor would I desire to see it lessened in any man;  
but I wish it were productive of more good works  
than I have seen; I mean real goed works--works  
of kindness, charity, mercy and public spirit,-no  
holyday-keeping, sermon-hearing, or reading per  
forming church ceremonies, or making long pray-  
ers, filled with flatteries and compliments, de  
spised even by wise men, and much less capable  
of pleasing the Deity.  
The worship of God is a duty; the learning and  
reading may be useful; but if man rest in hearing  
and praying, (as too many do,) it is as if the tree  
should value itself on being watered, and putting

Our Good Master thought less of these outward

who cry Lord! Lord, who value themselves on  
their faith though great enough to perform mira-­  
cles, but have neglected good works, shall be neg-­

plied his modest opinion, that there were some in

LetteR oF FrANILI.  
The November number of the Southern Liter  
ary Messenger publishes the following excel  
lent and interesting letter written by Dr. Be-  
tAMIs FrAnklin to a minister of the Gospel  
in New-Jersey, among whose papers it was re  
cently discovered. It has never before been  
published.  
PhilAdElPHIA, June 6, 1705.  
Dear Sir:-I received your kind letter of  
the 2d inst., and am glad to hear that you increase  
in strength. I hope you will continue mend­  
in until you recover your former health and  
firmness.--Let me know whether you continue  
the cold bath, and the effect it has. As to the  
kindness you spoke of, I wish it could have been  
of more real service to you; that you would  
always be ready to serve any other person that  
may need your assistance, and so let good of  
fices go around; for mankind are all of a fami­  
ly. For my own part, when I am employed in  
serving others, I do not look upon myself as  
conferring favors, but as paying debts. In my  
travels, and since my settlement, I have re­  
ceived much kindness from men, to whom I  
shall never have an opportunity of making the  
least direct return, and numberless mercies  
from God, who is infinitely above being bene­  
fitted by our services. For the kindness of men  
I can therefore only show my gratitude to God  
by a readiness to help his other children and  
my brethren; for I do not think that thanks  
and compliments, though repeated weekly, can  
dircharge our real obligations to each other,  
and much less to our Creator.  
You will see in this my notion of good works,  
that I do not expect to merit heaven by them.  
By heaven, we understand a state of happiness  
infinite in degree, and eternal in duration;   
can do nothing to deserve such a reward. He  
that, for giving a draught of water to a thirsty  
person, should expect to be paid with a great  
plantation, would be modest in his demands,  
compared with those who think they deserve  
heaven for the little good they do on earth.  
Even the mixed imperfect pleasures we enjoy  
in this world, are rather from God&#x27;s goodness  
than our merit--how much more so the happi-  
ness of heaven! For my part, I have not the  
vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to expect  
it, or the ambition to desire it; but content  
myself to submitting to the disposal of that God  
who made me, who has hitherto preserved and  
blessed me, and in whose fatherly goodness I  
may well confide, that he never will make me  
miserable, and that the affliction I may at any  
time suffer, may tend to my benefit.  
The faith you mention has doubtless its ure  
in the world. I do not desire to see it dimin-  
ished, nor would I desire to see it lessened in  
any man; but I wish it were productive of  
more good works than I have seen; I mean  
real good works--works of Kindness, charity,  
mercy and public spirit--no holyday-keeping,  
sermon hearing, or reading, performing church  
ceremonies, or making long prayers, filled with  
flatteries and compliments, despised  
even by  
  
wise men, and much less capabte of pleasing the  
  
Deity  
The worship of tod is a duty; the learning  
and reading may be useful; but if man rest in  
hearing and praying, (as too many do,) it is as  
if the tree should value itself en being watered  
and putting forth leaves, though it never pro­  
duced any fruit.  
Our Good Master thought less of these out  
ward appearances than many of his modern lis-  
ciples. He preferred the doers of his word to  
the hearers; the son that seemingly refused to  
obey his fither, and yet performed his com  
mandments, to him that professed his readiness  
but neglected his work. The heretical but  
charitable, those who gave food to the hungry.  
drink to the thirsty, and raiment to the naked,  
entertainment to the stranger, who never heard  
of his name, he declaares shall, in the last day,  
be accepted when those who cry Lord, Lord!  
who value themselves on their faith though  
great enough to perform miracles, but have ne-  
glected good works, shall be neglected. He  
professed that he came not to call the righteous  
but sinners to repentance, which implied his  
modest opinion, that there were rome in hi  
time so good that they needed not to hear even  
for improvement; but now-a-days, we have  
scarcely a little parson who does not think it  
the duty of every man within his reach to sit  
under his petty ministration, and that, wheever  
omits this, offends God, I wish to such more hu-  
mility, and to you health and Firmness--being  
your friend and servant,

itur remark-i, &#x27;&#x27;it is a composition perfectly in the mail.  
nor and spirit ol that great and worthy man.  
&quot;Philadelphia, June the 6th,j 1765.  
&#x27;Drab, sir: I received vour kind letter of the 2d  
insl., and am glad to haar that you incroase in strength  
1 hope you will continue mending until you recover  
your former health and firmness. Let me know whoth  
er you continuo tho cold baih, and what effort it has.  
As to the kindness you spoke of, I wish it could havo  
been of more real service to you; that you would  
ways be ready to servs any other person that may need  
your assistance! and so let good offices go round for  
mankind are all of a family. For my own part, when  
I am employed in serving others, I d) not lenk upon  
myself as conferring favors, but as paying debts. In my  
travels, and since my settlement, I have receivetljnuoh  
kindness from men , to whom I shall never have an o p  
portunily of making the least direct return, and nunv  
berleaa mercies from God, who is infinitely above he  
ing benefitted by our services. For these kindneisess  
from men, I can , therefore, only show my gratitude to  
God, by a readiness to help his other children and my  
brethern, fori do not think that (hanks and oompli  
menip, though repeated weekly, can discharge our real  
obligations to each other, much less to eur Creator.  
&#x27;You will see in this my notion of good works: that  
I do not expect to merit Heaven by them. By Heaven,  
we understand a state of happiness, infinite in degree.  
and eternal in duration; we can do nothing to deserve  
such a reward, He that, fur giving a draught of water  
to a thirsty person, should expect to he paid with a  
great plantation, would bo modest in his demands, com  
pared with those who think they deserve Heaven for  
the little good they do on earth. Even the mixed im  
perfect pleasures we enjoy in this world, are rather  
from God&#x27;s goodness than our merit. How muoh more  
so the happiness of Heavent For my part, I have not  
he vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to expect it, or  
the ambition to desire it; but content myself in submit  
ting to the disposal of that God who made me, who  
has hitherto preserved and blessed me, and in whose  
lutlieny goodness l may well confide, that ho never  
will make ma miserable, and that the affliction I may at  
any time suffer may tend to my ber.efil.  
&quot;The faith you mention has doubtless its uie in the  
world. I do not desire to see it diminished, nor would  
1 desire to iee it lessened in any man. tiutl wish it  
ware more productive of good works than 1 have scon;  
I mean real good works works nf kindness, charity,  
mercy, and public apirii, no holyday keeping, sermon  
hearing, or reading, performing church ceremnr.ios, or  
making long prayers, filled with flatteries and compli­  
ments, despised even by wise men, and much less ca­  
pable of pleasing the Deity.  
&#x27;The worship of God is t duty, the learning&quot; and rea.  
ding may be useful; but if man rest in hearing &amp;. pray­  
ing, as too many do, it is as if the tree value itself on  
being wa&#x27;tsrsd, to i putting forth leaves, though it never  
produced any fruit.  
&quot;Our Good master thought loss of these outward ap.  
pearancea tnan many of his modern disciples. He pre­  
ferred the doers of his word to the heurors: the son  
that seemingly refused to obey his father, and yet obey­  
ed his cnmrnnndinents, to him that professed his readi­  
ness, but neglected his work. The heretical, char&#x27;.ti­  
ble,but orthodox prio6tand sanctified Levile, and those  
who gave food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, mid  
raiment to the naked, entertainment to the strangeii  
who never heard of his name, declares shall, in the last  
day, be accepted when those who cry Lordl LordI who  
value themselves on their faith, though great enough to  
perform miracles, hut have neglected good works, shall  
be neglected. He professed that he :amo nut to cill the  
righteous, but sinners to repentance; which implied his  
modest opinion that there were some, in his tune, so  
good that they needed notjhear, even for improvement;  
but now-a-days we have scarcely a little parson whu  
does not think it the duty of every man within his reach  
to sit under his petty ministration, and that, whoevor

perfectly in the manner and spirit  
of that great and worthy man.&quot;  
&quot;I&gt;iiiladi:i.!&#x27;IIia, June the 6th,1765.  
&quot;Dear Sir: I received your kind letter  
of the?.I instant, and am glad to hear that  
you increase in strength. 1 hope you will  
continue mending until you recover your  
former health and firmness. Let me know  
whether you continue the cold bath, and  
what * if&#x27;ct it has. As to the kindness you  
spoke of, I wish it could have been of more  
real service to you: that you would always  
be ready to serve any other person that  
imv need your assistance: and so let good

olliees go rouiiu--ior uiauKiuu arc an ui  
a family. For my own part, when I am  
employed in serving others, I do not look  
upon myself as conferring favors, but as  
paying debts. In my travels. amUsinre my  
settlement, I have received much kindness  
from men, to whom I shall never have an  
opportunity of making the least direct return,  
and numberless mercies from God,  
who is infinitely above being benefited by  
our services. For these kindnesses from  
men, I can, therefore, only show my g-atitnde  
to God, by a readiness to help his  
othcrciiiidrcn and my brethern; fori do not  
think that thanks and compliments, though  
repeated weekly, can discharge our real  
obligations to each oilier, much less to our  
Creator.  
&quot;You will see in this my notion of good  
works; that I do not expect to merit Heaven  
by them. Iiy Heaven, we understand  
a stale of happiness, infinite in degree, and  
eternal in duration; we can do nothing to  
deserve such a reward. lie that, for giving  
a dt aught of water to a thiisty person,  
should expect to be paid with a great plantation,  
would be modest in his demands,  
compared with those who think they deserve  
Heaven for the little good they do  
on earth. Even the mixed imperfect pleasures  
we erjoy in this world, are rather  
from God&#x27;s goodness than our mprit. How  
much more so the happiness of Heaven??  
  
I- or my part, I have not the vanity to think  
I deserve it, the folly to expect it, or the  
ambition to desire it, hut content myself in  
submitting to the disposal of that God  
who made me, who lias hitherto preserved  
and blessed me, and in whose fatherly  
goodness I may well confide, that he never  
will make me miserable, and that the  
affliction I may at any lime suffer may lend  
to my benefit.  
&quot;The faith you mention doubtless basils  
use in the world. 1 do not desire to see it  
diminished, nor would 1 desire to see it  
lessened in any man. IJiit I wish it were  
more productive ufgood works than 1 have  
seen; I mean real good works?works of  
kindness, charity, mercy, and public spirit,  
no holvdav-knenincr. sermon.benrimr. or  
  
reading, performing church ceremonies, or  
making long prayers, filled with flatteries

&quot; The worship of God is a duty, the  
learning and reading may be useful; btit.if  
man rest in hearing and praying, (as too  
many do,) it is as if the tree value itself on  
being watered, and putting- forth leaves,  
though it never produced any fruit.  
&quot;Our Good Master thought less of these  
outward appearances than many of his modern  
disciples. He preferred the doers of  
his word to t&#x27; hirers; the son that seemingly  
refused i !?cv his futher, and yet

DeAE ErR:. I received your kind lettef af  
I inst, and am gind to hear that you increase  
in sfrength I hope you will centinte mending  
until you rerover your former health and firm  
ness. Lot mhe khow whother you continbe  
the cold beth; the offoct it has. As to the keind­  
hess you epoke of, I wich it could have been  
ervice to you; that you would  
ly to serve some ther person,  
that may beed your assistance, anid so le  
offices go round; for, mankind re all of a fa  
t mmy own part, when I am employed  
in serving othars, I do not look upon mnyselt  
as cuniurting favore, but as paying debts. In  
my travels, and since tny sattlemant, I have  
receivod mnuch kindnees froin men, to e homn  
I shall never have an opportunity of tiaking  
 the lehat dirert return, and nhmberlers meg  
cius from God, who is infinitely above being  
by our gervices. For these kind.  
in men, I can only therefore show  
bls otude i God, by a readmness to help  
nof think that thanks and compliments, though  
ropeated weekly, can discharge our real obll­  
gation to each other, and much lees to aur  
CreaIor.  
You will ses in thie, my nation of good works;  
that I do not expoct to morit heaven by them.  
Hy hearen, we understand a state of happls  
ness, infinite in degree, and eternal in dura.  
tion; we can do nothing to deserve such a ra.  
raad. He, that, for giving a drast of water to  
a thirsly borzon, should expect to be pald with  
a groal plantation, would be mnodest in his da­  
mands, compared with thore who think they  
ve heaven for the little geed they de on  
if thore real  
lways be  
benefitted  
nesses frt  
carth. Even the mixed linperfect plensuras,  
we anjoy in this world, are rather from God&#x27;s  
goodness, than our merit; how much more se  
the happiness of beaven? For my part I have  
nat the vanity to think I desorve it, the folly  
to expect it, or the ambition to desire it; but  
content myself in submitting to the disposal  
of that God, who mads me, who has hitherto  
preserved and blossed me, and in whose fa  
therly goodness, I may woll confide, thet he  
never will make me misorable, and that the  
affliction, I may at any time suffor, may tend  
to my benefit.  
The faith you mentioned has doubtless its  
use in the world. I do not desirs to sce it di­  
minished, nor would I desire to soe it lessaned  
in any man; but I wish it were more produe­  
tive of good works than I have seon; I mean  
real good worke, works of kindness, charity,  
mnercy, and public spirit, no holyday-keoping,  
sermon-hoaring, or reading, performing church  
ceremonies, or making long prayers, filled  
with flattories and compliments, dospised even  
by wise men, and much less capable of pleas  
ing the Deity.  
The worship of God is a duty, the learning  
and reading may be usoful; bot if man rest in  
hearing and praying, (as too many do,) it is as  
if the tree value itself on being waterod, and  
putting forth leaves, though it nover produced  
any fruif.  
  
any fruif.  
Our Good Master thought less of these out­  
ward appearances than many of his modern  
disciples. He preferred the doers of his word  
to the hearers; the son that scemingly refused  
to obey his father, and yet perform his com­  
mandmonts, to him that proseseed his teadt­  
ness, but neglected his work. The heretical,  
but charitable, but orthodox priest and sancti.  
fied Levite, and thone who gave food to the  
hungry, drink to the thirsty, and raiment to  
the naked, entortainment to the stranger, whe  
nover heard of his name, be declares shall, in  
the last day, be accepted when those whe cry  
Lord! Lord! who value themselves on their  
faith though great enough to perform miracles,  
but have neglected good works, shall be neg­  
lected. He professed that, he came not to call  
the righteous, but sinnors to repentance, which  
implied his modest opinion, that thare were  
some in his time so good, that they needed not  
to hear for improvements; but now-a-daye,  
we have scarcoly a little parson who does ne  
 think it the duty of every man within his reach  
to sit under his petty administration, and that,  
whoever omits this, offands God. I wish to  
such more humility, and to you health and  
firmness. Esing your friend and servant,

“Dear Sir. Iregeived your kind letier of the 2d

you recover your furmer health and firmness. Let me  
  
the

effect it has. As to the kindgess you spoke of, I wish  
it could have been of more real service to you ; that  
you would always he ready 9 serve any other person  
that may. need your assistance ; and so let good of  
fices go round—for mankind are allof afamily. For  
my own part,.when | ain employed in serving others.

the least direct return, and numberless mercies from  
God, whi is infinitely above being benefited by serv-

only show my gratiivde to God, by readiness to his  
other.children and my brethren ; for I donot think  
thatthanks and compliments,though repeated weekly  
can discharge our real obligations to each other, much  
lesa to,our creator.  
  
“You will.see in this amy notion of good works ;  
that I donot expect to merit Heavep by them.» By  
heaven, we understand a state of happiness, infinite  
in degree, and eternal in duratian ; we can do nothing  
  
to deserve sucha reward, He ahat. for giving a  
  
draught of water to athirsty person, should expect to |  
  
be paid with a great plantation, would be modest in  
his dem nds, compared with those whe think they  
deserve Heaven forthe lithe good they do on earth.  
Even the anixed imperfect pleasures we enjay in this  
world are rather from God&#x27;s goodness than our merit.  
How much more so the happiness Uleaven? For

in strength; I hope you will continue mending  
till you recover veur former health and firmnéss.

opportunity of making the least direct return ;  
and numberless mercies from God, who is infin-

piness of heaven! For my part, I have not the  
vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to expect it,  
nor the ambition to desire it ; but content myself  
submitting ‘to the will and disposal of that God  
who made me, who has hitherto preserved and  
blessed me, and in whose fatherly goodness I  
may well confide that he will never make me  
miserable; and that even the afflictions I may at  
any time suffer, shall tend to my benefit.  
  
The faith you mention has certainly its use in  
the world ; and I do not desire to see it diminish-  
ed, nor would I endeavor to lessen it in any  
man. But I wish it were more productive of  
good works than I have generally seen it. I  
mean real good works ; works of kindness, cha-  
rity, mercy, and public spirit; no holyday-keep-  
ing, sermon-hunting, or hearing; performing  
church ceremonies,or making long prayers, filled  
with flatteries and compliments. despised even  
by wise men, and much less capable of pleasing  
the Deity.  
  
The worship of God isa duty. The hearing  
and reading of sermons may be useful; but if  
men rest in hearing and reading and praying, as  
too many do, it is as if a tree should value itself  
on being watered and putting forth leaves, though  
it never produced any fruit. Your great Mas-  
ter thought much less of these outward appear-  
ances and professions than many of his modern  
disciples. He preferred the doers of the word  
to the mere hearers; the son that seminglv re-  
fused to obey his father, and yet performed his  
commands, to him that professed his readiness  
but neglected the work ; the heretical but charit-  
able Samaritan, to the uncharitable thouch ortho-  
dox Priest and sanctified Levite: and those who  
gave food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty,  
raiment to the naked, entertainment to the strang-  
er, and relief to the ‘sick, thongh they never  
heard of his name, he declares shall in the last  
day be accepted; when those whocry, Lord!  
Lord! who value themselves upon their faith,  
though great enough to perform miracles, but  
have neglected good works, shall be rejected.  
  
He professed that he came not to call the right-  
eous, but sinners, to repentance ; which implied  
his modest opinion that there were some in his  
time who thought themselves so good that they  
need not hear even him for improvement; but  
now-a-days we have scarce a little parson that  
does not think it the duty of every man within  
his’ reach to sit under his petty ministrations ;  
and whoever omits them offends God. I wish  
to such more humility, and to you, health, and  
happiness ; being your friend and servant,

Philadelphia, June oth, 1753.  
Dear Sir : I received your kind letter of the  
2d instant and am glad to hear you increase in  
sirength. I hope you will continue mending  
till you recover your former health and firmness.  
Let me know whether you still use the cold  
bath and what effect it has.  
As to the kindness you mention, I wish it  
could have been of more service to you, but if  
it had, the only thanks that I should desire is,  
ihat you would be equally ready to servean y other  
person that may need your assistance, and so let  
good offices go round ; for mankind are all of a  
family.  
For my own part, when I am employed in  
serving others, 1 do not look upon myself as  
conferring favors, but as paying debts. In my  
travels and since rny settlement, I have received  
much kindness from men to whom 1 Rhall never  
have an opportunity to make the least direct re­  
turn ; and numberless mercies from God, who  
is infinitely above being benefitted by our servi­  
ces. These kindnesses from men, I can only  
return on their fellow men ; and I can only 6how  
my gratitude for these mercies from God by a  
raediness to help his other children nnd my  
brethren ; for I do not think that thanks aud  
compliments, though repealed meekly, can dis­  
charge our real obligations to each other, and  
much less those to our Creator.  
You will in this see my notions of good  
works, and that I am far from expecting Heaven  
by there. By Heaven we understand a state of;  
  
happiness, infinite in degree and eternal in dura­  
tion. I can do nothing to deserve such rewards.  
He that for giving a draught of water to a thirs­  
ty person should expect lo be paid with a gooj  
plantation, would be modest in his demands,  
compared with those who think they des rva  
Heaven by the good they do on earth. Even  
the mixt, imperfect pleasures we enjoy in this  
world, are rather from God&#x27;s goodness than our  
merit&quot;; how much more so then the felicity of  
Heaven! For my own part I have not the  
vanit to think I deserve it, the folly to expect,  
nor the ambition 10 desire it ; but content my­  
self in submitting to the will and disposal of  
  
! II mi that made nie, who has hitherto preserved  
i and blessed me, and in whose paternal goodness  
j I may well confide, that he will never make me  
I miserable, and that even the afflictions&quot; I may at  
j any time suffer shall tend to my benef-t.  
I Your great Master thought much less of these  
I outward appearances and professions t.ianmany  
of his modern disciples; he preferred the doer  
&#x27; to the mere hearers ; the son who seemingly re  
fused to obey his father, and yet performed hi  
cominandi, to him who professed his readiness  
and yet neglected the work ; the heretical  
though charitable Sama&#x27;ttan, to the uncharitable  
though sanctified priest, and those who gave  
foodlo the hungry, drink to the thirsty, raiment  
to the naked, entertainment to the Stranger, and  
relief to the sick, though ihey never heard of  
his name, he declares shall he in the last day ac­  
cepted, when those who cry Lord, Lord, who  
value themselves on their faith, though great  
enough to perform miracles, but have neglected  
to perform the works of benevo ence, shall be  
rejected.  
The faith you mention, has doubtless its use  
in the world. I do not desire to see it dimin­  
ished, nor would I lessen it in any man; but I  
wish it was more productive of good works,  
works of kindness, cha.-ity, mercy and public  
spirit; not holiday-keeping, sermon reading; or  
having performed church ceremonies, or making  
loriJ prayers filled with flatteries and compli­  
ment&quot;, despised even by wise men, and much  
less Oapable of pleasing the Diety. The wor­  
ship of God is a duty, the hearing or reading  
sermons may be usc-fui ; but if a man rest in  
hearing or praying as too many do, it is as if a  
tree should value itself upon being watered and  
pulling forth leaves, though it never produced  
any fruit

PhitADEieHIA, JeNe 6, 1753  
Sis. I received your kind letter of the 2d  
inst. and am glad to hear that you increase in  
strength. I hope you will continue mending  
antil you recover your former health and fir  
ness. Let me know whether you still use the  
  
cold bath, and what effect it has  
As to the kiodness you mention, I wish it  
could have been of more service to you. But  
if it had, the only thanks that I should desire  
is, that you would alw ays be equally ready to  
serve any other person that may need your  
assistance, and so let good offices go round;  
for mankind are all of a family.  
For my own part, when I am emploved in  
serving others, I do not look upon myself as  
conserring favors, but as paying debts. In  
my travels, and since my settlement, I have  
received much kindness from men, to whom I  
shall never have an opportonity of making  
the last direct return; and numberless mer­  
sies from God, who is infinitely above  
benefitted by our services. These kinduesses  
from men, I can therefore only return on their  
fellow men, and I can also show my gratitude  
for those mercics from God, by a readiness to  
help his other children, and my brethren; for  
I do not think that thanks and compliments,  
though repeated weekly, can discharge our  
real obligations to each other, and much less  
those to our Creator. You will see in this  
my notion of good works, that I am far from  
evpecting to merit heaven by them. By  
heaven, we understand a state of happiness,  
infinite in degree and eternal in duration; I  
can do nothing to deserve such rewaids. Il  
that, for giving a draught of water to a thirsty  
person, should expect to be paid with a good  
plantation, would be modest in his demands,  
compared with those who think they deserve  
leaven for the little good they do on earth.  
Even the mixed, imperfect pleasures s  
in this world, are rather from God&#x27;s goodne  
than our merits; how much more such hap-  
piness of heaven! For my part I hats  
the vanity to think I deserved it, the folly to  
expect it, nor the ambition to desire it; but  
content myself in submitting to the will of  
that God who made me, who has hithe ro pi  
served and blessed me, and in whose fatherly  
roodness I may well confide, that he will a  
er make me miscrable and that even the af­  
fliction that I may at any time suffrshall tend  
  
to my beneft  
The faith you mention has, doubttess, its  
ise in the world, I do not desire to see it  
minished, nor would I endeavor to lessgn it  
any way. But I wish it were more pres  
tive of good works than I have generally see  
it; I mean real good works, works of kind­  
ness, charity, mercy, and public spirit; not  
holiday keeping, sermon reading or hearing.  
performing church ceremoules or making los  
prayers, filled with flatteries and compliments  
despised even by wise men, and much less ca­  
pable of pleasing the Deity. The worship  
of God is a duty; the hearing and reading of  
sermons may be useful; but if men rest in  
hearing and praying, as too many do, it is as  
if a tree should value itself on being watered  
and putting forth leaves, though it never pro­  
duced any frult  
Your great Master thought much less of  
these outward appearances and professions,  
than many of his modern disciples. He pre­  
erred the deeds of his hearers; the son that  
seemingly refused to obey his father, and yet  
performed his commands, to him that profes­  
sed his readiness, but neglected the work,  
the heretical but charitahle Samaritan to il  
ncharitable though orthodox priest, and sane­  
tified Levite; and those who gave food to the  
hungry, drink to the thirsty, raiment to the  
stranger, and relief to the sick, though they  
never heard his name, he declares shall in the  
last day be accepted; while those who cry  
Lord! Lord! who value theiselves upon their  
faith, though great enough to perform mira­  
cles, but have neglected good works, shall be  
rejected. He professed that he cune not to  
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;  
which implied his modest opinion, that there  
were some in his time who thought them­  
selves so good that they needed not to hear  
him, even for improvement; but now-a-days  
we have scarce a little parson that does not  
think it the duty of every man within h  
reach to sit under his petty ministration- and  
that whoever omits it, offends God. I wish  
to such, humility, and to you, health and hap­  
 being your friend and servant,

Philadelphia, June 6,1758.  
Dear Sin—I received your kind letter |  
of the 2d msK, aud am glad to hear that  
you increase in strength. I hope you will  
continue mending until you recover your  
former health and firmness. LetinekiKjVr

mention, I wish it could have been of more  
serious service to you; but if it had, the  
only thanks I should desire are that you  
should be ready to serve any other person  
tliaf.may need your assistance; and so let  
good offices go round, for mankind are all  
of a family. For my own part when I  
am employed in serving others, I do not  
look upon myself ns conferring favors hut  
paying debts. In my travels,artd since ray  
settlement, I have received much kind­  
ness front men to whom I shall never have  
an opportunity of ntakig the least direct  
return, and numberless mercies from God,  
who is infinitely above being henefitted by  
our services. These kindnesses from man I  
can only return to their follow-men ; and I  
can only show gratitude to God by aread­  
iness to help his other children, and my  
brethren, for I do not think that thanks and  
compliments, though repeated weekly, can  
discharge our real obligations to each other  
nnd much less to our Creator. You will  
see by my notion of good works, that I  
am far from expecting heaven by them.  
By heaven wo understand a state of happi­  
ness infinite in degree afid endless in dura­  
  
lion.  
I can do nothing to deserve such a re­  
ward. He that for giving a draught of  
water to a thirsty person should expect to  
be paid with a good plantation, would he  
modest in his demands compared with  
those who think they deserve heaven, for  
the little good they do on earth. Even the  
mixed, imperfect pleasure we enjoy in this  
world, is rather from God’s goodness than  
our merit; how much more so the happi­

Philadelphia, dune 6 th, 1853.  
Dear Sir,—I received your letter of the  
2d inst., aud am glad to hear that you in­  
crease iu strength. 1 hope you will continue  
mending, until you recover your former  
health uud firmness. Let n.e kuow whether  
•you still use the cold bath, and also what ef­  
fect it has. As to the kindness you mention,  
1 wish it could have been of more serious ser­  
vice to you; but if it hud, the only thauks 1  
should desire, are, that you would always be  
ready to serve any other person that may­  
need your assistauce; and so let good offices  
go round, for mankiud are all of a family.—  
For my own part, when I am employed iu  
serving others, I do not look upon myselt as  
conferring favors, but paying debts. In my  
  
travels, aUU uijf cviMwuiva.j * ~  
cuived much kiudness fr mi meu to whom I  
shall never have au opportunity of mukiDg  
the least direct return, and numberless mer­  
cies from God, who is iufinitely above bu.ig  
Irene fitted by our services. These kindnesses  
from man I can therefore only return to their  
fellow men; and 1 can only show gratitude to  
God by a readiness to foeip bis other children,  
vssd my brethren, for 1 do n^st think that  
thanks and compliments, thuugh repeated  
weekly, can discharge out real obligation to  
each other, and much less to our Creator.  
You will see by my notion of good works,  
that I am far from expecting heaven by them.  
By heaven, we understand a state ot happi­  
ness infinite in degree and endless in duration.  
I can do nothing to deserve such a reward.  
Jfe that for giving a draught of water to a  
(thirsty person, should expect to Le paid with  
;a good plantation, would be modest in his de  
Wands, compared with those who think they  
deserve heaven for the little good they do on  
earth. Even the mixed, imperfect pleasure  
we enjoy in this world, is rather from God’s  
goodness, than our merits, bow much more  
so the happiness of heaven! For my own part,  
I have not the vauity to think I deserve it—  
but content myself in submitting to the-dis­  
posal of that God who made, aud who has  
hitherto preserved and blessed me, and in  
whose Fatherly goodness I may well confide,  
that he never will make me miserable, and  
the afflictions I may at any time suffer may  
tend to my benefit. The faith you mention  
has, doubtless, its use in the world. I do  
pot desire to see it diminished, nor would I  
/endeavor to lessen it in any man; but I wish  
\t were more productive of wood works, than  
1 have generally seen it. 1 mean real good  
works—works of kindness, charity, mercy,  
end public spirit; not holiday-keeping, serm­  
on-reading or hearing, performing ohureh ce­  
remonies, or making long prayers filled with  
flattering and compliments, despised even by  
wise men, and much less capable of pleasing  
the Peitjt. The worship of God is a duty;  
  
the hearing and reading of sermons may be  
useful; but if men rest in hearing and pray­  
ing, as too many do, it is as if a tree should  
■ value itself on being watered aud&#x27;putting  
&#x27; forth leaves, though it never produced any  
■ fruit.  
Your great Master thought much less of  
these outward appearances and profession,  
than many of his modern disciples. He pre­  
j ferred the doers of the word to the mere  
J hearers; the sun that seemingly refused to  
i obey his father, and yet performed his com­  
mands, to him that professed his readiness,  
; but neglected the work; the heretical but  
charitable Samaritan, to the uncharitable  
I though orthodox priest and sanctifLd Lcvite;  
I aiid those who gave food to the hungry, drink  
to the thirsty, raiment to the naked, enter­  
tainment to the stranger, and relief to the  
sick, though they never heard of his name;  
I he declares shall in the last day bo accepted;  
■ when those who cry, Lord! Lord! v.ho value  
themselves upon their faith, though great en­  
ough to perform miracles, but have neglected  
good works, shall be rejected. He professed  
that he came, not to call the righteous, but  
sinners to repentance; which implied his mod­  
est opinion that there were some in his time  
so good, that they need not hear even him for  
improvement; but now-a-days we have scarce  
a little parson that does not think it the duty  
of every man withiu his reach to sit under  
his petty ministrations, and that whosoever  
: omits them offends God.  
| 1 wish to such more humility, and to you  
! health and happiness. 13. 1&#x27;uANKUK.

By Heaven we understand a state of happi­

kindness, charity, mercy and public spirit:  
not holiday keeping, sermon reuding or hear­

&quot;Sin: I received your kind letter of  
tho second instant, ami am jriud to hear  
That you increase in strength; I hope you  
vill continue mending till you recover  
our former lietilth and firmness. Let  
me know uhetlur you still use the cold  
Lath, and what e&#x27;lect it ha.s.  
An to the kindness you mention, I wish  
it could have been of more service to you.  
Hut if it had, the only thanks 1 should  
desire in that you would always be equally  
ready to serve any other person that may  
need your assistance, and so let good ofli­  
cos go round; for mankind are all of a  
family.  
For my own part, when I am employ­  
ed in serving others, 1 do not look upon  
myself ns conferring favors, but as pay­  
ing debts. Iu my travels, and since my  
settlement, I have received much kind­  
ness from men, to whom I shall never  
have any opportunity of making the least  
return and numberless mercies from God,  
who is infinitely abovw being benefited by  
our services. Those kindnesses from men,  
I can therefore only return on their fel­  
low men, and I can only show my grati­  
cule for these mercies from flod by a  
readiness to help his other children, and  
my brethren. For I do not think thanks  
and compliments, though repented week­  
ly, ran discharge our real obligations to  
each other, and much less those to our  
Creator. Vou will see in this my notion  
of good works, though I am far from ex­  
pecting to merit heaven by them. Uy  
heaven we understand a state of happi­  
ness, infinite in degree, and eternal in  
duration. I can d nothing to deserve  
such rewards. lie that for giving a  
draught of water to a thirsty person  
ihoul&#x27;,1 expect t&#x27; be paid with a good  
plantation, would be modest in hisdemands  
compared with those who think the)&#x27; de  
  
serve- heaven for the littlo crood they do  
on earth, l&#x27;ven the mixed, imperfect  
pleasures we enjoy in this &#x27;world are  
rather from (iod&#x27;s goodness than our  
merit; how much more such hapincss of  
heaven! For my part, 1 havo not the  
vanity to think 1 deserve it, the folly to  
expect it, nor the ambition to desire it;  
but content myself iu submitting to the  
will and disposal of that (od who made  
ine, who has hitherto preserved and bles­  
sed me, and iu whose fatherly goodness  
I may well confide, that he will never  
make mo miserable; and that c&#x27;cn the  
nfllictions I may at any time suffer shall  
tend to my benefit.  
. The faith you mention lias certainly  
its use in the world. I do not desire to  
see it diminished, nor would 1 endeavor  
to lessen it in any man. F.ut I wish it  
were more productive of good works than  
I havo generally seen it; I mean real  
good works; works of kindness, charity,  
mercy, and public spirit; notholiday-keeping,  
sermon-reading, or hearing, afid per­  
forming church cermonies, or making  
long prayers, filled with tlatteries and  
compliments despised even by wise men,  
and much less capablo of pleasing Deity.  
The worship of (Jod is a duty; the hear­

PHILADELPHIA, June 6, 1753   
  
Six: I received your kind letter of   
the gd instant, and am glad to hear that   
you increase in strength ; I hope you   
will continue mending, till you recover   
your former health and firmness. Let   
me know whether you still use the cold   
bath, and what effect it has.   
As to the kindness you mention, I   
wish it could have been of more service   
to you. But if it had, the only thanks   
I should desire is, that you would al­  
ways be equally ready to serve any othz   
er person that may need your assistancei   
and„so let good offices go round ; for   
mankind are all of one fah-lily.   
For my own part, when I am employ­  
ed in serving others, I do not look upon   
myself as conferring favours, but as   
paying debts. In my travels, and since   
my settlement, I have received much   
kindness from men, to whom I shall   
never have any opportunity of making   
the least (Urea return ; and numberless   
mercies from; God, who- is infinitely   
above being benefited by our services.   
Those kindnses from men, I can there­  
fore only return to their fellow - men,   
and I can only show my gratitude for   
these mercies( of God, by a readiness to   
help his other children, and my breth­  
ren. For I do not think that thanks   
and . compliments, though repeated   
weekly; can discharge our real obliga­  
tions to each other, and much less those   
to our Creator. You will see in this my­  
notion of good works, that I am liir   
from expecting to merit heaven by   
them. By heaven we understand a   
state of happiness, infinite in degree,   
and eternalAn duration : can do noth­  
ing to deserve such rewards. He that   
for giving a draught of water to a thirsty   
person, should expect to be paid with a   
good plantation, would be modest in;   
his demands, compared with thoSe who,   
think they deserve heaven for the little   
good they do on earth. Even the mist,   
itnperfect pleasures we enjoy in this   
world, are rather from God&#x27;s goodness­  
than our merit: how much more such)   
happiness of heaven! For my part Il   
have not the vanity to think I deserve&#x27;   
it, the folly to expect it, nor the ambi­  
tion to desire it; but content myself in   
submitting to the will and disposal of   
that God who made me, who has hith­  
erto preserved and blessed me, and in   
whose fatherly goodneis I may well con­  
fide, that he never will make me miser­  
able; and that even ,the afflictions I   
may at any time suffer shall tend to my   
benefit.   
  
The faith you mention ha certainly   
  
Its use in the world : Ido not desire to   
see it diminish, nor would I endeavour­  
to lessen it in any man. But I wish it   
were more productive of good works   
than I have generally seen it : I mean   
real good works ; works of kindness,   
charity, mercy, and public spirit; not   
holiday-keeping, sermon:rea ding or   
heaKing; .performing church ceremon­  
ies, or making long prayers, filled with   
flatteries and- compliments, despised,   
even by wise,men, and much less capa­  
ble of pleasing the Deity. The worship   
of God is a duty; the hearing and read-&#x27;   
&#x27;ing of sermons &#x27;may be useful ; but if   
men rest in hearing and pniying, as toe,   
&#x27;many do, it is as if a tree 4hould value&#x27;   
itself on being watered and putting forth 1   
leaves, though it never produced any   
fruit.   
i   
Your great aster thought much- less   
of these fout. d appearances and pkoß   
fessions, tha any of his modern dis­  
ciples. He p eferred the doers of the   
work, to the 4 ere hearers; the son that   
seemingly re used to obey his father   
and yet performed his commands, to   
him that professed his readiness, but   
neglected the work ; the heretical but   
charitable Samaritan, to the uncharita­  
,ble though orthodox priest, and sancti   
fled Levite ; and those who gave food   
to the hungry, drink to the thirsty,   
raiment to the naked, entertainthent to   
the&#x27; stranger, and relief to. the sick,   
though they never heard of his name,   
he declares shall in the last day be ac­  
cepted ; whenthose who cry Lord !   
Lord! who vale themselves upon their   
faith, though&#x27;great enough to perform   
miracles, but have neglected good works,   
shall be rejected., He professed that he   
came not to call the righteous, but sin­  
ners to repentance; which implied his   
modest opinion, that there were some   
in his time who thought themselves so   
good that they need not hear even him   
for improvement • but now-a-days we   
have scarce a littl person that does not   
, think it the duty f every man within   
&#x27;his reach to sit under his petty minis

Pim.AnKi.rniA, June. 0, 1753.  
Dkab 8ih : I received your kind lutter  
of the 74 instant, and am glad to bear  
that you increase lu strength. I hope  
you will continue menaing until you re­  
your former health and firmness.  
Let uic kaow whether you still use the I  
cold water bath and what effect It. has.  
As to the kindness you meution, I wish It  
could have been of more serious service  
to you ; but If it had, the only thanks I  
should desire are that you would always  
be ready  
may need your assista  
good offices go round ; for mankind  
ail of a family. For tny own pari, when  
I am employed in serving others, I do  
not look upon myself as conferring  
favors, but paying debts.  
In my travels and since my settlement,  
I have received much kindness from  
to whom I ßhall never have an opportu­  
nity of making the least direct return,  
and numberless mercies from God, who  
Is infinitely above being benefitted by  
services. These kindne&#x27;ses fr  
.therefore,only return to their fell«  
d I can only show my gratitude  
to God by a readluesa to help His other  
y brethren, fur I do not  
d eompllments,  
discharge  
each other, and  
•r. You will see  
ks that I am far  
expecting Heaven by them. By  
n we understand a stHte of happi­  
ness infinite In degree and endless in IP  
duration. I can do nothing to de  
ch a reward. He that for giving a  
draught of water to a thirsty person  
should expect to bo paid with a good  
plantation, would bo modest In his do­  
maud compared with tho.-e who think  
they deserve Heaven for the little good  
they do on earth. Even if the mixed,  
imperfect pleasures we enjoy in thU  
world, aie rather from God&#x27;s goodness  
than from our own uteri». ; how much  
the happiness of Heaven ? For  
my own part I have not the vanity to  
think I deserve It, but couteut myself in  
submitting to the disposal of that God  
who made and has hitherto preserved I  
, preserved and blessed, and in whose J  
* may Well confide, I  
uke me miserable,  
d the affliction I may ut any time sutler it  
may tend to my benefit. •  
The faith you mention has doubtless  
its use in the world. I do not desire to  
It diminished, nor would I desire to  
, but I wish it were  
irks than I  
real good  
ks of kindness, charity,  
mercy and public spirit, not holy-duy  
keeping, sermon hearing, or reading;  
performing ehur^h ceremonies or making  
long prayers, filled with flatteries and  
compliments, such as are eveu des­  
plsed by wise ineu, and much  
less capable of pleasing the  
Deity. The worship of flod Is a duty,  
the hearing and reading limy be useful ;  
but If men rest In bearing and praying,  
many do, &#x27;ils as if the tree should  
value itself on being watered and putting  
forth leaves, though it should never pro­  
duce any fruit.  
Your good Master thought much less  
of these outward appearances than many  
of His modern disciples. He preferred  
the doers of the word to hearers ; the son  
that seemingly refused to obey his  
father&#x27;s commands to him that professed  
his readiness but neglected bis work; the !

PHILADELPHIA, JunE 3, 1753.  
SIr: I received your kind letter of the 2d  
inst., and am glad to hear that you increase in  
strength. I hope you will continue mending  
till you recover your former health and firmness.  
Let me know whether you still use the cold  
bath, and what effect it has. As to the kindne  
you mention, I wish it could have been of  
greater service to you. But if it had, the only  
thanks I should desire is, that you would al-  
ways be equally ready to serve any other person  
that mav Beed your assistance, and so let good  
offices go round, for mankind are all of a family.  
for my own part, when I am employed in sery­  
ing others, I do not look upon myself as confer  
ring favors, but as paving debts.  
In my travels and since my settlement, I have  
received much kindness from men, to whom I  
shall never have any opportunity of making the  
least direct retuin, and numberless mercies  
from God, who is infinitely above being bene­  
fited by our services. Those kinnesses, Ir  
men I can therefore only return on their.  
men, and I can only show my gratitude for  
those mercles from God, by a readiness to help  
his other children and my brethren. For I dont  
think that thanks and compliments, though  
repeated weekly, can discharge our real obliga  
tion to each other, and much less those to our  
Creator. You will see in this my notion of good  
works, that I am fr from expecting to merit  
heaven by them. By heaven we understand a  
state of happiness infinite in degree and eternal  
in duration; I can do nothing to merit such re  
  
in duration; I can do nothing to merit suchr  
wards. He that for giving a draught of water to  
a thirsty person, should expect to be paid with a  
good plantation, would be modest in his de  
mands, compared with those who think they  
deserve heaven for the little good they do on  
earth. Even the mixed imperfect pleasures we  
enjoy in this world, are rather from God&#x27;s good  
ness than our merit! how much more such  
happiness of heaven! for my part, I have not  
the vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to ex-  
pect it, nor the ambition to desire it, but con  
tent myself in submitting to the will and dis­  
posal of that God who made me, who has hither.  
to preserved and blessed me, and in whose  
fatherly goodness I may well confide, that he  
will never make me miserable, and that even  
the afflictions I may at any time suffer, shall  
tend to my benefit.  
the fatth you mention has certainly its use in  
the world. I do not nesire to see it diminisued,  
nor would I endeavor to lessen it in any man.  
But I wish it were more productive of good  
works than I have generby seen it. I mean  
real good works, works of kindness, charity,  
mercy, and public starit; no holy-duys keening,  
sermon hunting or hearing, performing church  
ceremontes, making long prayers, filied with  
flatteries and compliments, despised even b  
wise men, and much less capable of pleasing the  
Deity. The worship of God is a uty. The  
hearing and reading of sermions may be useful;  
but if men rest in hearing and praying, as too  
many do, it is as if a tree should value  
itself on being watered and butting forth leaves,  
though it never produses frult. Yoor great Mas­  
ter thought much less of those out ward appear-  
ances and brofessions than many of his modern  
disciples. He prererred the doers of the word to  
the mere bearers; the son that seemincly refused  
to obey his father, and yet performed his com  
mands, to him that professed his readiness but  
neglected the work; the heritical but ehriable  
Samaritan to the uncheritable though orthodox  
priest and sanctifled Levite; and those who  
gave food to the hungry, Grink to the thirsty,  
raiment to the naked, entertamment to the  
tranger, and relief to the sick, though they  
never heard of his name, he declares shall in the  
last day be accepted, when those who cry Lord,  
Lord, who value themseives upon their faith,  
though great enougn to perform miracles but  
have neglecred good works, shull be rejected.  
He professed that he came not to call the  
righteous, but sinners, to repentance, which  
Impiled his modest optnion that there were  
some in his time who thought themselves so  
good that they did not hear even him for im  
provement; but now a days we have scarce a  
little parson that does not think it the duty of  
every man within his reach to sit under his petty  
ministrations, and whoever on its them offends  
Gon! I wish to such more humility, and to you  
health and happiness, being your friend and  
servant,.

Philadelphia, June C, 1753.—Sir: I  
received your kind letter of the 2d  
inst., and am glad to hear that you in­  
crease in strength. I hope you will  
continue mending till you recover  
your former strength and firmness.  
Let me know whether you still use the  
cold bath, and what effect it has. As  
to the kindness you mention, I wish it  
have been of greater service to  
you. But if it had, the only thank I  
should desire is, that you would always  
be equally ready to serve any other  
person that may need your assistance,  
and so let good offices go round, for  
mankind are all of a family. For my  
own part, when I am employed in  
seiving others, I do not look upon my­  
self as conferring favors, but as pay­  
ing debts.  
  
In my travels and since my settle­  
ment, 1 have received much kindness  
from men to whom I shall never have  
any opportunity of making the least  
direct return, and numberless mercies  
fiom God, who is infinitely above be­  
ing benefited by our services. Those  
kindnesses from men I can, therefore,  
only return on their fellow-men, and I  
can only show my gratitude for those  
mercies from God by a readiness to  
his other children and my breth­  
ren. For I don&#x27;t think that thanks  
and compliments, though repeated  
weekly, can discharge our real obliga­  
tion to each other, and much less those  
to our Creator. You will see in this  
my notice of good works, that I am  
far trom expecting to merit heaven by  
them. By heaven we understand a  
state of happiness infinite in degree  
and eternal in duration I can do noth­  
ing to merit such rewards. Ho that,  
for giving a draught of water to a  
thirsty person, should expect to be  
paid with a good plantation, would be  
modest in his demands, compared with  
those who think they deserve heaven  
for the little good they do on earth.  
Even the mixed imperfect pleasures  
we enjoy in this world, are rather from  
God&#x27;s goodness than our merit! How  
much more such happiness of heaven!  
For my part, I have not the vanity to  
think I deserve it, the folly to expect it,  
nor the ambition to desire it, but con­  
tent myself in submitting to the will  
and of that God who made me,  
has hitherto preserved and bless­  
ed me, and in whose fatherly goodness  
I may well confide, that he will never  
make me miserable, and that even the  
affljctionsl mayat any time suffer shall  
tend to my benefit.  
  
The faith you mention has certainly  
its use in the world. I do not desire  
to see it diminished, nor would I en­  
deavor to lessen it in any man. But I  
wish it were more productive of good  
works than I have generally seen it. I  
mean real good works, works of kin  
ness, charity, mercy, and public spirit  
holy-day keeping, sermon-hunting  
or healing, performing Church cere  
monies, making long prayers, filled  
withflatteriesand compliments, des  
  
fessd  
  
use even by wise men, and much  
capable ot pleasingthe Deity. The  
worship of God is a duty. The hear  
ing and reading of sermons may be  
useful but if men rest in hearing and  
praying, as too many do, it is as if a  
tree should value it on being watered  
and putting foith leaves, though it  
never produces fruit. Your greatMas­  
ter thought much less of those out­  
ward appearances and professions than  
many ot his modern disciples. He  
preferred the doers of the word to the  
mere hearers the son that seemingly  
refused to obey his father, and per­  
formed his commands, to him that  
professed his readiness but neglected  
his work the heretical but charitable  
Samaritan to the uncharitable though  
orthodox priest and sanctified Levite  
and those who gave food to the hungry,  
to the thirsty, raiment to the  
naked, entertainment to the stranger,  
and relief to the sick, though they  
never heard of his name, he declares  
shall in the last day be accepted, when  
those who cry Loid, Lord, who value  
themselves upon their faith, though  
great enough to perform miracles but  
have neglected good works, shall be re­  
jected.  
  
He professed he came not to call the  
righteous, but sinners, to repentance,  
which implied his modest opinion that  
there were some in his time who  
thought themselves so good that they  
did not hear even him for improve­  
ment but nowadays we have scarce a  
little parson that does not think it the  
duty of every man within his reach to  
under his petty ministrations, and  
whoever omits them offends God! I  
  
wish to such more humility, and jto  
you health and happiness, being your  
friend and servant, B.  
  
FRANKLIN.

PHIlADELPHIA, JunE 6, 1753.  
Sin: I received your kind letter of the  
2d inst., and am glad to hear that you  
ncrease in strength. I hope you will  
continue mending till you recover your  
former houlth and firmness. Let me know  
whether you still use the cold bath, and  
what effect it has. As to the kindness  
you mention, I wish it could have been  
of greater service to you. But if it had  
the only thanks I should desire is, that  
you would always be equally ready to  
serve any other person that may need  
your assitance, and so let good offices go  
tound, for mankind are all of a fami&#x27;.  
  
For my own part when I am employed  
in serving others, I do not look upon my-  
self as confering favors, but as paying  
debts. In my travels and since my set-  
tlement, have received much kindness  
from men, to whom I shall never have any  
opportunity of making the least direct  
return, and numberless mercies from God,  
who is infinitely above being benefited  
by our services. These kinlnesses from  
men I can therefore only return on their  
lellow men, and I can only show my grat  
itude for those mercies from God, by a  
readiness to help his other children and  
my brethren. For I don&#x27;t think that  
thanks and compliments, though repeeate  
ed weekly, can discharge our real obliga­  
tion to each other, and much less those to  
our Crentor. You will see in this my  
notion of good works, that I am far from  
expecting to merit heaven by them. By  
heaven we understand a state of happi-  
ness infinite in degree and eternal in du­  
ration; I can do nothing to merit such re  
wards. He that for giving a draught of  
water to a thirsty person, should expect  
to be paid with a good plantation, would  
be modest in his demands, compared  
with those who think they deserve heaven  
tor the little good they do on carth.  
Even the mixed imperfect pleasures we  
enjoy in this world, are rather from God&#x27;s  
ghodness than our merit! how much more  
such happiness of heaven! for my part I  
have not the vanity to think I deserve it,  
the folly to expect it nor the ambition to  
desire it, but content myselt in submitt  
ing to the will and disposal of that God  
who made me, who has hitherto preserv-  
ed and blessed me and in whose fatherly

never make me miserable, and that even  
the aflictions I may at any time suffer.  
shall tend to my benefit.  
The faith you mention has certainly its  
use in the world. I do not desire to see  
it diminished, nor would I endeavor to  
lessen it in any man. But I wish it were  
more productive of good works than I  
have generally seen it. I mean real good  
works, works of kindness, charity, mercy  
and public spirit; no boly-days keeping,  
sermon-hunting or hearing, performing  
church ceremonies, making long prayers,  
filled with flatteries and compliments,  
despised even by wiso men, and much  
fseie in  
worship of God is a duty. The hearing  
and reading of sermons may be useful;  
but if men rest in hearing and praying.  
as too many do it is as if a tree should  
value itself on being watered and putting  
forth leaves, though it never produces  
fruit. Your great Master thought much  
less of those outward appearances and  
professions than many of his modern dis­  
ciples. He prefered the doers of the  
word to the mere learers; the son that  
seemingly refused to obey his farher, and  
yet performed his commands, to him that  
professed his readiness but neglected the  
work; the heritical but charitable Samal­  
itan to the uncharitable though orthodox  
priest and sanctified Levite; and those  
who gave food to the hungry, drink to  
the thirsty, raiment to the naked, enter­  
tainment to the stranger, and relief to  
the sick, though they never heard of his  
name he declares shall in the last day be  
accepted, when those who cry Lord, Lord,  
who value themselves upon their faith,  
though great enough to perform miracles  
but have neglected good works, shall be  
rejected. He professed that he came not  
to call the righteous, but sinners, to re­  
pentance, which implied his modest opin  
ion that there were some in his me  
who thought themselves so good that  
they did not hear even him for improve­  
ment; but now a days we have scarce a  
little parson that does not think it the  
duty of every man within his reach to  
sit under his petty ministrations, and  
whoever omits them offends God! I wish  
to such more humility, and to you health  
and happiness, being your triend and  
servant.B. FRANKLIN

Philadelphia, June G, 1753.  
Sir: I received your kind letter  
of the 2d inst., and am glad to hear  
that you increase in strength. I hope  
you will continue mending till you  
recover your former health and firm­  
ness. Let me know whether jou  
still use the cold bath and what effect &#x27;  
it has. As to the kindness you men- !  
tiou, I wish it could have been of  
greater service to yon. But if it had,  
tho only thanks I should desire is,  
that you would always be equally !  
ready to serve any other person that  
may need your assistance, and so let  
good oftlces go round, for maukind  
aro all of a family. For my own  
part, when I am employed in serving  
others, I do not look upon myself as  
conferring favors, but as paying  
debts.  
In my travels and since my settle­  
ment, I have received much kindness  
from nieu, to whom I shall never  
have any opportunity of making the  
least direct return, and numberless  
mercies from God, who is infinitely  
above being benefited by our ser­  
vices. Those kindnesses from men  
I can therefore only return on their  
fellow men, and I can only show my  
gratitude for those mercies from God  
by a readiness to help his other chil­  
dren and my brethren. For 1 don&#x27;t  
think that thanks and compliments,  
though repeated weekly, can dis­  
charge our obligation to each other,  
and much less those to our Creator.  
You will see in this my notion of  
good works, that I am far from ex­  
pecting to merit heaven by them.  
By heaven we understand a state of  
happiness infinite in degree and eter­  
nal in duration; I can do nothing to  
merit such rewards. He that, for  
giving a draught of water to a thirsty  
person, should expect to be paid  
with a good plantation, would be  
modest in his demand, compared  
with those who think they deserv  
heaven for the little good they do on  
earth. Even the mixed imperfect  
pleasures we enjoy in this world, are  
rather from God&#x27;s goodness than our  
merit! how much more such happi­  
ness of heaven! for my part, I have  
not the vanity to think I deserve it.  
the folly to expect it, nor the ambition  
to desire it, but content myself with  
submitting to the will and disposal  
of that God who made me, who has  
hitherto preserved and blessed me,  
and in whose fatherly goodness I  
may well confide, that he will never  
make me miserable, and that even  
the afijictions I may at any time suffer  
snail tend to my benefit.  
iue faith you mention has certainly  
its use in the world. I do not desire  
to see it diminished, nor would I  
endeavor to lessen it in any man.  
But I wish &quot;it. were more iiroductire  
SO&quot;&quot;- works than 1 have generally  
seen it. I mean real good works,  
works of kindness, charity, mercy  
and public spirit; no holy-days keep­  
ing, sermon hunting or hearing, per­  
forming church ceremonies, making  
long prayers, filled with flatteries  
and compliments, despised eveu by  
wise men, and much less capable of  
pleasing the Deity. The worship of  
God is a duty. The hearing and  
reading of sermons may be useful;  
but if men rest in hearing and prayr  
ing, as too many do, it is as if a tree  
should value itself on being watered  
and putting forth leaves, though it  
never produces fruit, Your great  
Master thought much lass of those  
outward appearances and professions  
than many of his modern deoiples.  
He preferred the doers of the word  
to the mere hearers; the son that  
seemingly refused to obey his father  
and yet performed his commands to  
him that professed his readiness but  
neglected the work; the herietcal&#x27;but  
charitable Samaritan to the unchar­  
itable though orthodox priest and  
sanctified Levite; and those who gave  
food to the hungry, drink to the  
thirsty, raiment to the naked, enter­  
tainment to the stranger, and relief  
to the sick, though they never heard

last day be accepted, when those who  
cry Lord, Lord, who value them­  
selves upon their faith, though great  
enough to perform miracles but have  
neglected good works, shall berejected.  
  
He professed that he came not to  
oll tbn rifrli Iam. X i. - .  
i5uicuus, hud sinners, to  
repentance, which implied his modest  
opinion mac there were some in his

that they did not hear ptpii liim for  
improvement; but now-a-days we  
nave scarce a little parson that does  
not think it the duty of every man

Philadelphia, June G, 1753.  
Sir : I received your kind letter of the 2d  
inst., nnd am glad to hear that you increaso  
in strength. I hope you will continue  
mending till you recover your former  
health and firmness. Let me know whether  
you still use the cold bath, and what effect  
it has. As to the kindness you mention, I  
wish it could have been of greater service  
to you. But if it had, the only thanks I  
should desire is, that you would always be  
equally ready to serve any other person  
that may need your assistance, and so let  
good offices go round, for mankind are all  
of a family. For my own part, when I am  
employed in serving others, I do not look  
upon myself as conferring favors, but as  
paying debts.  
In my travels nnd since my settlement, I  
have received much kindness from men, to  
whom I shall never have any opportunity  
of making the least direct return, and num­  
berless mercies from God, who is infinitely  
above being benefited by our services.  
Those kindnesses from men lean therefore  
only return on their fellow-men, nnd I can  
only show my gratitude for those mercies  
from God, by a readiness to help his other  
children and my brethren. For I don’t  
think that thanks and compliments, though  
repeated weekly, can discharge our real ob­  
ligation to each other, nnd much less those  
to our Creator. You will see in this my  
notion of good works, that I am far from  
expecting to merit heaven by them. By  
heaven we understand a state of happiness  
infinite in degree and eternal in duration;  
I can do nothing to merit such rewards.  
He that for giving a draught of water to a  
thirsty person, should expect to bo paid  
with a good plantation, would bo modest in  
his demands, compared with those who  
think they deserve heaven for the little good  
they do on earth. Even the mixed imper­  
fect pleasures we enjoy in this world, are  
rather from God’s goodness than our merit!  
how much more such happiness of heaven!  
for my part, I have not the vanity to think  
I deserve it, the folly to expect it, nor the  
ambition to desire it, but content myself  
in submitting to the will and disposal of  
that God who made me, who has hitherto  
preserved and blessed me, and in whose  
fatherly goodness I may well confide, that  
he will never rnnke me miserable, and that  
even the afflictions I mayjat any time suffer,  
shall tend to ray benefit.  
The faith you mention has certainly its  
use in the world. I do not desire to see it  
diminished, nor would I endeavor to lessen  
it in any man. But I wish it were more  
productive of good works than I have gen­  
erally seen it. I mean real good works,  
works of kindness, charity, mercy, nnd pub­  
lic spirit; no holy-days keepiag, sermon­  
huntipg or hearing, performing church cer­  
emonies, making long prayers, filled with  
flatteries and compliments, despised even  
by wise men, and much leas capable of  
pleasing the Deity. The worship of God  
is a duty. The hearing and reading of ser­  
mons may be useful; but if men rest in  
hearing and praying, as too many do, it is  
as if a tree should value itself on being  
watered and putting forth leaves, though it  
never produces fruit. Your great Master  
thought much less of those outward appear­  
ances and professions than many of his  
modern disciples. He preferred the doers  
of the word to the mere hearers; the son  
that seemingly refused to obey his father,  
and yet performed his commands, to him  
that professed his readiness but neglected  
the work; the hcritical but charitable Sa­  
maritan to the uncharitable though ortho­  
dox priest and sanctified Levite; and those  
who gave food to the hungry, drink to the  
thirsty, raiment to the naked, entertain­  
ment to the stranger, and relief to the sick,  
though they never heard of his name, he  
declares shall in the last day be accepted,  
when those who cry Lord, Lord, who value  
themselves upon their faith, though great  
enough to perform miracles but have neg­  
lected good works, shall be rejected.  
He professed that he came not to call the  
righteous, but sinners, to repentance, which  
  
implied his modest opinion that there were  
some in his time who thought themselves  
so good that they did not hear even him for  
; improvement; but now a dnys wo have  
scarce a little parson that does not think it  
the duty of every man within his reach to  
sit under liis petty ministrations, and who­  
ever omits them offends God! I wish to  
such more humility, and to you health and  
i happiness, being your friend and servant,  
B. Franklin

Sir: I received your kind letter  
ot the 2d Inst., and am glad to hear  
that you increase : in strength. I  
hope you will continue mend ins till  
you recover your former health and  
firmness. Let me know whether  
you still use the cold hath, and  
what effect it nas. As totne Kind  
ness you mention, I wish it could  
have been of greater service to you.  
But if it had, the only thanks I  
should desire is, that you would al  
ways be equally ready to serve any  
other person : that may need your  
assistance, and so let good offices go  
round, ior mantino are an ot a ram-1  
Ily. For my own part, when 1 am  
employed in serving others, I do  
not look upon myself as conferring  
favors, but as paying debts.. ,  
In my travels and since my set&#x27;  
tlement, I have- received much  
Kindness from men, to whom 1  
shall never have any opportunity  
of making the least direct return,  
and numberless mercies from God,  
who is infinitely above being bene­  
fited by our services. Those kind  
nesses from men I can therefore only  
return on their fellow-men, and I  
can only show my gratitude tor  
those mercies from liod, by a readi  
ness to help his other children and  
my brethren, f or l don&#x27;t think  
that thanks and compliments,  
though repeated weekly, can dis­  
charge our obligation to each other,  
and much less those to our Creator.  
You will see in this my notion of  
good works, that I am far from ex-  
oectinff to merit neaven ov them.  
By heaven we understand a state of  
happiness mnnite in &#x27; degree and  
eternal in duration ; I can do noth­  
ing to merit such rewards. He that  
for giving a draught of water, to a  
thirsty person, should expect to be  
paid with a good plantation, would  
be modest in his demands, compared  
with those who think they deserve  
heaven for the little good they do  
on earth. Even the mixed imper­  
fect pleasures we enjoy in this  
world, are rather from God&#x27;s good  
ness than our merit! how much  
more such happiness of heaven!  
For my part, I have not the vanity  
to think I deserve it, the folly to  
expect it, nor the ambition to de  
sire it, but content myself in sub  
mitting to the will and disposal or  
that God who made me, who has  
hitherto preserved and blessed me,  
and in whose fatherly goodness I  
may well confide, that he will never  
make me miserable, and that even  
lha nfflirtinnq T mav ntnnvtime  
suffer, shall tend to my benedt. :  
The faith you mention has cer  
tainly its use in the world. I do  
not desire to see it diminished, nor  
would I endeavor to lessen it in any  
man. But I wish it were more pro  
ductive of good works than I have  
generally seen it. I mean real good  
works, works or Kindness, cnanty.  
mercy and public spirit; no holy-  
days keeping, sermon-hunting or

monies, making long prayers, filled

much less capable of pleasing the  
Deity. The worship of God is a  
duty. The bearing and reading of  
sermons may be useful; but if men  
rest in hearing and praying, as too  
many do, it is as if a tree should  
value itself on being watered and  
putting forth leaves, though it never  
produces fruit. Your great Master  
thought much less of those outward  
appearances- and &#x27; professions than  
many of his modern disciples. He  
preferred the doers of the word to  
the mere hearers; the son thatseem­  
inelv refused to obey his father, and

## [From _The Indianapolis leader._](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn84027490/1882-02-04/ed-1/?sp=3)

#### 1882-02-04 &middot; [Indianapolis, Ind.](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indianapolis)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Philadelphia, June G, 1753.  
Sir I received your kind letter of the 2d  
inst, and am glad to hear you increase in  
strength. I hope you will continue mend­  
ing till you recover your former health and  
firmness. Let me know whether you still use  
the cold bath and what effect it has.  
As to the kindness you mention, I wish it  
could have been of more service to you. But  
if it had, the only thanks I should desire is  
that you would always be equally ready to  
serve any other person that may need your  
assistance, and so let good offices go round,  
for mankind are all of a family.  
For ray own part, when I am employed  
in serving others, I do not look upon myself  
as conferring favors, but an paying debts.  
In my travels and since my settlement, I  
have received much kindness from men to  
whom I shall never have an opportunity of  
making the least direct return and num­  
berless mercies from God. who is infinitely  
above being benefited by our services.  
These kindnesses from men I can only re­  
turn as their fallow man. and I can only  
show my gratitude for these mercies from  
God by my readiness to help his other  
children and. my brethren. For I do not  
think that thanks and compliments, though  
repeated weekly, can discharge our real ob­  
ligations to each other, much less those to  
our Creator.  
You will in this see my notion of good  
works, and that I am far from expecting  
Heaven by them; by Heaven we understand  
a state or happiness infinite in degree and  
eternal in duration. lean do nothing to  
deserve such rewards. He, that for giving a  
draught of water to a thirsty person should  
expect to be paid with a good plantation,  
would be modest in his demand compared  
with those who think they deserve Heaven  
by the good they do on earth. Even the  
mixed, imtterfect pleasures we enjoy tre  
rather from God&#x27;s goodness than our merit.  
How much more so then the happiness o&quot;  
Hetven. For my own part, I have not the  
vanity to think I deserve it, the folly to ex  
pect it, nor the ambition to desire it, but  
content myself in submitting my future  
destiny to the will and disposal of Him who  
made, who has hitherto preserved me and  
blessed me, and in -whose fatherly care a d  
goodness I may well confide; that He will  
never make me miserable, and that even the  
afflictions I may at any time suffer shall  
turn to my benefit.  
The faith you mention has doubtless its  
uses in the world. I do not desire to see it  
diminished, nor would I endeavor to lessen it  
in any man, but I wish it was more produc­  
tive of good works works of kindness,  
charity, mercy, public spirit, not holiday­  
keeping, performing chu ch ceremonies, or  
making long prayers, filled with flatteries  
and compliments, despised even by wise  
men, and much less capable of pleasing the  
Piety. The worship of God is a duty. The  
hearing and reading of sermons may be use­  
ful. But if a man rests in hearing or pray  
ing, as too many do, it is as if a tree should  
value itself on being watered, and putting  
forth leave&#x27;, though it never produce any  
fruit.  
Our Great Master thought mnch less of  
the outward appearances and professions  
than many of Iiis modern disciples. He  
E referred the doers of the Word to the mere  
earers the son that seemingly reused to  
obey his father, and yet performed his com­  
mands, to him that professed his readiness  
and yet neglected his work. The charitable  
though heretical Samaritan to the unchar  
itable yet sanctified priest; and those who  
gave food to the hungry, drink to the  
thirsty, raiment to the naked, entertain­  
ment to the stranger and relief to the sick,  
though they never heard of His name, He  
declares shall in the last day be accepted,  
when those who cry Lord, Lord, who value  
themselves on their faith, though great  
enough to perform miracles, but have  
neglected good works, shall be rejected.  
He professed that He came not to call the  
righteous, but sinners to repentance, which  
implied His modest opinion that there were  
some in His time so good that they needed  
not fear even Him. Put in these days we  
have scarce a little parson who does not  
think it the duty of every man within his  
reach to sit under his petty ministrations,  
and whosoever omits them offends God. I  
wish to such more humility, and to you, sir,  
more health and happiness.  
Your most obedi.t and humb.le serv.t,  
- Benjm Fbahklix

charity, mercy, and publick spirit; not holi-  
day-keeping, sermon reading or hearing, per-  
forming church ceremonies, or making long  
prayers, filled with flatteries and compli-  
ments,—despis’d even by wise men, and  
much less capable of pleasing the Deity.  
The worship of God is a duty, the hearing  
and reading of sermons may be useful; but  
if men rest in hearing and praying, as too  
many do, it is as if a tree should value itself  
in being water’d and putting forth leaves,  
tho’ it never produc’d any fruit.”

one to immortality.  
  
For my own part [he wrote], when I am em-  
ployed in serving others, I do not look upon my-  
  
517  
  
self as conferring favours, but as paying debts.  
In my travels and since my settlement I have  
received much kindness from men, to whom I  
shall never have any opportunity of making the  
least direct return, and num-  
berless mercies from God, who  
is infinitely above being bene-  
fited by our services. These  
kindnesses from men I can  
therefore only return on their  
fellow-men; and I can only  
show my gratitude for those  
mercies from God, by a readi-  
ness to help his other children  
and my brethren. For I do  
not think that thanks and  
compliments tho’ repeated  
weekly, can discharge our  
real obligations to each other,  
and much less those to our  
Creator.  
  
You will see in this my  
notion of good works, that I  
am far from expecting (as  
you suppose) that I shall  
ever merit heaven by them.  
By heaven we understand a  
state of happiness, infinite in  
degree and eternal in duration.  
I can do nothing to deserve  
such reward. He that for  
giving a draught of water to  
a thirsty person should ex-  
pect to be paid with a good  
plantation, would be modest  
in his demands, compared with  
those who think they deserve  
heaven for the little good they  
do on earth. Even the mixed,  
imperfect pleasures we enjoy  
in this world are rather from  
God’s goodness than our  
merit; how much more such  
happiness in heaven. For my  
own part, I have not the van-  
ity to think I deserve it, the  
folly to expect it, nor the am-  
bition to desire it; but content  
myself in submitting to the  
will and disposal of that God  
who made me, who hitherto  
preserv’d and bless’d me, and  
in whose fatherly goodness  
I may well confide, that he  
will never make me miserable, and that even  
the afflictions I may at any time suffer shall tend  
to my benefit.  
  
This conviction is constantly reiterated i

As to the kindness you mention, I wish it could  
have been of more service to you [he told a  
friend]. But if it had, the only thanks I should  
desire is, that you would always be equally ready  
to serve any other person that may need your as-  
sistance, and so let good offices go round, for man-  
kind are all of a family.
