Whereas the Commissrs. who assembled at Annapolis on the 14th. day of Sepr. last for the purpose of devising and reporting the means of enabling Congress to provide effectually for the commercial interests of the U. States, have represented the necessity of extending the revision of the federal System to all its defects, and have recommended that deputies for that purpose be appointed by the several Legislatures to meet in Convention in the city of Philada. on the 2d. day of May next; a provision which seems preferable to a discussion of the subject in Congress, where it might be too much interrupted by the ordinary business before them, and where it would besides be deprived of the valuable counsels of sundry individuals who are disqualified by the Constitutions or Laws of particular States, or restrained by peculiar circumstances from a seat in that Assembly: And Whereas the General Assembly of this Commonwealth taking into view the actual situation of the Confederacy, as well as reflecting on the Alarming representations made from time to time by the U. S. in Congress, particularly in their Act of the [fifteenth] day of Feby. last, can no longer doubt that the crisis is arrived at which the good people of America are to decide the solemn question, whether they will by wise and magnanimous efforts reap the just fruits of that Independence which they have so gloriously acquired, and of that Union which they have cemented with so much of their common blood; or whether by giving way to unmanly jealousies and prejudices, or to partial and transitory interests they will renounce the auspicious blessings prepared for them by the Revolution, and furnish to its enemies an eventual triumph over those by whose virtue &amp; valour it has been accomplished: And Whereas the same noble and extended policy, and the same fraternal &amp; affectionate sentiments which originally determined the Citizens of this Commonwealth to unite with their brethren of the other States in establishing a federal Government, cannot but be felt with equal force now as motives to lay aside every inferior consideration, and to concur in such farther concessions and provisions as may be necessary to secure the great objects for which that Government was instituted, and to render the U. States as happy in peace as they have been glorious in war. Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and it is enacted by the authority of the same that ⟨[seven] commissioners be appointed by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly, who or any⟩ [three] ⟨of them⟩ be and they ⟨are hereby⟩ appointed and authorized as deputies from this Commonwealth to meet such deputies as may be appointed and authorized by other States, to assemble in Convention at Philada. as above recommended: and to join with them in devising and discussing all such alterations and further provisions as may be necessary to render the federal Constitution adequate to the exigences of the Union, and in reporting such an act for that purpose to the U. S. in Congress, as when agreed to by them, and duly confirmed by the several States, will effectually provide for the same. And the Governor is requested to transmit forthwith a copy of this Act to the U. S. in Congs. and to the Executives of each of the States in the Union.  
And Be it further enacted that in case of the death of any of the sd. deputies, or of their declining their appts. the Executive are hereby authorised to supply such vacancies

8 I HEREAS the Commiſſioners who aſſembled at Annapolis, on the fourteenth day of  
GS ROAR FN September laft, for the purpoſe of deviſing and reporting the means of enabling Congreſs to  
provide effectually for the Commercial Intefeſts of the United States, have repreſented the neceſſity of extending  
the reviſion of the Federal Syſtem to all its defects; and have recommended that Deputies for that purpoſe be ap-  
pointed by the ſeveral Legiſlatures, to meet in Convention in the City of Philadelphia, on the ſecond day of May  
next; a proviſion which ſeems preferable to a diſcuſſion of the ſubject in Congreſs, where it might be too much  
interrupted by the ordinary buſineſs before them, and where it would beſides be deprived of the valuable counſels  
of ſundry individuals, who are diſqualified by the Canſtitution or Laws of particular States, or reſtrained by  
peculiar circumſtances-from a ſeat in that Aſſembly: And whereas the General Aſſembly of this Commonwealth,  
taking into view the actual ſituation of the Contederacy, as well as reflecting on the alarming repreſentations  
made from time to time by the United States in Congreſs, particularly in their Act of the fifteenth day of February  
laſt, can no longer doubt that the criùs is arrived at which the good people of America are to decide the ſolemn  
queſtion, whether they will by wiſe and magnanimous. eftorts reap the juſt fruits of that independence, which the  
have fo gloriouſly acquired, and of that Union which they have cemented with ſo much of their common blood ;  
or whether by giving way to unmanly jealouſies and prejudices, or to partial and tranſitory intereſts, they will  
renounce the auſpicious bleſſings prepared for them by the Revolution, and furnith to its enemies an eventual  
triumph over thoſe by whoſe virtue and valour it has been accompliſhed : And whereas the fame noble and  
extended policy, and the ſame fraternal and affectionate ſentiments, which originally determined the Citizens of  
this Commonwealth to unite with their brethren of the other States in eſtabliſhing a Federal Government, cannot  
but be felt with equal force now, as motives to lay alide every inferior conſideration, and to concur in ſuch further  
conceſſions and proviſions, as may be neceſſary to ſecure the great objects for which that Government was  
inſtituted, and to render the United States as happy N as they have been glorious in war:  
  
SecT. II. BE it therefore enacted by the General Aſſembly of the Commontuealih of Virginia, That ſeven Com-  
miſſioners be appointed by joint ballot of both Houſes of Aflembly, who, or any three of them, are hereby autho-  
rized as Deputies from this Commonwealth, to meet ſuch Deputies as may be appointed and authoriſed by other  
States, to aſſemble in Convention at Philadelphia, as above recommended, and to join with them in deviſing and  
  
diſcuſſing all ſuch alterations and fur ther proviſions, as may be neceſſary to render the Federal Conſtitution adequate  
to the exigencies of the Union; and in reporting ſuch an Act for that purpoſe, to the United States in Congreſs,  
as, when agreed to by them, and duly confirmed by the ſeveral States, will effectually provide for the ſame.  
  
SECT. III. AND be it further enacted, That in caſe of the death of any of the ſaid Deputies, or of their  
33 their appointments, the Executive are hereby authoriſed to ſupply ſuch vacancies. And the Governor

recommended that deputies for that purpose lie appointed  
by the several legislature*, to meet in oonvention, in the

by giving way to nmnanly jealousies and prejudices, or  
to partial and transitory interests, they will renounce the  
auspicious blessings prepared for them by the revolution,

by whose virtue and valor it bas been accomplished j and
