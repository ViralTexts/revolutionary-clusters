[New York, July 14, 1804]  
  
On Saturday last the remains of Alexander Hamilton were committed to the grave with every possible testimony of respect and sorrow. That distant readers may form some idea of what passed on this mournful occasion, we shall here present them with a regular and correct account of the whole scene.  
The Military, under the command of Lieutenant Col. Morton, were drawn up in front of Mr. Church’s house, in Robinson-street, where the body had been deposited. On the appearance of the corpse it was received by the whole line with presented arms, and saluted by the officers, with melancholy music by a large and elegant Band.  
The military then preceeded the bier, in open column and inverted order, the left in front, with arms reversed, the band playing a dead march. At 12 o’clock the procession moved in the following order, through Beekman, Pearl, and whitehall-streets, and up Broadway to the Church:  
The Artillery.  
The 6th Regiment of Militia.  
Flank Companies.  
Cincinnati Society.  
A numerous train of Clergy of all denominations.  
  
  
The General’s horse appropriately dressed.  
His Children and Relatives.  
Physicians.  
Gouverneur Morris, the funeral orator, in his carriage.  
The Gentlemen of the Bar, all in deep mourning.  
The Lieutenant-Governor of the State, in his carriage.  
Corporation of the city of New-York.  
Resident Agents of Foreign Powers.  
Officers of our Army and Navy.  
Military and Naval Officers of Foreign Powers.  
Militia Officers of the State.  
The various officers of the respective Banks.  
Chamber of Commerce and Merchants.  
Wardens of the Port, and masters of vessels in the harbor.  
The President, Professors, and Students of Columbia College, in mourning gowns.  
St. Andrew’s Society, mostly in mourning.  
Tammany Society.  
Mechanic Society.  
Marine Society.  
Citizens in General.  
The Pall was supported by General Matthew Clarkson Oliver Wolcott, Esquire, Richard Harison, Esquire, Josiah Ogden Hoffman, Esquire, Richard Varick, Esquire, William Bayard, Esquire, and His Hon. Judge Lawrence.  
On the top of the coffin was the General’s hat and sword; his boots and spurs reversed across the horse. His grey horse, dressed in mourning, was led by two black servants dressed in white, and white turbans trimmed with black.  
The streets were lined with people; doors and windows were filled, principally with weeping females, and even the house tops were covered with spectators, who came from all parts to behold the melancholy procession.  
  
When the advanced platoon of the military reached the church, the whole column wheeled backward by sections from the flanks of platoons, forming a lane, bringing their muskets to a reversed order, and resting the cheek on the butt of the piece in the customary attitude of grief. Through the avenue thus formed, the corpse, preceded by the clergy of different denominations, the Society of Cincinnati, and followed by the relations of the deceased, and different public bodies, advanced to the church, the band, with drums muffled, playing all the time a pensive, solemn air.  
Funeral Oration.  
On the stage erected in the portico of Trinity Church, Mr. Gouverneur Morris, having four of General Hamilton’s sons, the eldest about sixteen and the youngest about six years of age, with him, rose and delivered to the immense concourse in front an extemporary Oration, which, being pronounced slowly and impressively, was easily committed to memory, and being very soon afterwards placed on paper, is presumed to be correct even to the language. Being shown to several gentlemen who heard it, they all agree that it comes near enough to what was actually delivered to be presented as that oration at length.  
Fellow Citizens,  
If on this sad, this solemn occasion, I should endeavour to move your commiseration, it would be doing injustice to that sensibility which has been so generally and so justly manifested. Far from attempting to excite your emotions, I must try to repress my own, and yet I fear that instead of the language of a public speaker, you will hear only the lamentations of a bewailing friend. But I will struggle with my bursting heart, to pourtray that Heroic Spirit, which has flown to the mansions of bliss.  
Students of Columbia—he was in the ardent pursuit of knowledge in your academic shades, when the first sound of the American war called him to the field. A young and unprotected volunteer, such was his zeal, and so brilliant his service, that we heard his name before we knew his person. It seemed as if God had called him suddenly into existence, that he might assist to save a world!  
The penetrating eye of Washington soon perceived the manly spirit which animated his youthful bosom. By that excellent judge of men he was selected as an Aid, and thus he became early acquainted with, and was a principle actor in the most important scenes of our Revolution.  
At the seige of York, he pertinaciously insisted—and he obtained the command of a Forlorn Hope. He stormed the redoubt; but let it be recorded, that not one single man of the enemy perished. His gallant troops emulating the heroism of their chief, checked the uplifted arm, and spared a foe no longer resisting. Here closed his military career.  
Shortly after the war, your favour—no, your discernment called him to public office. You sent him to the convention at Philadelphia: he there assisted in forming that constitution which is now the bond of our union, the shield of our defence and the source of our prosperity. In signing that compact he exprest his apprehension that it did not contain sufficient means of strength for its own preservation; and that in consequence we should share the fate of many other republics and pass through Anarchy to Despotism. We hoped better things. We confided in the good sense of the American people: and above all we trusted in the protecting Providence of the Almighty. On this important subject he never concealed his opinion. He disdained concealment. Knowing the purity of his heart, he bore it as it were in his hand, exposing to every passenger its inmost recesses. This generous indiscretion subjected him to censure from misrepresentation. His speculative opinions were treated as deliberate designs; and yet you all know how strenuous, how unremitting were his efforts to establish and to preserve the constitution. If, then, his opinion was wrong, pardon, oh! pardon that single error, in a life devoted to your service.  
At the time when our government was organised, we were without funds, though not without resources. To call them into action, and establish order in the finances, Washington sought for splendid talents, for extensive information, and, above all, he sought for sterling, incorruptible integrity—All these he found in Hamilton. The system then adopted has been the subject of much animadversion. If it be not without a fault, let it be remembered that nothing human is perfect. Recollect the circumstances of the moment—recollect the conflict of opinion—and above all, remember that the minister of a republic must bend to the will of the people. The administration which Washington formed, was one of the most efficient, one of the best that any country was ever blest with. And the result was a rapid advance in power and prosperity, of which there is no example in any other age or nation. The part which Hamilton bore is universally known.  
His unsuspecting confidence in professions which he believed to be sincere, led him to trust too much to the undeserving. This exposed him to misrepresentation. He felt himself obliged to resign. The care of a rising family, and the narrowness of his fortune, made it a duty to return to his profession for their support. But though he was compelled to abandon public life, never, no, never for a moment did he abandon the public service. He never lost sight of your interests. I declare to you, before that God in whose presence we are now so especially assembled, that in his most private and confidential conversations, the single objects of discussion and consideration were your freedom and happiness.  
You well remember the state of things which again called forth Washington from his retreat to lead your armies. You know that he asked for Hamilton to be his Second in command. That venerable sage well knew the dangerous incidents of a military profession, and he felt the hand of time pinching life at its source. It was probable that he would soon be removed from the scene, and that his Second would succeed to the command. He knew, by experience, the importance of that place—and he thought the sword of America might safely be confided to the hand which now lies cold in that coffin. Oh! my fellow citizens, remember this solemn testimonial, that he was not ambitious. Yet, he was charged with ambition: and wounded by the imputation, when he laid down his command, he declared in the proud independence of his soul, that he never would accept of any office, unless in a foreign war he should be called on to expose his life in defence of his country This determination was immoveable. It was his fault that his opinions and his resolutions could not be changed. Knowing his own firm purpose, he was indignant at the charge that he sought for place or power. He was ambitious only of glory, but he was deeply solicitous for you. For himself he feared nothing, but he feared that bad men might by false professions, acquire your confidence and abuse it to your ruin.  
Brethren of the Cincinnati—There lies our chief! Let him still be our model. Like him, after a long and faithful public service, let us cheerfully perform the social duties of private life. Oh! he was mild and gentle. In him there was no offence; no guile. His generous hand and heart were open to all.  
Gentlemen of the Bar—You have lost your brightest ornament. Cherish and imitate his example. While, like him, with justifiable, with laudable zeal, you pursue the interests of your clients, remember, like him, the eternal principles of justice.  
Fellow Citizens—You have long witnessed his professional conduct, and felt his unrivalled eloquence. You know how well he performed the duties of a Citizen—you know that he never courted your favour by adulation, or the sacrifice of his own judgment. You have seen him contending against you, and saving your dearest interests, as it were, in spite of yourselves. And you now feel and enjoy the benefits resulting from the firm energy of his conduct. Bear this testimony to the memory of my departed friend. I Charge You to Protect his Fame—It is all he has left—all that these poor orphan children will inherit from their father. But, my countrymen, that Fame may be a rich treasure to you also. Let it be the test by which to examine those who solicit your favour. Disregarding professions, view their conduct and on a doubtful occasion, ask, Would Hamilton have done this thing?  
You all know how he perished. On this last scene, I cannot, I must not dwell. It might excite emotions too strong for your better judgment. Suffer not your indignation to lead to any act which might again offend the insulted majesty of the law. On his part, as from his lips, though with my voice—for his voice you will hear no more—let me entreat you to respect yourself.  
And now, ye ministers of the everlasting God, perform your holy office and commit these ashes of our departed brother to the bosom of the Grave!  
The oration being finished the corpse was carried to the grave, where the usual funeral service was performed by the Reverend Bishop Moore. The troops who had entered the church yard, formed Photograph by William Prince you hastily read to me, contained things that rendered it desirable for me to recur to my own Notes. As I presume no publication will take place in the morning papers I will have the honor of seeing you again On my return to the City which will be about 9 o clock in the morning.

Morris OVER THE DEAD BODY  
or GENERAL HAMILTON.  
  
Fellow-Citizens,  
  
IF on this sad, this solemn oc-  
casion, I should endeavour to  
move your commiseration, it  
would be doing injustice to that  
sensibility which has been so gen-  
erally and so justly manifested.  
Far from attempting to excite  
your emotions, I must try to re-  
press my own, and yet I fear that  
instead of the language of a pub-  
lic speaker, you will hear only  
the lamentations of a wailing  
friend. But I willstruggle with  
my bursting heart, to portray the  
heroic spirit, which has flown to  
the mansions of bliss.  
  
tudents of Columbia! He was  
in the ardent pursuit of knowl-  
edge in your academic shades,  
when the first sound of the A-  
merican war called him to the  
field. A young and unprotected  
volunteer, such was his zeal and  
so brilliant his services, that we  
heard his name before we knew  
his person.—It seemed as if God  
had called him suddenly into ex-  
istence, that he might assist to  
tave a world !  
  
The penetrating eye of Wash-  
ington soon perceived the manly  
spirit which animated his youthful  
bosom. By that excellent judge  
of men he was selected as an aid,  
and thus he became early ac-  
quainted with, and was a princi-  
pal actor in the most important  
scenes of our revolution.  
  
At the siege of York, he perti-  
naciously insisted and he obtain-  
ed the commandof a forlorn hope.  
He stormed the redoubt ; but let  
it be recorded that not one single  
man of the enemy perished. His  
gallant troops, emulating the he-  
roism of their chief, checked the  
uplifted arm, and spared a foe  
no longer resisting. Here closed  
his military career.  
  
Shortly after the war, your  
favour—no, your discernment,  
called him to public office. You  
sent him to the convention at  
Philadelphia ; he there assisted in  
forming that constitution which  
is now the bond of our union, the  
shield of our defence, and the  
source of our prosperity. In sign-  
ing the compact he expressed his  
apprehension that it did not con-  
tain sufficient means of strength  
for its own preservation; and  
that in consequence we would  
share the fate of many other re-  
publics and pass through anarchy  
to despotism. We hoped better  
things. We confided in the good  
sense of the American: people ;  
and above all we trusted in the  
protecting Providence of the Al-  
mighty. On this important sub-  
ject he never concealed his opin-  
ion. He disdained concealment.  
Knowing the purity of his heart,  
he bore it as it were in his hand,  
exposing to every passenger its  
inmost recesses. ‘This generous

indiscretion subjected him to cen-  
surefrommisrepresentation. His  
speculative opinions were treated  
as deliberate designs ; and yet  
you all know how strenuous, how  
unremitting were his efforts to  
establish and to preserve the con-  
stitution. If then, his opinion  
was wrong, pardon, O! pardon  
that single error, in a life devoted  
to your service.  
  
At the time when our gov-  
ernment was organized, we were  
without funds, though not with-  
out resources. ‘To call them in-  
to action, and establish order in  
the finances, Washington sought  
for splendid talents, for extensive  
information, and above all, he  
sought for sterling, incorruptible  
integrity—All these he found in  
Hamilton. The system then adop-  
ted has been the subject of much  
animadversion. If it be not with-  
out a fault, let 1t be remembered  
that nothing human is perfect ;  
recollect the circumstances of the  
moment ; recollect the conflict  
of opinion, and above all, remem-  
ber that the minister of a republic  
must bend to the will of the people.  
The administration which /Vash-  
ington formed was one of the  
most efficient, one of the best that  
any country was ever blest with.  
And the result was a rapid ad-  
vance in power and prosperity,  
of which there is no example in  
any other age or nation. The  
part which Hamilion bore is uni-  
versally known.  
  
His unsuspecting confidence  
in professions which he believed  
to be sincere, led him to trust too  
much to the undeserving. This  
exposed him to misrepresentation.  
He felt himself obliged to resign.  
The care of a rising family, and  
  
the narrowness of his fortune;  
made it a duty to return to his  
profession for their support,  
But though he was compelled to  
abandon public life, never, no,  
never for a moment did he aban-  
don the public service. He nev-  
er lost sight of your interests. |  
declare to you, before that God  
in whose presence we are now  
so especially assembled, that in  
his most private and confiden-  
tial conversations, the single ob-  
jects of discussion and considera-  
tion were your freedom and hap-  
piness.  
  
You well remember the state  
of things which again called forth  
Washington from his retreat to  
lead your armies. You know  
that he asked for Hamilton to be  
his second in command. ‘That  
venerable sage well knew the  
dangerous incidents of @ military  
profession, and he felt the hand  
of time pinching life at its source.  
It was probable that he would  
soon be removed from the scene,  
and that his second would suc-  
ceedtothe command. Heknew,  
by experience, the importance of  
that place—and he thought the  
sword of America might safely  
be confided to the hand which  
now lies cold in that cofin. Oh!  
my fellow citizens, remember this  
solemn testimonial, that he was  
not ambitious. Yet he was  
charged with ambition; and,  
wounded by the imputation, when  
he laid down his command, he  
declared, in the proud indepen-  
dence of his soul, that lfe never  
would accept of any office, un-  
less in a foreign war he should  
be called on to expose his life in  
defence of his country. This  
determination was immoveable.

it was his fault that his opinions  
and his resolutions could not be  
changed. Knowing his own firm  
purpose, he was indignant at the  
charge that he sought for place  
or power. He was ambitious  
only for glory, but he was deeply  
solicitous for you. For himself  
he feared nothing, but he feared  
that bad men might, by false pro-  
fessions, acquire your confidence,  
and abuse it to your ruin.  
Brethren of the Cincinnati—  
There lies our chief! Let him  
still be our model. Like him,  
after long and faithful public ser-  
vices, let us cheerfully perform  
the social duties of private life.  
Oh! he was mild and gentle.  
In him there was no offence ; no  
guile. His generous hand and  
heart were open to all.  
Gentlemen of the Bar—You  
have lost your brightest orna-  
ment. Cherish and imitate his  
example. While, like him, with  
justifiable and with laudable zeal,  
you pursue the interests of your  
clients, remember, like him, the  
eternal principle of justice.  
Fellow Citizens—You have  
long witnessed his professional  
conduct, and felt his unrivalled  
eloguence. You know how well  
he performed the duties of a cit-  
izen—you know that he never  
courted your favour by adula-  
tion or the sacrifice of his own  
judgment. You have seen him  
contending against you, and sav-  
ing your dearest interests, as it  
Were, in spite of yourselves. And  
you now feel and enjoy the  
benefits resulting from the firm  
energy of his eondnct. Bear this  
testimony to the memory of my  
departed friend. J ch. arge you to  
protect his fame—it is all he has

left—all that these poor orphan  
children will inherit from their fa-  
ther. But, my countrymen, that  
fame may be a rich treasure to  
you also. Let it be the test by  
which to examine those who so-  
licit your favour. Disregarding  
professions, view their conduct,  
and on a doubtfu! occasion, ask,  
Would Hamilton have done this thing ?  
  
You all know how he perished.  
On this last scene, I cannot, L  
must not dwell. It might excite  
emotioris too strong for your bet-  
ter judgment. Suffer not your  
indignation to lead to any act  
which might again offend the in-  
sulted majesty of the laws. On  
his part, as from his lips, though  
with my voice ; for his voice you  
will hearno more ; let me entreat  
you to respect yourselves.  
  
And now, ye ministers of the  
everlasting Gop, perform your  
holy office, and commit these  
ashes of our departed brother to

sent him to the convention at Philadelphia; he §  
there assisted in forming that constitution, which ]  
is now the bond of our union, the shield of cur  
defence, and the source of our prosperity. Ii  
signing that compact he expressed his appre- r  
hensions that it did not contain sufficient means &amp; ab  
of strength for its own preservation; and that in a  
consequence we should share the fate of many &amp;  
other republics, and pass through Anarchy to @  
Despotism. We hoped better things. We con- &amp;  
Aided in the good sense of the American people;  
and, above all, we trusted in the protecting § |  
Providence of the Almighty. On this important |  
subject he never concealed his opinion. He  
disdained concealment. Knowing the purity of &amp;  
bis heart, he bore it as it were in his hand, ®&amp;  
exposing to every passenger its inmost recesses. 4 |  
This generous indiscretion subjected him to cen- F  
sure trom misrepresentation. His speculative &amp;  
opinions were treated as deliberate designs; and §  
yet you all know how strenuous, how unremit-  
iing were his efforts to establish and to preserve ff  
the constitution, Ii, then, his opinion was wrong §

FUNERAL ORATION.  
The following Oration, which we Cory  
from the Poft, was delivered by Go- j  
verneur Morris, Efq. over the corpfe  
of General Hamilton.  
Fellow Citizens !  
If on this fad, this folcmn occafion,  
Ifh uld end.-avour to move your com­  
mifferattbo, it would be doinj injuftice j  
to th-t fenfibility w&#x27;ich has been !  
fo generally and fo julily manifefted. |  
Far from attempting to excite ycur emo- j  
tions 1 muft try to reprefs my own, and j  
y*t I fear thit inftead of the language j  
nf a public fpeaker, you will hear Only i  
the lamentations of a bewailing friend. I  
But I will ftruggle with my burfting I  
hCirt, to that Heroic Spirit,  
which has flown to the xaanlions of  
blifs.  
Students of Gilumb&#x27;a-*-he was in the  
ardent pu-fnit of knowledge in your aca*  
deuiic fhadrg, when the firft found of i  
the American war called him to the j  
firld. A young and unprotected volun-1  
teer, fuch wan his aeal and fo brilliant  
his tervice that we heard his name be­  
fore we knew his prrfon.——lt f emed as  
if God hid called him fuddrnly intoex­  
iftence, that he might aifitl to fave a  
wo&gt; Id !  
The penetrating eye of &#x27;Wnfninglnrt  
fon pTCfived the fp&#x27;uit which  
animated his youthful bofom. By that  
excellent judge of men he was f Jetted  
as an Aid, and thus he became early  
acquitted with and was a principal ac&gt;  
tor in the moft important fcenct ot our  
Revolution.  
At the feige of York, he pertinacious­  
ly in lifted—and he obtained the com­  
mand of a Forlorn Hope. He ftormed  
the redoubt $ but let it he recorded that  
not one fingle man of the enemy perifli­  
ed. His gallant troops emulating the  
heroifm of their chief, checked the up­  
lifted arm, tr fpared a foe no lunger refill­  
ing. Hem clofed his military c -  
reer.  
Shortly after the war, your favdtir-***.  
no, your difr.ernment called him to puo­  
liccffice. You Cent him to the convent!  
tion at Philadelphia : he there affiltd  
in forming that confutation which is  
new th&quot;. b &gt;tid of our union, the fhieldof  
our defence &amp; the foUrceof our profperi*  
&#x27;y. In figning that compact he eKpYels&#x27;d |  
his apprehenfion that it did not contain  
fufficient means of ftrength for its own j  
pref.-rvatibn ; and that in confequnt* j  
We ft.- uld fhartf the fate of fnany ether &#x27;  
republics 8c pafi through anarchy to def- J  
potifm. We better thii-gs. We  
confided in the g-v.d (e&#x27;tifl of the Ame­  
rican people; kabove all we trufted in the  
pret.-cVing Providence of the Almighty.  
On this important fttbjeci be never con­  
cealed his opinion. He difdvined ton*  
ci alment. Knowing the purity of his  
heart, he bore it as it Were in his hand,  
to cv ry paffenger its tnmoft  
receffes. This gene&#x27;n.us indifcretion  
fuhjeVd him to cenfure from fnifrepre­  
fentation. His fpeculative opinions were  
treated as deliberate dtfigns ; and yet  
you all know how ftrenuous, how unre­  
mitting were his efforts to i ftablifh and  
to preicrve the conllitution. If, then his  
opinion was wrong, pardon, oh ! par­  
don that fmgle error, in a life devoted to  
your fervicc.  
At the time when our goternhien&#x27;t  
Was organifed, we were without funds,  
though not without refource.s. To call  
them into action, and eftablifti order in  
the finances, Wafhiugton fought for  
fp&#x27;endid talenti,forextenfive information  
and, above a&#x27;l, he fought for fterling  
incorruptible in*£grity.*---All thefe he  
found iv Hamilton—The fyfterri then  
adopted has been the fubj.*ft of much  
animadverfion. If it be not without a  
fault, let it be remembered that nothing  
human is perfe&lt;H—Recollect the cir­  
cumftanres of the moment—recollect  
the co; fl €t of opinior---*&gt;ind above all, \
rrmrmber flat the minister of a repub­  
lic must bend to the ttill of the people.-*  
The admmittta ion which Wafhington  
formed, was one of the moft efficient,&#x27;  
one ot the heft that any cruntry was (  
ever blelt with. And the refult Was a  
rapid advance in power and profperify, j  
ci * hith there is no example in any |  
other age or nation* The paf t which &#x27;  
Ha nil., n bore is univerfally known.  
H s unftifpec\ing confidence in pro-  
whicli he believed to be fmcere,  
ltd him to truft too much to the unde­  
serving. This him to mifr&#x27;*­  
prrfeitation- He ftlt himfelf obliged*  
to re fig n—The care of a lifing family,  
and the narrownefn of his fortune, made  
it a doty to return to his profeffion for  
their fupoort. But though he was com­  
pelled to abandon public life, never, no,  
never for a moment did he abandon the  
j-üblic tervice. He never loft fight of  
your int»reft—l declare to you, before  
that God in whi-fe pretence we are now  
fo efpecially affembled, that in his moft ,  
private and confidential conventions,  
the fingle objects of difcuflion and confi­  
deratioa were your freedom and hap.  
pinefs.  
You will remember the ftate ot things  
which again called forth Wafhington  
from his retreat to lead your armies, j  
You know that healked for Hamilton.  
  
ito be his fecond in command. That  
venerable lagfc well knew the danger  
ouj incidents of a military profefliou,  
• afcd he felt the hand of time &#x27;pinching  
; life at it* fource. It was probable that  
he would foon be removed from the fcene  
ard that his fecond would fucceed to  
the command. He knew, by experi­  
ence, the importance of that place—md  
he thought the fword of America might  
: fafely be confided to the hand v-bicb now  
I lies cold in that taffin. Oh !my frl­  
: low citizens, remember this folemn telli­  
! r.ionial that he was not ambitious. Yet  
ihe was charged with ambition ; and  
{ wounded by the imputation, when he  
j laid diwrt his command, he declared, in  
the proud independence of h&#x27;u foul, tint  
I he never would accept of any office, tin­  
&#x27; lefs in a foreign war he fhould be cal­  
led on to expof: his life in defence of his  
country. This determination was im­  
moveable. It was his fault that his  
opinions and his refolutions could not be  
changed. Knowing his own fi m pur­  
pofe, he was indighant at the charge that  
Ihe fought frr place or power. He was  
I ambiri»us only of glory, but he was deep­  
ly felicitous for you. For himfelf he  
feared nothing, but h« feared that bad  
men might, by falfe profeffions, acquire  
your confidence and abufe it to your  
rnim  
Brethren of the Cincinnati—There  
lies our chief I Let him ttill be our mo­  
del. Like him, after long and faithful  
public fervice, let us c.hetrfnlly perform  
the focial duties of private life. Oh I he  
was mild and gentle. In him there was  
no o3*nce ; no guile. His generons  
hand and heart were open to all.

Tacrifice of his own judgment. You  
I have fern him contending againft jroO,

On Saturday laft the remains of Alexander j  
Hamilton were committed to the grave with j  
every poflible tcftimony of rcl&#x27;pedt and forrow&#x27;. •  
That diltant readers may form fume idea of ;  
what palled on this mournful occaGon, we flu,11 1  
here prefeni them with a regular and correct ac- 1  
count of the whole fcene.  
“ The Military, under the command of Lieu­  
tenant Col. Moreton, were drawn up in front  
of Mr. Church&#x27;s houfe, in R.ibinfon-flrect,  
Where the body had been depofitcd. On the  
appearance of the corpfe it was received by the  
whole line with prefented arms, and fainted by j  
the officers, with melancholy malic by a large [  
and elegant Band.  
The military then preceded the bier, in open  
column and inverted order, the left in front, |  
with arms reverfed, the hand playing a dead i  
march. At 12 o’clock the proceffion moved in j  
the following order, through Beckman, Pearl, &amp;  
Whilchall-llieets, and up Broadway to the  
Church :  
The Artillery.  
The 6th Regiment of Militia.  
Flank Companies.  
Cincinnati Society.  
A numerous train of Clergy of ail denominati­  
ons.  
THE CORPSE,  
With Pall Bearers.  
The General’s Horfe, appropriately dreffed.  
His Children and Relatives.  
P’nylieians.  
Gouvcrneur Morris, the fur.tral orator, in his ;  
carriage.  
The Gentlemen of the Bar, all in deep mourn­  
ing.  
The Lieutenant-Governor of the (late in his car- ;  
riage.  
Corporation of the City of New-York.  
Refldent Agents of Foreign Powers.  
Officers of our Army and Navy.  
Military and Naval Officers of Foreign Powers.  
Militia Officers of the State.  
The various officers of the refpeftive Banks.  
Chamber of Commerce and Merchants.  
Wardens of the Tort, and Matters of veflels in  
the harbor.  
The Prefident, I’rofelFors, and Students of Co­  
lumbia College, in mourning gowns.  
Si. Andrew’s Society, moltty In mourning.

me top or tne cotiin was the General’s  
hat and fword, with boots and fptirs reverfed  
acrofs the horfe. His grey horfe drefled in  
mourning, was led by two hiack fervants drefled  
in white, and white turbans trimmed with  
black.”  
The flrtets were lined with people ; doors &amp;  
windows were filled, principally with weeping  
females, andeven the houfe tops were covered  
with fpedtators who came from all parts to be­  
hold the melancholy procelTion.  
“ V. lien the advanced platoon of the militarv  
reached the church, the whole column wheeled  
backward by fcdions from the flanks of pla­  
toons, forming a lane, bringing their rnufleets to  
a reverfed order, and reding the cheek on the  
butt of the piece in the cuftomary attitude of  
grief. &#x27;Through the avenue thus formed, the  
corpfe, preceded by the clergy of different de­  
nominations and Society of Cincinnati, and fol­  
lowed by the relations of the dteeafed, and dif­  
ferent public botiir&gt;, advanced to the church,  
the band, with dt urns muffled, all the time  
playing a pen five, folemn air.”  
HJNERAI, ORATIOtf.  
°n a Sage eredled in the portico of Trinity Church,  
Mr. Oouvcmeur Morris, having four of General I la­  
milton’s fons, tlie eldefc about fixteco and the youngeft  
about fix years of age, with him, rofi&gt; anil delivered* to  
the ir.imenfc conccwrfe in front nil extemporary or.tti­  
or., wlil-.i;, being pronounced liowly anti impreffivcly  
was eafily committed to memory, and being very foon  
afterwards placed on paper is now preftimetl to be cor­  
rect even to the language. Being Ihown to fcvcral  
gentlemen who heard it, they all agree that it comes  
near enough to what was ad nelly delivered to be pre­  
fented as the oration at length.  
FeLLOW-ClTiZENS,  
If on this fad, this folemn occaGon, ! fhotild endea­  
vour to move your commiferation, it would be doing  
injuftice to that fenfibility which has been fo general&quot;  
ly and fo juftly nianifefted. Far from attempting to  
excite your emotions I mud try to reprefs my own! Ac  
yet I fear that inftead of the language of a public fpe ik­  
er, you will hear only the lamentations of a heWnilhv­  
frieud. But I will ft niggle with my burfting heart&#x27;,  
to pourtray that Heroic Spirit, which has flown to the  
nunfionsof blifs.  
.Students of Columbia—he was in the ardent pur­  
f&#x27;dt of knowledge in your academic fbades, when thfc  
ftrlt found of tlie American w ar railed him to the field.  
A young and unprotected volunteer, fuch w;urhis ze d  
and fo brilliant lus fi-rvice that we heard his name be­  
fore v knew his perion.—It feemed as if GoD had  
called him fuddcnly into exiftence, that lie might aflift  
to lave a world !  
I he penetrating eye of Walhington foon perceived  
the marly fpirit-x iiich animated his youthful bnfi.m.  
dy that excellent judge of men h- was fekifted as an  
Aid,and thus he became early acquainted with and  
v as a prmcip&#x27;il a-ftor in the moll important fi-cius of  
our Revolution.  
At the fiege of York. be pertinacioufly infilled—and  
be obtained the command of a Forlorn Hope. He  
ttnrni-^ the redoubt; but let it be recorded that Dot  
one fingir mail of the enemy perifhed. His gallant  
troops emulating the heroifm of their chief, checked the  
uplif- d arm, and Ipafed a foe no longer refilling.  
Here c’ofed nil mihtary career.  
Shortly alter the war, your favour——no, your  
difeemmem called him to public office. You fent him  
to the convention at Philadelphia : he there aflifted in  
fanning that conlliiution which is now the boud ol our  
  
I union, the fbieh! of our defence .and the fource of our  
; rofpvrity. In fig&#x27;iing that cumpadt he e.rprell his :tp­  
prehenlion that it did not contain fulFtcieut means of  
ftrcugth for its own prefervation ; and tint in confe­  
quefice we ihould (hare the fate pf many other repuh­  
Iich and pafs through Anarchy to Defpotifm. We  
hoped better things. We confided in the good fenfe  
Oi the American people j aud above all we trufted in  
the protefiing Providence of the Almighty. On this  
important IttbjeiH he never concealed his opinion. He  
dildaineil concealment. K.:o\s ing the purity of his  
heart, he bore it as it were in his hand, txpoling to e­  
very paflenger its inmeft recedes. This generous in­  
diferetion fubjeifted him to cenfure from mifrenrefen­  
tatiou. Ifislpeculative opinions were treated as deli­  
i&gt;er ite de!;g;is; and vet you all know how (rrenuous,  
how unremitting were his efforts to eftahlifh and to  
prelerve the cotiilitution. If, then, his opinion was  
wrong, pardon, oh 1 pardon that fingle error, in a life  
devoted to your lervice.  
At the time when our government was organized,  
we were without funds, though no: without rcfources.  
To c-ill them into adio.i, and eftublilh order in the fi­  
nances, Wufhi.igton fought for lplendid talents, f r ex­  
tenlive information, and,above all, he fought for fief- I  
ling, incorruptible integrity—All thefe be found in  
  
i. minium— i ixe xyuenunen adopted lias been the lub­  
jed of much r.nimadverfion. If it be not without a  
fault, let it !&gt;&lt;■ remembered that nothing human is p »r­  
fadt—Recoiled! the circumftunces of the moment—tv­  
coiiedl the confiitftof opinion—and above all,remem­  
ber that tile tninifter of a republic nuift bend to the  
wiil c f the people.—The adirhniftration which Waih­  
ington formed, was or.e of the tnoft elficient, one of the  
heft that any country was ever bicft with. Arid the  
reiul: was a rapid advance in power and prosperity, of  
which there is no example in any other age or nation. ,  
l lie part which Hamilton bore is Unircrfally known.  
His unfufpcdiing confidence in pi eflions which be  
behoved to be lincere, ltd hint to trui too much to the  
undeferving. This etpofed him to mili cprefentation.  
He felt hitnfclf obliged to relign.—The care of a rifing  
family, and the narrowr.efs of his fortune, made it a  
duty to return to his prnfeffion far their fupport. Hut  
though he was compelled to abandon public life, never,  
no, never for a moment did he abandon the public fer­  
vice. He never loft light of your inrerefts--1 de­  
clare to you, before that God in whole prefence we  
arc now fo fpeci illy ufteinhied, that in bis 1110ft private  
a:. J confidential converfutions, the ftngle objedls of dil­  
cufTion and confideration were your ftecJoni and liap­  
pinefs. r  
You will remember the Hate of things which again  
called forth Wathington from his retreat to lead your  
armies. ! ou know that he afked fur Hamilton to be  
his Second in command. That venerable lage well  
knew the dangerous incidents of ;i military profeffion,  
and he felt the hand of time pinching life at itsfatirce.  
It was prooable tnat be would foon be removed from  
the lcene and that hi; Second would fucceod to the  
command, lie knew, by experience, the importance  
of that place—and he thought the fword of America  
might fafely be confided to the hand which now lies  
cold in that coffin. Oh ! my fellow-citizens, remem­  
ber this folemn teftinionia! that he was i.ot ambitious.  
Y et he was charged with ambition; and wounded bj the  
iv.iptxtation, when he laid down his command he de­  
clared, in the proud independence of his foul, that he  
never would accept of any office, uixlefs in a foreign  
war he fkould be called on to oxflnfa his life in defence  
of his country. This determination was immoveable.  
It was his fault that bis opinions and his relolutior.s  
could not be changed. Knowing his own firm pur­  
pofe, be was indignant at the charge that lie fought  
far place or power. He was ambitious or.ly of glory,  
but he was deeply fobcitous for you. For himfelf he  
feared nothing, but he feared that bad nten might, by  
falfe prol&#x27;efiions, acquire your confidence and abufs  
it to your ruin.  
Brethren ol the Cincinnati—There lies our chief!  
I.&lt; t him Axil be nur model. Tike him, after long and  
faithful public farvice. let us cheerfully perform the  
facial duties of private life. Oh ! he was mild and  
gentle, in him there was no offence ; no guile. His  
generous hand and heart were open to all.  
Gentlemen of the Bar—You have faft yourbright­  
eft ornament. Clierilh and imitate his example.  
White, like him, with juft!Cable, with laudable zeal,  
you purfue the inte.-efts of your clients, remember, hke  
him, the eternal principles of juft ice.  
Fellow-citizens-You have long witoeffed his  
nroieiiiolliil comiu^). anrl Me  
  
You knowhow well he performed the du iesofa citi­  
zen—you know that he never courted your favour by  
adulation or the lacnhce of his own judgment. You  
have feen him contending again ft you, and faying  
your deavefl intcreftt, as it were in fpite of yourfelve*.  
And you now feel and enjoy the benefits refnlting from  
the firm energy of his conduct. Bear this teflimcny to  
die memory of my departed friend. 1 charge you  
ro protect his fame-!t is all he has left­  
all thefe poor orphan children will inherit from their  
father. But my country, that Fame may be a rich  
treaf&#x27;ure to you alfo. I.et it be the tell hy which to ex­  
amine thofe who folicit yout luvou*-. Dil’regarJin&#x27;­  
profelfions, view their conduct, and on a doubtful oc­  
cafioii, aik, iycvlci Humttlvn have d&#x27;mt this tlcni* ?  
Y ju all know how he perifhed. On thi, laft feene,  
1 cannot, l inuft not dwell. It might excite emotions  
too ftrong for your better judgment. Suffer net your  
indignation to lead to any act which might again of­  
fend the infulted majefty of the laws. Oil his part, an  
from his lips, though with my voice—for his voice  
you wdl hear no more—let me entreat you to refpect  
yourfelves.  
And now ye minifters of the everlafting Goo, per­  
forin your holy office and commit thefe afhes of our  
departed brother to the bofom of the Grave !  
The oration being finifned the corpfe was carried to  
the grave where the ufual Amend lcrvice was perform­  
ed by the Reverend ftifhop Moore. The troops who  
had entered the church yard, formed an extenfive hol­  
low Iqaare end terminated the lolemnities with three  
vollies over the grave.

- Frirow Crrizens,  
.IF on this fad, this folemn oceafion, T fhoald  
endeavor to move your comiifferation, it  
would be doing injußice to that feufibility which  
has been fo gcqofhy and o joftly mnikﬂcdi  
Far from attempting to excite yuar en otions  
muft try to reprels my owa, and yet I fear that  
infiead of the language of &amp; publie fpeaker, you  
will bear only the lamentations of a bewailing  
friccd. But I will Rroggle with my berttiog  
heart, to pourtray that Hetoie Spirit, which has  
flown to the manfions of blifs.  
Students of Columbia—he was in the ar«  
dent parfoit of knowledge in ycur academic  
{hades, when the fift fcund ot the American  
war called him to the field, A young and un­  
protefied volunteer, fuch was his zcal and fo  
britliant his fervice that we heard of his pame be­  
fore we knew his peifon,—lt feemed as of God  
had called him fuddenly into exiftence, that he  
might afift 1o fave a wurld !  
The pevetrating eye of Wathington foon  
perceived the manly fpirit which animated bis  
youthtul bofom, By that excellent judge of  
men he was feledied as an Aid, and thuos he be­  
came early acquainted with and was a principal  
attor i ihe moft important feenes of our Reve  
viution, .  
  
At the fiege of Yoik, be pertinacioufly ine  
fified and obrained the command of a Ferlon  
Hope. He flormed the redoubt ;. but et it be  
recorded that vot ove fingle man of the coemy

You fent him to the convention at Philadele  
phia; he there aftfted in forming that conflitue  
tion which is row the bond of cur union, the  
fhield of cur defence and the fource of our profe  
perity, In figning that ¢ mpaét he expreft hia  
apprebenfion that it did nos contain fufficient  
means of firength for its own prefervation ; and,  
that in confequence we fhould fhare the fate of  
many other republics,and pafs through Anarchy  
to Defpoulm, We hoped better things. We  
confided in the good fenfe of the American peo«  
ple; and above ail we trufted i tiie proweéling  
Providence of the Almighiy. On this import­  
ant fubjet he oever concealed his opinion. He  
difdained concealment, Knowing the purity of  
his heare, he bore it as it were on his hand ,expof­  
ing to eveiy paflenger its inmoft receffes. This  
gencrous indifcietion fubjeéted him 1o cenfore  
trom mifreprefentation. His fpeculative opin­  
ions were treated as deliberate defigns : And yet  
you all know how ftrenucus, how unremitang  
were bis effurts 1o efablith and to preferve the  
conftitation, If, then, his opinion was wrang,  
pardon, O ! pardon that fingle error, in a hite  
devoted 10 your ferviee, }  
At ihe time when our government was ore  
gavized, we were wiihoat tands, though not  
withot refources. To call them into alion,  
and eftabiith order in the finances, Wathingron  
fought tor fplendid talen s, for extenfive intorme  
ation, and above all, he fooght for Rerling, in&lt;  
corrapiible integrity.—All thefe he found in  
Hamilton.—~The fyftem he then adopted, has  
been the fobjeét of much animadverfion, If it  
be not without a fault, let it be remembered that  
nothing haman is jerfe@ : Recolle@® the cir­  
cemfaces of the moment 3 recolle@ the couflict  
of opinion; and above all, remember that zbe  
minifler of a sepublic mufl bend to the will of the  
pesple.— Lhe admiviftrarion which Wafhington  
formed was ove of the moft efficient, one of the  
bett that any country was ever bleft with, And  
the refult was a rapid advance in power and .  
profperity, of which there is no-example in any  
other age or nation. The part which Hamil­  
ton bore is univerfally known,  
  
His unfefpedling confidence in profeffions  
which he believed to be fincere, led lam to troft  
teo much to the undeferving, This expofed him  
to mifreprefentation, He Fclt himfclf obliged to |  
refign. The carc of a nifing family, and the nare  
rowaefs of his fortune, made it a doty to return  
to his profeflion for their fapport, Bat though  
he was compeliled 10 abandon public life, never,  
no never for a moment did he abandon the pube  
licfervice. He never lof fight of &#x27;vour interefle  
I declare (o you before ghat God in whofe  
prefence we are nhw fo cgecia}ly affembled,  
that in his moft private and confidential converfa­  
tions, the fingle objeéls of difcuffion and confider~  
ation were your fieedom and happinels.  
You well remember the faie of things  
which again called forth Wathington from his  
retreat to lead your anmies. You know that he  
afked for Hamilton to be the fecond in command,  
‘I hat venerable fage well knew the dangerous  
incidents of a military profeffion, and bcgll the  
hand of time pinchin*dﬁk at its foarce. It was  
probable that he would foon be removed from  
the fcene, &amp; that his fecond would fucceed to the  
command. He koew, by experience, the im­  
portance of that place—2od he tbo-xln the  
fword of America might fafely be coofided 10  
the hand that now lies cold in that coffin. Oh!  
my fellow.citizens, remember this folemn tefti­  
monial, that he was not ambitious, Yet he was  
charged with ambition; and wounded by the  
impotaton. When he laid down his command, he  
declared, in the proud independcnce of his foel,  
that he never would accept of any cffice, unicfs  
in a foreign war he thould be called on to ex­  
s:fo his lir in defence of his country, This  
termioation was immovable. It wes his  
fault that his opinions and his refolations couid

GEN. HAMILTON’S FUNERAL ORATION.  
On a stage erected in the portico of Tri­  
nity church, Mr. Gouveraeur Morris, hav­  
ing four of Gen. Hamilton’s sons, the old­  
est about sixteen, and the youngest about  
six years of age, with him, rose and deli­  
vered to the concourse in front, an extem­  
pore oration, which being pronounced slow­  
ly and impressively, was easily committed  
to memory, and being very soon afterwards  
placed on paper, is now presumed, to. be  
correct, even to the language. Being  
shewn to several gendemen, who heard it,  
they all agree that it comes near enough to  
what was actually delivered to be present­  
ed as the oration at length.  
  
, reuotv utuzens /  
IF on this sad, this solemn occasion, I  
should endeavour, to move your commise­  
ration, it would be doing injustice to that  
sensibility which has been so generally and  
so justly manifested. Far from attempting  
to excite your emotions, I must try to re­  
press my own, and yet I fear that instead,  
of the language of a publick speaker, you  
will hear only the lamentations of a bewail­  
ing friend. But I will struggle with my  
bursting heart, to pourtray that heroick spi­  
rit,which has flown to the mansions cf bliss.  
Students of Columbia—he was in the ar­  
dent pursuit of knowledge in your acade­  
mick shades, when the first sound of the  
American war called him to the field.- A  
young and unprotected volunteer, such was  
his zeal, and. so brilliant hit. service, that,  
we heard his name before we knew Ids per­  
son. It seemed as if Cod had called him  
suddenly into existence, that he might as­  
sist to saveavworhftu »*»  
The penetrating eye of Washington soon  
perceived the manly spirit which animated  
his youthful bosom. $)y that excellent judge  
of men he was selected as an aid; and thus  
he became early acquainted with, and Nvas  
a principal actor in, the most important*  
scenes of our revolution. ’  
At the siege of York he. pertinaciously  
insisted upon, and he obtained, the command  
of a Forlorn Hope. He stormed the redoubt;  
but let it be recorded that not one single  
man of the .enemy perished. His gallant&#x27;  
troops, emulating the heroism of their  
chiefs checked the uplifted arm, and spar­  
ed a foe no longer resisting. Here closed  
his military career. \ ‘ i  
Shortly after the war, youf* favour, ho,  
you rdiscernmeht, called hjm to public!: of­  
fice. You sent him to the convention af  
Philadelphia ; he there assisted in forming  
that constitution which is now the bond of  
our union, the shield &gt; of our defence, and  
the source &#x27;of our prosperity. In signing  
that compact he&#x27;expressed his apprehension  
that it did not contain sufficient means of  
  
itichgth for its hWhbfwi  
servation i. and that  
m consequence we should shr^c the fate of  
rnany other republicksf and pass through  
things. We confided in the good Sense of  
the American i people, i and above all we  
trusted in the protecting Providence of the  
Almighty. On this important subject he  
never concealed his opinion. He disdain­  
ed concealment. Knowing the purity of  
his heart, he bore it, as it wefe, in his  
hand, exposing to every passenger its in­  
most recesses. This generous indiscretion  
subjected him to censure from misrepre­  
sentation. His speculative opinions were  
treated as deliberate designs. And yet you  
all know how strenuous, how unremitting  
were his efforts to establish and to preserve j  
the constitution. If, then, his opinion  
was wrong, pardon, oh 1 pardon that sin­  
gle errour, in a life devoted to yourservice.  
better  
  
At the time when our government was  
organized, we were without funds, though  
not without resources. To call them into  
action, and establish order in the finances,  
Washington sought for splendid talents,  
for extensive information, and above all,  
he sought for sterling, incorruptible inte­  
grity—All these he,found in Hamilton.—  
The system then adopted has been the sub­  
ject of much animadversion. If it be not  
without a fault, let it be remembered that  
nothing human is perfect—Recollect the  
circumstances of the moment—recollect  
the conflict of opinion—and above all, re­  
member that the minister of arepuhlick must  
bend to the will of the people. The admi­  
nistration which Washington formed, was  
one of the most efficient, one of the best,  
that any country was ever hlest with. And  
the result was rapid advance in power and  
prosperity, of which there is no example  
in any other age or nation. The part which  
Hamilton bore is universally known.  
His unsuspecting confidence in professi­  
- oris which he believed to be sincere, led  
him- to trust too much to the undeserving.  
This exposed him to misrepresentation.—  
He felt himself obliged to resign—The  
care of a rising family, and the narrowness  
of his fortune, made it a duty to return to  
his profession for their support. But  
though he was compelled to abandon pub­  
lick life, never, no, never for a moment  
did he abandon the publick service. He  
never lost sight of your interests—I declare  
to you, before that God in whose presence  
we are now especially assembled, tha; in  
his most private and confidential conversa­  
tions, the single objects of discussion and  
consideration were your freedom and hap­  
piness.  
Yota well remember the state of things  
which again called forth Washington from j  
his retreat tp lead your armies. You know  
that he asked for Hamilton to be his second  
in command. That venerable sage well  
knew the dangerous incidents bf tne mili­  
tary profession, and he felt the hand of  
time pinching life at its source. It was pro­  
bable that he would soon be removed from  
the scene, and that his second would suc­  
ceed to the command. He knew by expe­  
rience, the importance of that place :  
and he thought the sword of America  
might safely be confided to the hand which  
now lies cold in that coffin. Oh! my fel­  
low citizens, remember this solemn testi­  
monial that he was not ambitious. Yet he  
was charged with ambition ; and, wounded  
by the imputation, when he laid down his  
command, he declared, in the proud in­  
dependence of his soul, that he would ne*  
ver accept of any office, unless, in a foreign  
war, he should be called on to expose his  
life in defence of his country. This de­  
termination was immovable. It was his;  
fault that his opinions and his resolutions  
could not be changed. Knowing his own  
firm purpose, he was indignant at the  
charge that he sought for place or power.  
He was ambitious only of glory, but he  
was deeply solicitous for you. For him- j  
self he .feared nothing, but he feared that  
bad men might, by false professions, ac­  
quire your confidence, and abuse it to your  
ruinr .. . --...  
  
Brethren ot the Cincinnati— 1 here lies  
our. chief. Let him still be our model. Like  
him, after* long and faithfulpublick service,  
let us cheerfully perform the social duties  
of private life. Oh ! he was mild and gen­  
tle. In him there was no offence; no guile.  
His generous hand and heart were open  
to all. ‘  
Gentlemen of the Bar-—You have lost  
vpur brightest ornament. Cherish and  
imitate his example. -While, like him,  
with justifiable, with laudable, zeal, you­  
pursue the interests of your chants, remem­  
ber like him, the eternal principles of jus­  
tice. ,, , • .  
Fellow citizens—You have long witnes­  
sed his&#x27;professional conduct, and felt his  
unrivaled eloquence. You know how well  
he performed the duties of a citizen—You  
know that he never courted your favour by  
adulation, or the sacrifice of his own judg­  
ment. , You have seen him contending  
against your and saving your dearest in­  
terests, as it were, in spite of yourselves.  
And you now feel and enjoy the benefits  
resulting from the firm energy of his con-,  
duct. Bear this testimony to the memo­  
- - * . - .. v.  
  
ry of ray departedfrtend. -I cha-rof. tow •  
TO protect HIS r Am—It is all he has left  
~-all that those poor orphan children Trill  
inherit from their father.- But, my coun­  
trymen, that ferae may be a rich treasure  
to you also. Let it be the test by which  
to examine those who solicit your favour. «  
Disregarding their professions* View their  
conduct, and on a doubtful occasion ask, ,  
IVot/ld Hamilton have done thi&amp; thing?  
You all know how he perished. Y)n this ,  
last scene, I cannot, I must not dwell.  
It might excite emotions too strong for  
your better judgment; - Suffer not your in* „  
dignation to lead to any act which might a­  
gain offend the insulted majesty of the  
laws. On his part, as from his lips, tho*  
with my voice—-for his voice you will hear  
no more—-let me entreat you to respect  
yourselves.  
And now ye ministers of the everlasting  
God, perform your holy office,. and com­  
mit these ashes of our departed brother to  
the bosom of the grave 1 .

playing a pensive, solemn air.

has beansogmerslly snd so justly  
nifei&#x27;ted. Far from attempting to ex*  
cite your emotion 1 must try to repress  
my own, and yet I fear, that instead cf  
the language of a public speaker, you  
will hear only the lamentations of a be*  
I wailing friend. But 1 will struggle with  
my bursting heart, to portray that heroic  
[ spirit, which has flown to the mansions  
of bliss.  
Students of Columbia—he was in the  
J ardent pursuit of knowledge in your aca*  
| demie shades, when the first sound of  
; the American war called him to the field.  
A young and unprotected volunteer, such  
! was his zeal and so brilliant his service  
I&#x27;hat we heard his name before we knew  
I his person—It seemed as if God had  
I piled him suddenly into existence, that  
[ he might assist to save a world ;  
The penetrating eye of Washington  
I soon perceived the manly spirit which  
] animated his youthful bosom. By that  
I excellent judge of men he was selected  
Ml aid, and thus he became early ac­  
l qnainted with and was a principal actor  
in the most important scenes of our Re­  
volution.  
At the siege of York, he pertinacious­  
I ly insisted—and he obtained the com­  
mand of a Forlome Hope. He stormed  
the redoubt; but let it be recorded that  
not one single man of the etu-mv perish­  
ed. His galaht troops emulating the he­  
t roism of their chief, checked the uplifted  
arm, and spared a foe no longer resisting.  
Here closed his military career.  
  
L  
Shortly after the war, your iavouf—  
I no, your discernment, called him to  
public office. You sent him to the con­  
f vent ion at Philadelphia ; he there as­  
sisted in forming that Constitution which  
is now the bond of our union, the shield  
of our defence and the source of our pros­  
perity. In signing that compact be ejfc­  
prest his apprehension that it did not con­  
tain sufficient means of strength for its  
f own preservation; and that in conse  
| ijuence we should share the fate of mi­  
| nv other republics and pass through A  
! narchy to Despotism. We hoped better  
i things. We confided in the good sense  
| of the American people ; and above all  
we trusted iu the protecting providence  
i of the Almighty. On this important  
subject he never concealed his opinion-.  
He disdained concealment. Knowing  
| the purity of his heart, he bore it as it  
were in his hand, exposing to every pas­  
senger its inmost recesses, Tnis.gene­  
rout indiscretion subjected him to ecu­  
[sure from misrepresentation.. His spe­  
culative opinions were treated, as delibe­  
rate designs ; and yet you all know how  
strenuous, how unremitting were his  
| efforts to establish and to preserve the  
constitution. If, then, his opinion was  
wrong, pardon, oh | pardon that single  
I error, in alife devoted to ypur service.  
At the time when our government was  
I organized, we were without funds, tho’  
not without resources. . To call them  
[into action, and establish order in the  
faanccs, Washington sought for splcn­  
| did talents, for extensive information.  
ad, above all, he sought for sterling,  
j incorruptible integrity—AH these he  
| found An Hamilton. The system then  
I adopted has been the subject of much  
| animadversion. If it be not Without a  
lit, let it be remembered, that nothing  
I human is perfect—Recollect the circum­  
I stances of the moment—Recollect the  
| conflict of opinion—and above all, re­  
I member that the minister of a Republic  
must bend to the vcill ofthe people— --The  
I administration which Washington form  
*-d, was one of the most efficient, one of  
the best that any country was ever blest  
with. And the result was a rapid ad­  
vance in power and prosperity, of which  
there is no example in any other age or  
nation. The part which Hamilton bore  
is universally known. ■■ &lt;  
  
Hi* unsuspecting commence in pro*  
I fessions which he bcl&#x27;evcd to be sincere,  
I led him to trust too touch to the unde*  
■ serving. This exposed him to mitre*  
1 presentation. He felt himself obliged to  
I resign. The Care of a rising family, and  
he narrowness of&#x27;his fortune, made it a  
uty to return to his profession for their  
I support. But though he was compelled  
I to abandon public life, never, no, never  
for a moment did he abandon the public  
service. He never lost sight of your in­  
I tc rests. I declare to you, before that  
[ God in whose presence we are now espe.  
I daily assembled, that in his most private  
| and confidential conversations, the sin­  
isle objects of his discussion and consi­  
I deration were your freedom and happi­  
[ness.  
You well remember the state of things  
I that again called forth Washington from  
his retreat to head our armies. You  
I know that he asked for Hamilton to be  
I his Second io command. That venera*  
1 Me sage well knew the dangerous inc’i­  
Ttienu of a military profession, and he  
  
felt the hand of time pinching life at j|  
sourer. It was probable that he wotflfi  
soon be removed Arons the scene and that  
his Second would succeed to the com*  
mand. He knew, by experience, the  
importance of that place—and he thought  
the fword of America might safely be  
confided to that hand which now lies cold  
in that coffin. Oh my fellow citizens,  
remember this solemn testimonial that  
he was not ambitious. Yet he was char­  
ged with ambition j and wounded by the  
impution, when he laid down his com­  
mand, he declared, in the proud inde­  
pendence of his soul, that he never would  
accept of any office, unless in a foreign  
war he should be called on to expose his  
life in defence of his country. This de­  
termination was immoveable,. It was his  
fault that his opinions and his resoluti­  
ons would nut be changed. Knowing  
his own Arm purpose, he was indignant  
at the charge that he sought for place or  
power. He was fatnbitious of glory, but  
he was deeply solicitous Tor you. 1 or  
himself he feared nothing, but he feared  
that bad men might, by false professions,  
acquire your confidence and abuse it to  
your ruin.  
Brethren of the Cincinnati—There  
lies your Chief! Let him still be your  
model. Like him, after long and faith­  
ful public services. Ictus cheerfully per­  
form the social duties of pnvate life.—*  
Oh 1 he was mild and gentle. In him  
there was no offence i no guile. His  
generous hand and heart were open to  
all. ■ . . •••  
  
Gentlemen of the Bar—You have lost  
your Brightest ornament. Cherish and  
imitate his example. While, like him,  
with justifiable, with laudable zeal, you  
purine the Interests of your clients, re­  
member, like him, the eternal princi­  
ples of justice.  
Fellow Citizens—You have long wit­  
nessed his professional conduct, and felt 1  
his unrivalled eloquence. You know!  
how well-he performed the duties of a?  
citizen—You know that he never court-&#x27;  
ed your favor by adulation or the sacri- ■  
lice of his own judgment. Yon have seen .  
him contending against you, and saving -  
your&#x27;dearest interests, as it were, in :  
spite of yourselves. And you now feel 1  
and enjoy the benefits resulting from the  
firm energy of his conduct, Bear this,  
testimonv to the memorv of mv depart- :  
ed Friend. I CHARGE YOU TO  
PROTECT HIS FAME-It is all  
he has left—all that these poor orphan  
children will inherit from their father.— ;  
But my countrymen, that FAME may*  
be a rich treasure to you also. Let it be j  
the test by which to examine those who  
solicit vour favour. Disregarding pro­  
fessions, view their conduct, snd on s  
doubtful occasion, ask, Would Hamilton  
have done thU thing f  
You all know how he perished. . On  
this last scene, 1 canrtot, I must not  
dwell. It might excite emotions too  
strong for vnur better judgment. Suffer  
not your indignation to lead to any&#x27; act  
which might again offend the insulted  
majesty of the laws. On his part, as  
from his lips, though with my voice—for  
his voice youwiQ hear no more—-let me  
entreat you to respect yourselves.  
And now, ye Ministers of the Ever­  
tasting GOD, perform your Holy office,  
and commit these ashes of our departed  
Brother to the boaom of the Grave 1  
  
The Oration being finished, the corpse  
was carried to the grave, where the usu­  
al funeral service Was performed by the  
|rev. Bishop Moore. The troops who  
had entered the Church yard, formed an  
extensive hollow square and terminated  
the solemnities With three volies Over  
the grave.  
During the procession there was a re.  
Siar discharge of minute guns from the  
ttery, by a detachment from the regi­  
ment of artillery. The different mer­  
chant vessels in the harbour wore their  
colours half mast both this and the pre­

Delivered by Gouverneur Morris,  
At the interment of Gererat Hamitron.  
  
Fettow Civizens.  
  
F on this sad, this solemn occasion,  
I should endeavor to move your  
com miseration, it would be doing injus-  
  
tice to that sensibility which has been  
  
so generally and so justly manifested.  
Far from attempting to excite your emo-  
tions, I must try to repress my own,  
and yetI fear that instead of the lan-  
guage of a public speaker you will hear  
only the lamentations of a bewailing  
friend. But I will struggle with my  
bursting heart, to pourtray that ‘heroic  
spirit, which has flown to the mansions  
of bliss.  
  
Students of Columbia—he was in the  
ardent pursuit of knowledge-in your  
academic shades, when the first sound.  
of the American war called him to the  
field. A young and unproteced volun-  
teer, such was his zeal, and so brilliant  
his service, that we heard his name be-  
fore we knew bis person. It seemed if  
God had called him suddetfiy into exis-  
tence , that he might assist to save a  
  
| world!  
  
The-penetrating eye of Washington  
soon perceived the manly ‘spirit which  
animated his youthful bosom. By that  
  
excellent judge of men, he was selected  
  
as an aid, and thus he became early ac-  
quainted with, and was a principal ac-°  
tor in the most. important scenes of our  
revolution. artic Me:  
  
At the siege of York, he pertinacious-  
  
| ly inSisted—-and he obtained the com- |  
  
  
  
  
  
  
mand of a Forlorn Hope. He storm  
ed the redoubt; but let it be recordeg  
that not one single man of the enemy  
perished. His gallant troops emula.  
ting the heroism of their chief, checked  
ihe uplifted arm, and spared a foe no  
longer resisting. Here closed his mili.  
tary career.  
  
Shortly after the war, your favor——  
no, your discernment called him to pub.  
lic office. You sent him to the conven.  
tion at Philadelphia: he there assisted  
in forming that constitution which js  
now the bond of our union, the shield  
of our defence and the source of our  
prosperity. In signing that compac  
he expressed his apprehension that it  
did not contain sufficient means of  
strength for its own preservation ; an  
that in consequence we should share the  
fate of many other republics and pa  
  
} through Anarchy io Despotism. We  
  
‘collect. the conflict of opinion—al  
  
hoped better things. We confided in  
the good sense of the American people  
and above all we trusted in tise protect  
ing Providence of the Almighty. Or  
this important subject he never conceal  
ed his opinion. He disdained conceal.  
ment. Knowing the purity of hish  
he bore it as it were in his hand, expe  
sing to every passenger its inmost re  
cesses. This generousindiscretion sub  
jeGted him to censure from misrep  
sentation. His speculative opinion:  
were treated as deliberate designs ; an  
yet you all know how strenuous, how un  
remitting were his efforts to establi  
and to preserve the constitution. If  
then, his opinion was wrong, pardc  
oh! pardon that single error, in a li  
devoted to your service,

undeserving. This exposed him to

The penetrating eye of Wamington foon  
perceived the manly fpirit which animated bis  
y outhful bofoin. By. that excellent judge of  
men he was feleled as an Aid, and thus he  
became&#x27; early .-acquainted with and was a  
principal actor in the nioft important fcehes  
of our Revolution.

but let it be recorded that not one.fwgle  
man of the-enemy peiiflied. His gallant  
troops emulating the heroifm of their chief,  
checked the uplifted arm, and fpared a foe  
no longer refitting. -Here ctofed his miUta,

Shortly after the war, your favour no,  
your difcernment calred him to publick of

Philadelphia : he there affitted in forming  
that- confliiution which is -now the bond of

You well remember &quot;the ftite of things  
which again called forth Wamington from  
his retreac to lead your armies. You know  
that lie afked for Hamilton to be his fecand  
in command: That venerable faue knew the  
dangerous incidents of a nulitary proietfion,  
and he teit the hand or time pinching life at  
its fource. It was probable that he would

Delivered extempore, by the Hon. Governevr  
Morris, at the interment of General  
Avexanper Hamitron.  
  
Ferrow-Citizens,  
  
IF on this fad, this folemn occafion, I  
fhould endeavor to move your commifera-  
tion, it would be doing injuftice to thar  
fenfibility which has been fo —e and  
fo juftly manifefted. Far from attempt-  
ing to excite your emotions I muft try to  
reprefs my own, and yet I fear that inftead  
of the language of a public fpeaker, you  
will hear only the lamentations of a be-  
wailing friend. But I will ftruggle with  
my burfting heart, to pourtray that He-  
roic Spirit, which has flown to the man-  
fions of blifs.  
  
Students of Columbia—he was in the  
ardent purfuit of knowledge in your aca-  
demic fhades, when the firft found of the  
American war called him to the field. A  
young and unproteéed volunteer, fuch  
was his zeal and fo brilliant his fervice  
that we heard his name before we knew  
  
*  
  
hig yanlonrs]ifpomad nest ombed sale  
  
might aflift to fave a world !  
  
‘The penetrating eye of Wafhington foon  
perceived the manly fpirit which animat-  
ed his youthful bofom. By that excellent  
judge of men he was felected as an Aid,  
and thus he became early acquainted with  
and was principal aétor in the moft impor-  
tant {cenes of our Revolution.  
  
At the fiege of York, he pertinacioufly  
infifted—and he obtained the command of  
2 Forlorn Hope. He ftormed the re-  
doubt ; but let it be recorded that not one  
fingle man of the enemy perifhed. His  
gallant troops emulating the heroifm of  
their chief, checked the uplifted arm, and  
{pared a foe no longer refifting. Here  
clofed his military career.  
  
Shortly after the war, your favor—~no,  
your difcernment called him to public of-  
fice. You fent him to the convention at  
Philadelphia: he there affifted in forming  
that conttitution which is now the bond of  
our union, the fhield of our defence and  
the fource of our profperity. In figning  
that compact he expreft his apprehenfion  
that it did not contain fuflicient means of  
Rrength for its own prefervation ; and that  
in. confequence we fhould fhare the fate of  
many other republics and pafs through  
Anarchy to Defpotifm. We hoped better  
things. We confided in the good fenfe of  
the American people ; and above all we  
trufted in the proteGing Providence of the  
Almighty. On this important fubject he  
never concealed hisopinion. He difdain-  
  
LITERARY TABLET.  
  
ed concealment. Knowing the purity of  
his heart, he bore it as it were in his hand,  
expofing to every paffenger its inmoft re-  
cefles. This generous indifcretion fubjec-  
ed him to cenfure from mifreprefentation.  
His fpeculative opinions were treated as  
deliberate defigns ; and yet you all know  
how ftrenuous, how unremitting were his  
efforts to eftablifh and to preferve the con-  
ftitution. If, then, his opinion was wrong,  
pardon, oh! pardon that fingle error, ina  
life deveted to your fervice.  
  
At the time when our governmient was  
organized, we were without funds, though  
not without refources. To call them into  
action, and eftablifh order in the finances,  
Wafhington fought for fplendid talents,  
for extenfive information, and, above all,  
he fought for fterling, incorruptible integ-  
rity—All thefe he found in Hamilton.—  
The fyftem then adopted has been the fub-  
je&amp; of much animadverfion. If it be not  
without a fault, let it be remembered that  
nothing human is perfect—Recollec the  
circumitances of the moment—recollect  
the confli&amp; of opinion—and above all, re-  
member that the minifler of a republic muff  
bend to the will of the people The admin-  
iftration which Wafhington formed, was  
one of the moft efficient, one of the belt  
that any country was ever bleft with. And  
the refult was a rapid advance in power  
and profperity, of which there is no exam-  
PE nak. a age att aa ;  
which Hamilton bores GaN@Piany ndwn:  
  
His unfufpecting confidence in profef-  
fions which he believed to be fincere, led  
him to truft too much tothe undeferving.  
This expofed him to mifreprefentation —  
He felt himfelf obliged to refign. ‘he  
care of a rifing family, and the narrownefs  
of his fontune, made it a duty to return  
to his profeflion for their fupport. But  
though he was compelled to abandon pub.  
lic life, never, no, never for a moment did  
he abandon the public fervice. He never  
loft fight of your interefts———I declare to  
you, before that God in whofe prefence  
we are now fo efpecially affembled, that  
in his moft private and confidential con-  
verfations, the fingle objeé&amp;s of difcuffion  
and confideration were your freedom and  
happinefs.  
  
You well remember the ftate of things  
which again called forth Wafhington from  
his retreat to lead your armies. You  
know that he afked for Hamilton to be his  
Second in command. That venerable  
fage well knew the dangerous incidents of  
a military profeffion, and he felt the hand  
of time pinching life atitsfource. It was  
probable that he would foon be removed  
from the fcene and that his Second would  
fucceed to the command. He knew, by  
experience, the importance of that place—  
and he thought the fword of America  
might fafely be confided to the hand which  
now lies cold in that coffin. O! my fel-  
low-citizens, remember this folemn tefti-  
monial that he was not ambitious. Yet  
  
  
  
he was charged with ambition &gt; and  
wounded by the imputation, when he laid  
down his command, he declared, in the  
proud independence of his foul, that he  
never would accept of any office, unlefs in  
a foreign war he fhould be called on to  
expofe his life in defence of his country.—  
This determination was immoveable. It  
was his fault that his opinions and his refo.  
lutions could not be changed. Knowing  
his own firm purpofe, he was indignant at  
the charge that he fought for«place or  
power. He was ambitious only of glory,  
but he was deeply folicitous for you. For  
himfelf ke feared nothing, but he feared  
that bad men might, by fallfe profeffions,  
acquire your confidence and abufe it to  
your ruin.  
  
Brethren of the Cincinnati—There lies  
our chief ! Let him ftill’be our model.—  
Like him, after long and faithful publie  
fervice, let us cheerfully perform the focial  
duties of private life. Oh! he was mild  
and gentle. In him there was no offence ;  
no guile. His generous hand and heart  
were open to all,  
  
Gentlemen of the Bar—You have loh  
your brighteft ornament. Cherifh and

has left—ail that the‘e poor orphan chil  
dren will inherit from their father. But,  
my countrymen, that Fame may bea rich  
treafure to you alio. Let it be the telt by

You all know how he perithed. On this

It might excite emotions tco ftrong for

And now ye minifters of the everlafting

At tiie time when our government!  
was organih d, we were without  
funds, though not without refoarces.  
To call them into adlion, and efta-

fault, let it he remembered tfiat no-  
thing human is petfecl — Recoileft  
  
I the circumitanccs qf the moment  
  
recolledl the conflicl of opinion  
  
and, above all, remember that the  
minister of a republic must bend to  
the will of the people. The admini-  
ftration which Wafliington formed,  
was n e of the n.oft efficient, one of the  
heft that any count v-, was ever bleft  
with. And the refult wjs a rajiid  
advance in power and profperity, of  
which there is no example in any o-  
ther age or nation. The part which  
Hamilton bore is univerfally known.  
  
His unfufpef.ing&#x27; confidence in  
profeffions which lie believed to be  
iincerc, led him to truft too much to  
■ he undeferving. This expoHdhiin  
to mifreprefentation. He felt him-  
Hlf obliged to r..(i&gt;n —ft lie care of a  
riling family, and the narrownefs of  
his (ortune, made it a dutv to return  
to his profeflion for their fupport.  
But though he was -compelled to a-  
bandon public life, never, vao,. never  
for a moment did he abandon tlie  
public Lrvicfe. He never loft fight

that in his moll private and confi-  
Jential converfations, the (ingle ob-  
jfcCis of difeuflion and confideration  
vefe your freedom and happinefs.  
  
You will remember the date of  
things which again called forth  
VVafhington from his retreat to lead  
your armies. You k&#x27;rifew that lie  
afltefl for Hamilton to be his fccond in  
command. That venerable fage  
veil knew the dangerous incidents  
if a military profellion, and lie felt  
he hand of time pinching life at its  
lource. It was probable that ha  
.vpuld foon be removed from the  
Icene, and that his fecund would  
lucceedto the command. He knew,  
by experience, the importance of  
that place — and he thought the  
fword of America might ialcty be  
confided to the hand which now lies  
cold in that coffin. Oh ! myfcllow-  
ci’tizens, reme-uber this- Column tefti-  
moivial, that he was not ambitious.  
Yet he was charged with ambition ;  
and wounded&#x27; by the imputation,  
when he laid down his command, he  
declared, in the proud independence  
of his foul, that he never would ac-  
cept of any oflice, unlvfs in a foreign  
ivnr he fliould be called on to expofe  
hisiifc in defence of liiscountry. ft his  
determination was i i-.nioVeablv. It f  
was his fault that his opinions and  
ivis relolutions could not be changed.  
Knowing his own firm purpofe, he  
was indignant at the charge  
  
_ 0 that he  
  
fpught for place or power. He was  
aipbitious only of glory, but he was  
duepli folicitous for you. Eorhim-

and such was the public sentiment at New  
York, the place of interment, that the Gover-  
nor delivered the following Oration previous  
to committing the body to the tomb.—  
FELLOW CITIZENS,  
  
Ir on this sad, this solemn occasion, I  
should endeavour to move your commisera-  
tion, it would be doing injustice to that sensi-  
bility which has been so generally and so just-  
ly manifested. Far from attempting to ex-  
cite your emotions, I must try to suppress  
my own, and yet I fear that instead of the  
language of a public speaker, you will hear  
only the lamentations of a bewailing friend.  
But [ will struggle with my bursting heart,  
to pourtray that heroic spirit which hes  
flown to the mansions of bliss.  
  
Students of Columbia, be was in the ar-  
dent pursuit of knowledge in your academic  
shades, when the first sound of the American  
war called him to the field. A young and  
unprotected volunteer, such was his zeal, and  
so brilliant his service, that we heard his  
name before we knew his person. It seemed  
as if God had called him suddenly into exist-  
ence, that he might assist to save a world!

of men, he was selected as an aid, and thus  
he became early acquainted with, and wasa |  
principal actor in, the most important scenes 7  
of our revolution,  
  
At the’siege of York, he pertinaciously  
insisted, and he obtained the commund of a  
Forlorn Hope. He stormed the redoubt;  
but let it be recorded, that not one single  
man of the enemy perished. His gallant  
troops, emulating the heroism of their chief,  
checked the uplifted arm, and spared a foe  
no longer resisting. Here closed his military  
career,  
  
Shortly after the war, your favour——  
no, your discernment, called him to public of-  
fice. You sent» him to the Convention at  
Philadelphia: he there assisted in forming  
that constitution, which is now the bond of  
our union, the shield of our defence, and the  
source of our prosperity. In signing that  
compact, he expressed his apprehens ion that  
it did not contain sufficient means of strength  
for its own preservation ; and that in conses  
quence we should share the same fate as 7  
many other republics, and pass through anar- 7

We confided in the good sense of the Ameri

were in his hand, exposing to every stranger  
its inmost recesses. This generous indiscre-  
tion subjected him to censure from misrepre-  
sentation. His speculative opinions were  
treated as deliberate designs; and yet you  
all know how strenuous, how unremitting,  
were his efforts to establish and to preserve  
the constitution. If, then, his opinion was  
wrong, pardon, oh! pardon that single error,  
in a life devoted to your service.  
  
At the time when eur government was  
organized, we were without funds, though  
not without resources. To call them into  
action, and establish order in the finances,  
Washington sought for splendid talents, for  
extensive information, and, above all, he  
sought for sterling incorruptible integrity.—  
All these he found in Hamilton, The system  
then adopted has been the subject of much  
animadversion. If it be not without a fault,  
let it be remembered, that nothing human is  
perfect. Recollect the circumstances of the  
moment—recollect the conflict of opinion—  
and, above all, remember, that the mznister  
of a republic inust bend to the will of the people.  
The administration which Washington form-  
ed, was one of the most efficient, one of the  
best that any country was ever blest with.  
And the result was a rapid advance in power  
and prosperity, of which there is no example  
m any other age or nation. ‘The part which  
Hamilton bore is universally known.

which he believed to be sincere, led him to  
trust too much to the undeserving. This ex-  
posed him to misrepresentation. He felt  
himself obliged to resign. The care of a ris-  
ing family, and the narrowness of his fortune,  
made it a duty to return to his profession for  
their support. But though he was compelled  
to abandon public life, never, no, never

You well remember the state of things  
which again called forth Washington from  
his retreat to lead your armies. You know  
that he asked for Hamilton to be his second  
in command. That venerable sage well  
knew the dangerous incidents of a military  
profession, and he felt the hand of time  
pinching life at its source. It was probable  
that he would soon be removed from the  
scene, and that his second would succeed to  
the command. He knew by experience the  
importance of that place; and he thought  
the sword of America might safely be confid-  
ed in the hand which now lies cold in that  
coffin. Oh! my fellow citizens, remember  
this solemn testimonial, that he was not am-  
bitious. Yet he was charged with ambi

the proud independence of his soul, that he  
  
would never accept of any office, unless in a  
foreign war he should be called upon to ex-  
pose his life in defence of his country. This  
determination was immoveable. It was his

firm purpose, he was indignant at the charge  
that he sought for place or power. He

place of interment, that the governor delivered the following  
oration previous to committing the body to the tomb :—  
  
Fettow CITIZENS,  
  
If on this fad, this folemn occafion, I fhould endeavour to  
move your commiferation, it would be doing injuftice to that  
fenfibility which has been fo generally and fo juftly manifefted.  
Far from attempting to excite your emotions, I muft try to fup.  
prefs my own, and yet I fear that inflead of the language of a  
public {peaker, you will hear only the lamentations of a be-  
wailing friend. But I will ftruggle with my burfting heart, to  
pourtray that heroic {pirit which has flown to the manfions of  
bhifs.  
  
- Students of Columbia, he was in the ardent purfuit of know-  
Jedge in your academic fhades, when the firft found of the Ame.  
rican war called him tothe field. A young and unproteéted  
volunteer, fuch was his zeal, and fo brilliant his fervice, that we  
heard his name before we knew his perfon. It feemed as if  
God had called him fuddenly into exiftence, that he might afhift  
to fave a world!  
  
The penetrating eye of Wabhington foon perceived the manly  
{pirit which animated his youthful bofom. By that excellent  
judge of men, he was feleéted as an aid, and thus he became  
early acquainted with, and was a principal a@or in, the moft ime  
portanefcenes of our revolution,  
  
At the fiege of York, he pertinacioufly infifted, and he ob-  
tained the command of a forlorn hope. He ftormed the redoubt ;  
but let it be recorded, that not one fingle man of the enemy pe-  
rifhed. His gallant troaps, emulating the heroifm of their chief,  
checked the uplifted arm, and {pared a foe no longer refitting.  
Here clofed his military career.  
  
Shortly after the war, your favour no, your difcernmenf,  
called him to public offce. You fent him to the convention at  
  
hiladelphia: he there affifted in forming that conftitution,  
  
which is now the bond of our union, the fhicld of our defence,  
  
and the fource of our profperity. In figning that compaét, he

we fhould fhare-the fame fate as many other republi¢s, and pafs  
through anarchy to defpotifm. We hoped better things.  
We confided in the good fenfe of the American people:  
and, above all, we trufted in the prote&amp;ting fpirit of the Al~  
mi¢hty. On this important fubjeét he never concealed his  
opinion. He difdained concealment. Knowing the purity  
of his heart, he bore it as it were in his hand, expofing to  
every ftranger its inmoft receffes. This,generous indifere.  
tion fubjeéled him to cenfure’ from mifieprefentation. His  
fpeculative opinions were treated as deliberate defigns; and  
yet you all know how {trenuous, how unremitting, were his ef.  
forts to eftablifh and to preferve the conftitution. If then, his  
opinion was wrong, pardon, oh! pardon that fingle error, in a  
life devoted to your fervice.  
  
At the time when our government was organized, we were  
without funds, though not without refources. ‘To call them into  
a&amp;tion, and eftablifh order in the finances, Wafhington fought  
for {plendid talents, for extenfive information, and above all, he  
fought for fterling incorruptible integrity.—All thefe he tound  
in Hamilton. The fyflem then adopted has been the fubjeét of  
much animadverfion. If it be not without a fault, let it be re.  
membered, that nothing human is perfect. Recolleét the cir-  
cumftances of the moment—recolle&amp; the conflict of opinion—  
and, above-all, remember, that the minifter of a republic muf  
bend to the will of the people. The adminiftration which  
Wathington formed, was one of the moft efficient, one of the  
beft that any country was ever bleft with. Andthe refult wasa  
rapid advance in power and profperity, of which there is no  
example in any other age or nation. The part which Hamilton  
bore is untverfally known.  
  
His unfufpe@ing confidence in profeffions which he believed  
to be finéére, led him: to truft too much to the undeferving.  
This expofed him to mifreprefentation. He felt himfeif obliged  
to refign. The care of arifing family, and the narrownefs of  
his fortune, made it a duty to return to his proteflion for their  
fupport. But though he was compelled to abandon public life,  
never, no, never for a moment did he abandon the public fers  
vice. Henever loft fight of your interefts.—I declare to you,  
before that God in whofe prefence we are now fo efpecially af-  
fembled, that in his moft private and confidential converfations,  
the fingle objeéts of difcuffion and confideration were your free-  
dom and happinefs.  
  
You well remember the flate of things which again called  
forth Wafhington from his retreat to lead your armies. You  
know that he afked for Hamilton to be his fecond in command.  
That venerable fage well knew the dangerous incidents of a mi-  
  
litary profeffion, and he felt the hand of time pinching life at its  
fource.
