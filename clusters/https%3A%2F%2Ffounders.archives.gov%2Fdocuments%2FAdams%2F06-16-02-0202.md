, and proud, are not in my Eyes to be compared to the Hills of Penn and Neponsit, either in the Grandeur or the Beauty of the Prospects.  
Congress have mortified me a little by cutting off one fifth of my Salary, at a Time when the Increase of my Family rather required an Increase of it. The Consequence of it must be, that I must entertain less Company whereas the Interest of the United States requires, that I should entertain more— There is not a Man in the World less inclined to Pomp or to Entertainments than myself, and to me personally it is a Relief to be excused from both. But if I know any Thing in the World, I know that this Measure is not for the public Good, nor a Measure of Œconomy. If there is any body in America, who understands Œconomy better than the Dutch Nation, I know nothing of either: and their Policy is always upon occasions of Consequence to appoint Ambassadors and even Ambassadors Extraordinary, as they did at the late Peace my Friend Brantzen,  
  
with Seventy five Thousand Guilders, to furnish his House and his Table and Se[venty] five Thousand Guilders a Year to spend in it.— In short that Na[tion] which places its own Ambassadors at the Tail of the whole Creation [cannot] itself expect to be soon at the Head. If this Policy dont expose our [Country] to a Million of insults, and at last compel her by War and Bloodshed to consult better her own Honour, I am much Mistaken. How are we to do? We are to negotiate with all the Ambassadors here—i-e we are to be invited to dine, to morrow at a Table, with Three Thousand Pounds Sterling in Plate upon it, and next day we are to return this Civility, by inviting the same Company to dine with us upon Earthen Ware I am well aware of the motives to this Conduct, which are virtuous and laudable, but we shall find that we cannot keep up

HE consideration which Robert  
Lincoln baa been giving to the  
question of resigning his posi­  
tion as minister to England if,  
a Stab reporter was informed,

Adams was the first represent*­  
tive at the court of St James  
to make this point seriously an  
issue in 1787. Congress cut  
down his salary by one-fifth  
and he wrote to the Depar­  
tment of State a letter saying: &quot;We are  
to dine tomorrow at a table with 8,000  
pounds sterling upon it and the next day
