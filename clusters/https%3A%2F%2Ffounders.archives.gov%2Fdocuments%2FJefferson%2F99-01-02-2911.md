To the President of the United States; and the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.  
The Memorial of the Merchants of the City of New York.  
Your Memoriallists beg leave respectfully to approach the Government of their Country, on subjects of great importance, which have affected their minds, with the deepest anxiety and alarm.  
Confiding in the Justice &amp; friendly dispositions of the Government of Great Britain, and, entertaining a Correspondent expectation, that no unusual restrictions would be imposed on Neutral Commerce, without adequate motives and the most ample notice: presuming especially that Commercial enterprizes, commenced under the sanction of established principles, would on no account be affected by a change of system; Your Memoriallists have employed a Vast Capital, in importing various Colonial productions, the surplus of which, exceeding the demands of this Country, they have been accustomed to Export freely to the different Harbars of Europe.  
After this Commerce had been prosecuted without restriction for several Years, and had attracted a great proportion of their Wealth; after their Insurers had assumed immense responsibilities, grounded on an opinion that this Trade was strictly regular having never received the slightest intimation, that it could be deemed incompatible with the rights of a Belligerent Nation, they have been suddenly confounded by unexpected intelligence of the arrestation on the high Seas, of a large portion of their Property which had been embarked with the most unsuspecting Confidence.  
The feelings of your Memoriallists, are not only excited, by the Loses, which they have actually sustained, in consequence of a measure insusceptible of previous calculation, but also from the state of uncertainty in which they are placed, with respect to future Commercial Operations.  
Your Memoriallists have heretofore believed, that Commerce between the United States, and Colonies subject to the Enemies of Great Britain, when bona fide prosecuted on their own account, would be perfectly safe from interruption, they have also believed, that all the Articles, which might be securely imported into the United States, might be as securely exported; with the exceptions well understood, both in respect to the Import &amp; Export Trade, of Commerce, with places blockaded, or in articles Contraband of War.  
In a recent interpretation of what is considered by the Tribunals of Great Britain as a direct Trade, between the Colonies and the Parent Countries of their Enemies,  Your Memoriallists, perceive with concern, the developement of a principle which if conceeded on the part of the United States, must prove fatal to their commercial importance.  
It is understood to have been decided, that whenever it appears to be the intention of the Importer of Colonial Produce, to export the same  to Europe; or whenever it is so exported by the original Importer, such intention or Exportation, shall be evidence of a direct Trade, and subject the property, tho’ Neutral, to Confiscation.  
Your Memoriallists consider it their bounden duty, to themselves and their Country, to express their most decided opposition to this decision.  
As to the Evidence arising from the supposed intention of an Importer, they readily admit, that the great quantities of Colonial produce of which are acquired by means of the American Commerce, Exceeding the demand for Consumption in the United States, will fairly justify a general presumption, that the surplus, is ultimately destined for European Markets. They assert however that the intention of a Merchant in respect to the future destination of his Property, must, from the nature of things, be inconclusive; all plans of business formed by individuals, are liable to be affected by Circumstances, not to be foreseen or controulled:—these plans are therefore necessarily revokeable by those who form them, and an intention which has not been executed proves nothing more, than might justly be inferred from a general presumption, arising from the Course of our Commerce. To apply such as intention, in a particular Case, to the prejudice of an Individual; to presume that he has voluntarily incurrd an immense risk, which consistently with The success of his main object  he might have fairly avoided, and to involve him in ruin for prosecuting a Trade, which, if undertaken with a different motive, would have been declared lawfull; Would be in the opinion of your Memoriallists, to confound and reverse, the best established principles of Reason, Equity, &amp; Law.  
Your Memoriallists contend for no innovations on the Law of Nations, and except where special Treaties have  prescribed a different rule, they admit that they may Lawfully be restrained from transporting the property of the parties engaged in War: in the recent decision which prohibits an Importer of Colonial produce, from exporting it to Europe, they however perceive with concern, either a nugatory and vexatious regulation, or a meditated blow, at what they deem an incontestable and valuable right.  
Heretofore there existed clear and obvious circumstances of discrimination, between the direct Trade which Great Britain has assumed the right of denying to Neutrals, and the indirect or Circuitous Trade, which She admits to be Lawfull. The direct trade could be performed by a single Shipment or Voyage, whereas the circuitous Trade, subjected the property to double Freights and Insurances to deductions in favour of the Revenue, and various other expences in this Country.  
If the arrival of a Ship in the Country to which it belongs; the landing of the Cargo, the inspection of the Custom House: the payment or security of duties do not terminate a Voyage, then we confess our Ignorance on a point, which never having been before questioned, has been assumed by us as an acknowledged Truth. If the entry for exportation; the embarkation of Merchandize: the Reinspection of the Custom House: the Bond for securing a delivery in a foreign Country, and a public Clearance, do not indicate the commencement of a new Voyage, then we are yet to learn the meaning of the Expression: If all the formalities and sanctions established for the security of our Revenue: If operations of immense magnitude, transacted, with the greatest publicity, and without any motive for concealment, are considered as unreal representations, and merely colourable and fraudulent contrivances to cover an illicit trade, between the Colonies &amp; the Parent Countries of the Enemies of Great Britain, then it becomes necessary, both in regard to our Characters &amp; Interests to enquire, whether the new regulations establish a more definite criterion for the discovery of Truth.    We repel with indignation, the suggestion, that the transhipment of Property, for a foreign market, by the Original importer, is evidence of Fraud or Chicane, or that unsupported by other circumstances, it can justify a Suspicion, that it is other than Neutral. In our opinion any discrimination between the rights of an importing Merchant, and a Vender in the United States, is manifestly fallacious, as it virtually asserts, that the former can exercise only an imperfect dominion over property lawfully acquired, and possessed in this Country, while at the same time he can convey to the latter a Title to a priviledge not enjoyed by himself, in short that a Trade is Unlawfull when the advantage is to result to one person, but may be rendered lawfull by being participated with another.  
If the new Doctrine is executed in the Mildest form, its operation must be highly injurious, by Originating new Questions for litigation, and of course subjecting all our Commerce to new hazards of interruption. We presume not, however, to Comprehend, to what extent, or in what manner the principle will be applied. We perceive that the Antient Land mark, has been removed, but we seek in vain for a Beacon to direct our Course: If We enquire whether a bona fide sale and delivery of Merchandize, by an Importer, being a Citizen, to another known Citizen of the United States, for a Valuable Consideration, will as on ordinary Cases be conclusive Evidence of a transfer of Property, and the answer is affirmative, then we Complain, that our Ships have been detained, the rates of Insurances enhanced, and our Property Confiscated, for the establishment of a rule, which when once understood, will become Nugatory, and cease to produce any Commercial or political effect. If on the other hand this evidence is not to be deemed conclusive, we profess ourselves to be utterly at a loss to discover, what proofs of ownership, and neutrality of property can with safety be relied on.  
But these embarrassments though perplexing &amp; vexatious, are not those which principally occassion our solicitude: We are compelled to consider the late decisions of the British Tribunals, as preliminary steps toward a System for Controuling the importations &amp; Exportations of Colonial Productions, and thereby Annihilating the most lucrative branches of our foreign Commerce.  
If We owed this Trade solely to the favour of Great Britain still we might ask what urgent motive, what imperious necessity, required that the favour should be resumed at a period when our Commerce was spread over the Ocean, and when a Change so essential might destroy its security and subject us to incalculable losses.  
We deny however that the rights of Commerce as Claimed by us, are to be deemed favours: on the contrary, if the Law of Nations is other than a temporary rule, prescribed by an arbitrary Will, and enforced by Power, then We appeal to its most universal and inviolable principle in our defence.—This principle is, that the goods of a Neutral consisting of articles not contraband of War, in a Neutral Vessel, employed in a direct Trade, between Neutral Countries, and Ports of a Belligerent Country not invested or blockaded, are protected.  
In the Controversies which have existed at different times for extending the priviledges of Neutral Vessels, and limiting the grounds of Capture, we take no part: we appeal to the old Law: If neutral rights can be reduced within more confined limits than this Law prescribes, we perceive not, how amidst the Collisions of National Interests, any Neutral Commerce can exist, even in our Native productions.  
If it be intimated that Neutrals should be Confined to a Commerce, with such places, and in such articles only, as were allowed in Peace, by the municipal regulations of the Countries engaged in War! the Doctrine may be repelled by the notorious fact, that no such principle has governed the Conduct of Nations, during any Wars, in which they have been engaged; all were free to vary, and all in fact have varied, their Commercial Systems: whatever theoretical opinions, may therefore have been advanced, there has existed no such practical Rule, and to set up such a Rule, under the unparaleled Circumstances of the present War, must infallibly destroy the Commerce of this Country.  
It is a well known fact, that the people of the United States, export to foreign Countries, a greater proportion of the aggregate annual Value of the products of their industry, than any other people of the Globe; They are consequently most deeply interested in the Security and freedom of their Trade; In short being almost exclusively an agricultural &amp; Commercial People, those parts of our Country, which from recent settlement or from other Circumstances are wholly Agricultural, are more immediately interested than any other, as they are in a greater degree dependent on foreign Supplies, and consequently most liable to be affected, by any Vibrations of the Commercial System.  
As Our Manufactures do not flourish in proportion to the progress of our population, Wealth, and Luxury, the necessity of extending our Commerce is constantly encreasing.  
The basis of all our Trade is the agregate Value of our Native productions exceeding what are Consumed in the United States; these are Exported to Various Countries; from which we receive supplies for domestic use; or other Articles for Exportation; a very great proportion of all the results of our Commerce with the World, Center in the dominions of Great Britain, and we receive, almost exclusively from that Country, our Cloathing and other necessary Manufactures.  
By the Events of the late and present War, many Countries with which we prosecuted an encreasing Trade have been either diverted from Manufacturing Pursuits, or have been greatly impoverished; or Conquered and subjected to the Colonial system of Great Britain.  
With these preliminary facts in View: We request permission to detail some of the most important Consequences of the assumed Rule, that Neutrals may be restrained in Time of War, to their accustomed Trade in time of Peace. The injustice of such a rule in relation to the United States, will be most manifest; The individuals employed in Commerce would not alone be affected: all the internal relations of our Country would be disturbed; the Interests of those Districts which are most remote from our principal Ports would in proportion to their dependence on foreign supplies be  most severely depressed.  
The effects of War, cannot be confined to the Countries engaged in War; the value of money; the price of Labour; the rates of Freight and Insurance, are by War enhanced throughout the World: all articles of Merchandize both of Export &amp; Import, are variously affected, in their Quantities &amp; Value, by new wants; by the relinquishment of former pursuits; and by the new direction which is thereby given, to the Industry of different Nations.    Other Consequences result from the effects of War, as the impoverishment of some, and the aggrandizement of other Countries; Also from the acknowledged right of Belligerent Nations to interdict Commerce in Contraband articles, and to institute Blockades. This last right is highly injurious to Neutrals, as it frequently restrains them from proceeding to the best markets. It is obviously impossible, therefore, to confine the United States in time of War amidst all these disadvantages, to  their accustomed trade in time of Peace; without destroying all Trade.  
If in Consequence of the War, certain Articles usually exported from the United States, to Countries from which we received  Necessary supplies, cease to be demanded in those Countries; may we not export other articles, and thereby obtain the supplies we need?  
If articles usually imported into the United States in time of Peace, cease to be demanded by us in time of War, in Consequence of our ability to obtain substitutes which we prefer; shall we be required to renounce our Export Trade, by being forbid to import other articles for Consumption or for Commerce? or shall we be compelled to receive in Exchange articles which we do not require?  
If in consequence of an encreased demand for our Exports to particular Countries, we obtain in Exchange articles of Commerce exceeding our Domestic Wants; shall it be required that the Surplus perish in our hands?  
If Great Britain permits Commerce between neutral vessels and the colonies of her Enemies may we not with the consent of those Colonies, participate in the same Commerce?  
If our Commerce with the Enemies of Great Britain may now be Confined to the system established in time of Peace, may we not apprehend that the principle will be retaliated in respect to our Commerce with the Colonies of Great Britain? In that Case what can ensue, but War, Pillage and Devastation?  
These are not imaginary suppositions; they illustrate the most important principles of our Commerce; they evince the necessity of a Circuitous Trade, to enable us to realize the Great Value of Exports in our Native productions, by which alone we acquire the power to liquidate the Balance Against us, in our Commerce with Great Britain, they demonstrate, that the position against which we contend, is not a rule of the Law of Nations;—The Law of Nations, ordains no rule, which is  unequal and unjust.  
But still we have other and more forcible objections; the Concession which is required would deprive us of many advantages, Connected wit our local Situation, our Enterprize, our Wealth and our Fortune: it would require us to divert much of our Capital and Industry to new Employments; it would amount to an abandonment of Views, as a Commercial People; and might involve us in dangerous Controversies, by a virtual admission, that any essential Articles of Supply, may, at the pleasure of a Belligerent Nation, be placed in a state of inhibition, equivalent to being declared Contraband of War.  
Hitherto we have regarded it as a peculiar felicity incident to our neutral situation, that it was equally beneficial to ourselves and to all the parties with whom we are connected, The Articles exported by us to the Enemies of Great Britain, being convenient supplies promised to secure to our Ships in their Ports a welcome reception and hospitable treatment; as the direct returns for these exports were inconsiderable, and as the products were almost exclusively remitted to Great Britain and there applied in payment for manufactures purchased on our account, We Considered ourselves sure of receiving from them at least that degree of protection, which was recommended by a regard to mutual Interests.  
It is however with much Surprize, that we have recently discovered that the very Circumstances upon which our hopes of security were reposed, have been urged as arguments to justify an invasion of our rights, and that having totally suppressed the external Commerce of her Enemies, Great Britain is now counselled to appropriate to herself that of her friends. If it be true that as Exporters of certain articles, to the Ultimate markets, our Interests are in Collision with hers, yet it ought to be recollected that, it is a particular and minor Interest only, which suffers, and that the disadvantage is a necessary Consequence of her Colonial system;—that the general results of our Commerce are greatly in her favour; That they invigorate her Manufacturing Interests which are the great basis of her Wealth: and that these Interests can never be promoted by the impoverishment of her best Customers. Surely the security of Neutral Rights ought not to diminish as their value is augmented; Surely a maritime preponderancy, which enables its possessor to blockade, any of the ports of its Enemies, conveys no just title to a monopoly of the Commerce of the World!  
In the list of our Complaints we cannot forbear to enumerate the humiliating and oppressive conduct of Ships of War in the vicinity of our Coasts and Harbours.—We respect the principle, and emulate the Conduct of Great Britain in regard to her own jurisdiction, and we wish merely to Claim for ourselves, the same measure of justice, which She exacts from others.  
But while we contend, that we ought not to be exposed to humiliating inquisitions, in the verge of our Port, which by means of secret Connections with our City, may be rendered conducive to the indulgence of partiality, favour, or malice; We disavow every wish, to divest the Belligerent Nations of their rights. If in particular instances, the American Flag, and the Character of an American Merchant, have been prostituted to unworthy purposes, We declare the individuals thus Guilty to be our Enemies, and we wish not to screen them from the just consequences of their misconduct: We also assert, that a Comprehensive View of our Commerce, affords Conclusive evidence, that of the property Circulated through this Port, the proportion, which can possibly belong to the enemies of Great Britain, is an object unworthy the attention of a Great Power, especially if in a rigorous pursuit of its strict rights, it incurs the hazard of forfeiting the Esteem of its friends.   
If therefore the mode in which the American Commerce is prosecuted, is allowed by the Laws of Nations if irrefragable Evidence arises from our situation, wants, and necessary connections with the rest of the World, that it is almost  exclusively grounded on American Capital; if the suggestions that we are the mere agents of Foreigners, are ungenerous Insults, contrived as apologies for Injuries; if Frauds in relation to Foreign trusts, are not more frequent in this Country, then in Great Britain, and if no Government is able wholly to prevent them; then Our Conclusion in the present as in all other Cases ought to be deduced from General Facts, and not from particular exceptions. This Conclusion is, that the American Commerce, is one of the great Links, which connect those Interests of Civilized Nations, which Wars ought not to disturb; that to break this Link, will be to destroy all Commerce; therefore, that a serious misunderstanding with Great Britain, would prove fatal to the most important Interests of both Countries.  
This View of the subject, while it excites our anxiety, furnishes also a resource for our Hopes; We wish only for Justice, and believing that a Commercial Nation which disregards Justice, thereby undermines the Citadel of her Power, we rely on the effect of mutual Interests and wishes, in promoting a Cordial explanation and fair adjustment of every Cause of misunderstanding: in particular we rely on the Government of our Country, that our rights will not be abandoned, and that no argument in favour of an usurpation will ever be derived from our acquiescence.  
If our personal Interests and local attachments, have not greatly misdirected our opinions, the defenceless situation of the Port of New York, ought to excite the anxious solicitude of every Friend of his Country: our River is the only Commercial Avenue to a fertile &amp; populous Country, which is rapidly rising into importance; it is here that one third of the Revenue of the Union is collected, and this proportion is understood to be relatively increasing. But while we are gratefull for these distinguished advantages of Nature, our satisfaction is diminished by reflecting on their insecurity; for in proportion as the resources of our Country accumulate to this point, is the hazard, that they may present a temptation to Rapacity, and become the Prize of violence. Without recurring to the experience of past times for proofs, that no nation can long maintain an extensive Commerce, without well defended Sea Ports, and an efficient Military Marine We are admonished by the new &amp; portentous aspect of Europe, and the alarming prevalence of Piracy in the West Indies, that energetic measures of defence have become indispensably necessary.   
We presume not to express any opinion respecting the degree of force, of which the permanent Navy ought to consist; and being sensible that delays must attend the Construction of suitable defences, for our Port, we shall rest satisfied, when we perceive that these measures are Commenced in a manner and upon a scale which will assure to us, an efficient completion—  
Such however is the present organized force of the United States, that we should consider it inconsistent with the Honour, Interests, or security of our Country, to parly with the Pirates of the West Indies, whose Conduct being inconsistent with any known rules of Lawful Warfare, cannot have been authorized by any Civilized Nation, towards another nation in a state of Peace.—Our Vessels while pursuing a lawful Trade, have been piratically seized; their Cargoes have been forcibly taken away, and distributed, without even the form of a Trial; the Vessels in many instances sunk and destroyed; and the Crews stripped of all their property. all these Outrages have been exercised on innocent and defenceless men, aggravated by unprecedented Circumstances of Insult, oppression and barbarity. Some of these Violences have been Committed on Vessels, which were Captured within sight of our harbours; and the great scene of these unparralleled Enormities is the Island of Cuba, which Commands the only avenue, by which we preserve a Commercial connection with our Brethren of the Western States: a Connection which we cherish with ardour, as a source of mutual advantage, and a bond of Permanent Union.  
But it is not on account of our pecuniary losses alone, that we Complain, the Constancy and Valour, of the Seamen of the United States are justly themes of Patriotic exultation: from their Connection with us we consider their Cause, as our cause: their Rights, as our Rights: their interests as our Interests: our feelings are indignant at the recital of their Wrongs, and we request, in addition to the protection of a Naval force, that at least in the American Seas, our brave Countrymen, may be permitted to display their Energy in their own defence.—  
Your Memoriallists Conclude with remarking that they deem the present Situation of public affairs to be peculiarly critical &amp; perilous, and such as requires all the prudence, the Wisdom , and Energy, of Government, supported by the Co-operation of all good Citizens. By mutual exertions, under the benign influence of Providence, upon this hitherto favoured Nation, we hope the Clouds, which threaten to obscure its prosperity may be dispelled, and we pledge our united support in favour of all measures adopted to Vindicate and secure the just rights of our Country.  
And your memoriallists as on duty bound will ever pray &amp;c. &amp;c.  
Signed by the Unanimous order, and on behalf of a General Meeting of Merchants, convened on the 26th. December 1805 at the Tontine Coffee House in the City of New York.

on an opinion that this trade was

tion, they have been suddenly con-  
founded, by unexpected intelligence  
of the arrestation, on the high seas,  
of a large portion of their property,  
which had been embarked with the  
most unsuspecting confidence.  
  
The feelings of your memorialists  
are not only excited by the losses  
which they have actually sustained,  
in consequence of a measure unsus-  
ceptible of previous calculation, but  
also from the state of uncertainty in  
which they are placed with respect  
to future commercial operations.  
  
Your memorialists have hereto-  
fore believed, that commerce be-  
tween the United States and colo-  
nies subject to the enemies of Great  
Britain, when dona fide prosecuted  
on their own account, would be per-  
fectly safe from interruption: they  
have also believed, that all articles,  
which might be securely zmported  
into the United States, might be as

Great Britain as a direct trade be-

the developement of a principie,  
which, if conceded on the part of  
the United States, must prove fatal  
to their commercial importance.

MEMORIAL OF THE MERCHANTS OF NEW YORK.

It is understood to have been de-  
cided, that whenever it appears to  
be the intention of the importer of  
colonial produce to export the same  
to Europe, or whenever it is so ex-  
ported by the original importer,  
such intention or exportation shall  
be evidence of a direct trade, and  
subject the property, though neutral,  
to confiscation.  
  
Your memorialists consider it  
their bounden duty to themselves  
and their country, to express their  
most decided opposition to this de-  
cision.  
  
As to the evidence arising ftom  
the supposed intention of an import-  
er, they readily admit; that the great  
quantities of colonial produce which  
are acquired by means of the Ame-  
rican commerce, exceeding the de-  
mand for consumption in the United  
States, will fairly justify @ general  
Lresumfition that the surplus is ulti-  
mately destined for European mar-  
kets. They assert, however, that  
the intention of a merchant, in re-  
spect to the future destination of  
his frroferty, must, from the nature  
of things, be inconclusive. All plans  
of business, formed by individuals,  
are liable to be affected by circum-  
stances, not to be foreseen or con-  
trolled. These plans are, therefore,  
necessarily revokeable by those who  
form them ; and an intention, which  
has not been executed, proves no-  
thing more than might justly be in-  
ferred from a general presumption,  
arising from the course of our com-  
merce. To apply such an intention  
in a particular case, to the preju-  
dice of an individual; to presume  
that he ha¢ voluntarily incurred an  
immense risk, which, consistently  
with the success of his main object,  
he might have fairly avoided, and  
to involve him in ruin for prosecut-  
ing a trade which, if undertaken  
with a different motive, would have  
been declared lawful; would be, in  
the opinion of your memorialists,  
to confound and reverse the best es-  
tablished principles of reason, equi-  
ty, and law.  
  
Your memorialists contend for no  
innovations on the law of nations:

colonies and the parent countries of their  
enemies, your memorialists perceive  
wnii coma m, the developenient of a  
principle, which, if conceded on the  
&#x27;part ofthe United States, must prove  
il to their commercial importance.  
It is understood to have been decided,  
that whenever it appears to be the iuten­  
j tion ofthe importer of colonial produce,  
ito export the same to Europe; or,  
[Whenever it is so exported by the ori­

| Your memorialists consider it their ! -  
! bottnden duly to themselves and tin ir I  
I country, to express their must decided &#x27;  
opposition to this decision.  
.vs to the evidence arising from thi I  
supposed intension of an importer, they :  
readily admit, that the gieat quauti- &#x27;  
ties of colonial produce, which arc ac- &#x27;  
quired by means of the American com­  
mere. ing the demand for con­  
sump ion in the United Mates, will fair­  
ly justify a gent ral presumption that tuc &#x27;  
surplus is ultimately destined for Europe,  
an markets. They assert, however.  
\\w intention of a merchant, i-,, respect i  
tothe per- &#x27;

inconclusive. Ail plans of I

We repel with iiuli-n&#x27;ition the stir-- ;  
gestion, that the tran«.Bhlpmerit of pre- 1  
pertj for a foreign market, by the 1  
original importer, is evidence .if&#x27;fraud &#x27;  
or chicane ; Or that, unsupported by o- &#x27;  
ther circumstances, it can justify a suspi- &lt;  
cion,thatit is ether than neuiral. in &#x27;  
oiir opinion, any discrimination between &#x27;  
the rights of an importing niercha.nl, &amp; &#x27;  
.1 vi ~dee in the United States, is mi ni- &#x27;  
festly fallacious, as it vrrtually asserts, l  
that the farmer can exercise only an l  
iniper eet dominion over properly law- \
fully acquired, ami possessed in this  
country, while at the same time he can \
ey to the hitter a title to a pnvi- \
lege not enjoyed by himself; in short,  
1 v.:n[c is unlawful, when the ad- r  
vantage is to result to one person, but 1  
ma) be rendered lawful, by being parti- c  
cipdtcd with another 11  
it *i   
  
wj&gt;iucu witti another.  
if the new doctrine is executed in  
the mildest form, its operation must be  
highly injurii v ,byoriginating.new ques­  
tions for litigation, and of course, sub-  
U our commerce to new haz­  
ards of interruption. We presume not,  
however, to comprehend, to what ex­  
tent, or In what manner, the principle  
&#x27;will be applied ; we perceive, that tne  
ancient land-mark has b.-en rernt  
hut *■ • : vain for a beacon to di­  
rect our course ;•— If we inquire whether  
a bonafde sale and delivery of mer- :  
chandise, by an importer, being a citi- &#x27;  
zen, to another known citizen of the  
United States,for a valuable considera­  
tion, will, asm ordinary cases,be con­  
clusive evidence of a transfer of pro­  
perty, and the answer is affirmative ;  
then we comphun, that our ships have  
been detained, the rates of instn  
enhanced, and our property confiscated j  
ter the establishment of a &#x27;rule, which, j  
when once understood, will become nu­  
gatory, and cease to produce any com- ,  
mc. vial or political effect. If on &quot;the o- i  
ther hand, this evidence is not to be ,  
deemed conclush c, we profess ourselves |  
to be utterly at a loss to discover, what  
proofs of ownership, and neutrality cf j  
property can with safety he relied on.  
but these embarrassments, though  
perplexing and vexatious, are not those  
which principally occasion our si  
tude. We are compelled to consider j  
the late decisions ofthe British tribu- j  
i nsds, as preliminary steps towards a i  
system tor controlling the importations j  
and exportation* of colonial producti­  
onS, and thereby annihilating the most  
lucrative tranches of our foreign com­  
merce.  
ft we owed this trade solely to the fa­  
vor of G. Britain ; still we might ask,  
what urgent motive, what imperious  
necessity, required that the favor should  
be resumed, at a period when our com­  
rrterce was spread over the ocean, and !  
when a change so essential might dcs- |  
troy its security, and subject us to incal­  
culable h ss ?  
We deny, however, that the rights  
of commerce, as chained by us, are to  
he deemed favours ; on the contrary, if |  
the law ol nations is other than a tom- I  
porary rule, prescribed by an arbitrary  
will and enforced by power, then we j  
appeal to its most universal -and Inviofa- !  
ble prmciblc, in our defence. This !  
principle is, that rhe goods ofti neutral, \
consisting of articles not contraband of  
war,in a neutral vessel, employed in a  
direct trade, between neutral countries,  
and ports of a betlig miry not  
invested or bi ire protected,

not .more, frequent in this country than  
i.i Great Rritain; and if no govern­  
| ment in able wholly to prevent &gt;&#x27;j&gt;  
, tlien. our conclusion in the present, at  
jin &#x27;ill ether cases;, ought to be (h-duced  
from general facts, undwot frqm p  
j cular excepiions. This concbision is,  
that the American commerce is on  
thegreat li j!;.s which connect those 1.1­  
--its of Civilized nations, which wars  
not 10 disturb : that to break this  
link, will be todestroy all coflimj ri c ;  
and therefore, that a serious misunder­  
ding A.&#x27;iih Great Britain would  
■ fatal to the most important inte­  
rests ot both countries.  
This view of the subject, while it ex­  
cites our anxiety, furnishes also a re­  
source for our hepes. We wish onl)  
for justice : and believing that a com­  
mercial nation which disi egardsjustice,  
thereby undermines the citadel of her  
power, we rely on the effect of mutual  
interests and wishes in promoting a cor­  
dial explanation, and fair adjustoientol  
every cause of misunderstanding : in  
particular we rely on the government  
of our country, that our rights will not  
and that no argument in  
favor of ail usurpation will ever be de­  
rived from our acquiescence.  
If our personal interests and localat­  
-1 tachments have not greatly mis-direot­  
&quot; opinions, the defenceless situa­  
tion of the port of -NewvYovk ougtft to j  
excite the anxious schciiude of every  
friend of his country. Our river is the  
only commercial avinue to a fertile and  
populous country, which is rapidly ris­  
ing into importance. It is here chat  
o)ip.third of the revenue of the union is  
; and this proportinn isnn  
stood to be relatively increasing. But j  
while we are grateful for these distiu- ,  
lil advantages of nature, our sa- ,  
i&gt;. -ii 1. . .o. on isle-d, by reflecting on  
their insecurity ; for in proportion as  
tho resources of our country accumu­  
late to this point, is the hazard that they  
may present a temptation to rapacity,  
: ecbme a prize to \ iolence. With­  
out recurring to the experience &lt;&lt;i past  
tinaea for proofs, that no nation can .  
Long maintain an extensive commerce,  
without we&#x27;d defended sea-ports, and an  
efficient military marine, we are ad­  
monished by the new and portentous as­  
pect of Europe, and the alarming pre*  
ice of piracy in the.VV. Indies, that  
energetic measures of defence, have be­  
try.  
VYe presume not to express any opi­  
nion respecting the degree of force of | &#x27;  
which the permanent navy ought to  
consist; and being sensible that delays  
must attend the construction of suitable  
defence:-: for our port, we shall rest sa­  
tisfied when we perceive that these  
i;hs are commenced, in a manner, ,  
and upon a scale, which will assure to  
us an efficient completion.  
Such, however, is the present orga­  
nized, force of the U. S. that we should  
consider it inconsistent with the honor,  
1 inter eurity of cur country, to  
parley with the pirate* of the VV. In­  
dies, wh«tse concoct being inconsistent  
with any known rules of lawful warfare,

To the President of the United States, and the Se­  
nate and house of Representatives of the United  
States of America, in Congress assembled : the  
memorial of the merchants of the citv of Ncw­  
York.  
Your memorialists beg leave respectfully to ap­  
proach the government of their country, on subjects  
of great importance, which have affected their nunds  
with the deepest anxiety and alarm.  
Confiding in the justice and friendly dispositions of  
the government 01 Great Britain, and entertaining  
a correspondent expectation that no unusual restric­  
tions wc uld be imposed on neutral commerce, w ith­  
out adequate motives and the most ample notice ;  
presuming especially, that commercial enterprises,  
commenced under the sanction of established piin­  
ciplcs, would on no account be affected by a change  
of system ; your memorialists have employed a vast  
capital in importing v irions colonial productions, the  
surplus of which, exceeding the demands of this  
country, they have been accustomed to export free­  
ly to the different markets of Europe.  
After this commerce had been prosecuted with­  
out restriction for several years, and had attracted  
a great proportion of their wealth ; after their in­  
surers had assumed immense responsibilities, ground­  
ed on an opinion, that this trade was strictly rc--u­  
lar ; having never received the slightest intimation,  
that it could he deemed incompatible with the rights  
of a belligerent nation, they have been suddenly con­  
founded, by unexpected intelligence of the arresta­  
tion on the high seas, of a large portion of their pro­  
perty-, which had been embarked with most unsus­  
pecting confidence.  
The feelings of your memorialists are not only  
excited, by tiic losses which they have actually sus­  
tained, in consequence of a measure unsu iceptibl?  
of previous calculation, hut also from the state of  
uncertainty in which they are placed, wuh respect  
to future commercial operations.  
Your memorialists have heretofore believed, that  
commerce between the U. Stales and colonies sub­  
ject to the enemies of Great-I!.-tain, when loro f&#x27;\­  
prosecuted on their own account, would be pence&#x27;.!­  
safe from interruption : they have also believed, that  
all articles, which might he securely im&#x27;.oricd into  
the United States, might be as recurelv rs-fiartrd ;  
with the exception well understood, Loth in rev ert  
to the import and export trade, a commerce with  
places blockaded, or in articles contraband of war.  
In « recent interpretation cf what is consideied  
by the tribunals cf Great Britain a.? a direct traa&#x27;-\
  
uciwccu uic canines ami tnc parent countries futheir  
enemies, \otir memorialists perceive with ccncern  
tTic.* den loocinent of a principle, which, it conceded  
on the pari of the United States, must prove fatal to  
their c.on,merci.i! importance.  
It is understood to have been decided, that when­  
ever it appears to be the intention of the importer,  
rr ch intention of exportation, shall be evidence of a  
direct trade, and subject the property, though neu­  
tral, to confiscation.  
Your memorial! ts consider it their bounden duty  
to themselves and their country, to express their  
most decided opposition to this decision.  
As the evidence arising from the supposed intenti­  
on of an importer, they readily admit, that the great  
quantities of colonial produce, which are acquired by  
means of the American commerce, exceedin&#x27;-- the  
demand for consumption in the United States, will  
fairly justify a general /ircuuinfllicn, that the surplus  
is ultimately destined for European markets. They  
assert, however, that the intention of a merchant,  
in respect to the future destination of his f.rcfierty,  
must, from the nature of things, be inconclusive._  
All plans of business, formed by individuals, are lia­  
ble to be affected by circumstances, not to he fore­  
seen or controlled :—these plans are therefore neces.  
sarily revokable by those who form them ; and an  
intention which has not been executed, proves no­  
, thing more than might justly be inferred from a ge­  
neral presumption, arising from the course of our  
1 commerce. To apply such an intention, in a par­  
ticular case, to the prejudice of. an individual ; to  
presume that he has voluntarily incurred an immense  
risk, which, consistently with the success of his main  
object, he might have fairly avoided, and to involve  
him in ruin for prosecuting a&#x27;trade, which, if under­  
taken with a different motive, would have been de­  
clared lawful ;—would be, in the opinion of your rne­  
morialists, to confound and reverse the best establish­  
ed principles of reason, equity, and law.  
Your memorialists contend for no innovations on  
the law of nations ; and, except where special trea­  
ties have prescribed a different rule, they admit that  
they may lawfully be restrained from transporting  
the property of the parties engaged in war; in the  
recent decision which prohibits an importer of colo­  
nial produce from exporting it to Europe, they how­  
ever perceive with concern, either a nugatory and  
vexatious regulation, or a meditated blow, at what  
they deem an incontestible and valuable right.  
Heretofore there wtUted clear and uuVioos cir­  
  
cumstances of discrimination, between the direct  
&#x27;rade, which Great-Britaili has assumed the rio-ht  
if denying to neutrals, and the indirect or circuitoua  
■rade wh’ch she admits to he lawful. The direct  
‘rade could be performed hv a single shipment or  
I&#x27;oyage ; whereas, the circuitous trade subjected‘he  
property to double freights and insurances, to deduc­  
tions in favour of the revenue, and various other ex­  
peaces in this country.  
If the arrival of a ship in the country to which it  
belongs ; the landing of the cargo ; the’inspection of  
the Custom-House ; the payment or security of du­  
ties ; do not terminate a voyage—then we confess  
our ignorance on a point, which, never having seen  
before questioned, has been assumed by us as an ac­  
knowledged truth. If the entry for exportation ; the  
embarkation of merchandize ; the rc-inspcction of  
the Custom-House ; the bond for securing a delive­  
ry in a foreign country, and a public clearance, do  
not indicate a commencement of a new voyage, then  
we tire yet to learn the meaning of the expression_  
It all the formalities and sanctions established far the  
security of our revenue; it opci ations of immense  
magnitude, transacted with the greatest publicity, i  
and without any motive for concealment, fire consid­  
ered as unreal representations, and merely coloura­  
ble and fraudulent contrivances to cover an illicit  
|tr.ide, between the colonics and the parent countries  
of the enemies of Grcat-Bcitain ; then it becomes  
necessary, Lath in regard to cur characters and in­  
terests, to inquire, whether the new regulations es­  
tablish a more definite criterion for the&#x27;discovery of  
Until ? 1  
  
v\ e repel with indignation the suggestion, that the  
trans-shipment of property for a foreign market, by  
the original importer, i: evidence of fraud or chicane  
—or that, unsupported by other circumstance, it can  
Ju&#x27;t.a stispu ion,tout it isother tiiur.giKii.iral, Incur  
cpidion, any discrimination between the rights of an  
importing merchant, and a vendee in the U. States,  
is manifestly fallacious, as it virtually asserts, • •  
tlie former can exercise only an imperfect ibn.i u i  
over property lav; fully a com red, ami porscaaed ia  
this country, while at the sa.uc time lie can -:c.;.vepi  
to the latter a title to a j rivibgc not enjoyed by hinwS  
self; in short, that a trade is unlawful, when the  
advantage is to result to one person, but nu.y be ren­  
dered lawful, by being participated with another.  
If the new dec trie its executed in the mildest form,  
its operation must be highly injurious, by originating  
new questions for litigation, and of course, s-blttC. a  
ting all our commerce^new hazardSljf IhterrupiTdn.  
We presume not, he sever,. to comprehend, to chat  
extent, or in what manner, tlie principle will be ap­  
plied ; wc perceive, that thejtocicnc laud mark has.  
been removed, but wc s«lt W Vain for a bececu to  
direct our course ; if wefnqutre whether a bone, f.de  
sale and delivery of merlin.n lice, In an impener  
being a citizen, to another known citizen of the Uni­  
ted St.ites, fora valuable consideration, will, as in  
ordinary cases, be conclusive evidence of a transfer  
of property ,ytnd the answer is in tlie affirmative; tests  
we complain, that our ships have been detained toe  
rates of insurance enhanced, and our propt.i t ’con­  
fiscated, for the establishment of a rule, which, when  
once un.&#x27;erstr.td, will become nugatory, and cease to  
produce any commercial or political effect. If o.i the  
other hand, this evidence is not tube deemed con­  
clusive, we profess ourselves to be utter!/ at ii iJss  
to discover, what proofs of ownership, and ncutial­  
ity of property, can with safety be relied on.  
But tnese cuioarressments, though perplexing and  
vexatious, ai c not t.uisc i.nich principally occasion  
our solicitude. We are compelled to consider the 1 &gt;.te  
decisions of the British tribunals, us preliminary steps  
towards a system tor contzouliing the import-:&#x27;ions  
and exportations of colonial productions, and th.rcbv  
annihilating the most lucrative branches of our fo­  
reign commerce.  
If we owed this trade solely to the favour cfGreat­  
Britr.;n, stul we might ask, what urgent motive,  
what imperious necessity, required that the fav..u­  
should be resumed, at a period when cur commerce  
was snreud o-.cr the ocean, am! v hen a change so es­  
sential might destroy its security, and subject us to  
inculcula! !e losses ?  
We deny, however, that tlie rights of commerce,  
as claimed by us, are to be deemed favours; on the  
contrary, if the law of nations is other than a tempo­  
ral&quot;- rule, prescribed by an arbitrarv will, and enfor­  
ced bv power, then wo appeal to its most universal  
“■•ci invio.aUe principle, in our defence. This prin­  
Cipie is. that the goods of a Mhuts.u, ccrtsistinr

NEUTRAL COUNTRIES, a:ul fiOTtS &#x27;fa BKLLIGK­  
cor.nsv not invested or blockaded,

In he controversies which have existed at differ­  
ent times, for rxU-n nng the privileges of neutral v t  
re&#x27;s, and limit&#x27;.: : the grounds of capture, we take r.»  
part: we appeal. tD the old law. If i.untr .1 , igbts c&#x27; *  
bo , educed wit! in more ccrcmed lirrils thar, tins : v/  
! prercrifcoT, we perceive not how, amidst the c .1,} i­  
°ns of national interests, any neutral commerce can  
exi&#x27;t, even in cur native prcduut/or.s.  
If it he intimated, that neutrals shi.uUI.be confined  
to a commerce with such places, and m such articles  
only, as vere allow el in peace, by tne municipal re­  
gu.atk a if ii.s countries engaged in war; the doc­  
trine may be. repelled by the nuco.-ious fart, that no  
1 such piirci . le hzs governed the conduct of nations,  
i di&#x27;.rh g any wars in which thev have been eiv&lt; a -  
all were free to vary, .and all in fact have vorfor .sir  
I commercial systems: whatever theoretical opinion*  
may therefore have been advanced, there has existed  
no such practical rule, and to setup such a rule, un­  
der the Lnparral&#x27;e&#x27;ed circumstances of the present  
war, must infallibly destroy the commerce of thi«  
  
country.  
It is a v&gt;el! known fact, that the people of the Uni­  
ted States export to foreign countries a greater pro­  
no-t:on of the *ggi agate value cf the pi mlar.ts of their  
industry, than any ether ps-cpie of the globe ; they  
are cc.r oeycertly r-.nvit deeply interested in the secu­  
rity and irerdom oi their trade; in short, being al­  
most exclusively an agricultural and commercial peo- ,  
pie, these pat U of our country, which, from recenc  
settlement, or from i.thyr circumstances, sre wholly  
agricultural, are more imineeiately interested than  
any oilier, as they are in a greater degree dependent  
on foreign supplies, and consequently most liable t»  
be affected, by any vibrations of the commercial sya­  
teni.  
As our manufactures do not flourish in proportion  
to the progress of our population, wealth and luxury,  
the necessity of extending our commerce is constant­  
ly increasing.  
The basis of all our trade is the aggerate value of  
our native productions, exceeding what are consu­  
med in the United States: these are exported to va­  
rious countries, from which we receive supplies for  
domeshek use, or other articles for exportation. A  
very great proportion of all the results of our com­  
merce with the world, centre in the dominions of Great  
Baitain, and we receive almost exclusively from that  
country, our cioathing, and other necessary manu­  
factures.  
By the events of the late and present war, many  
countries with which we prosecuted an increasing  
trade, have been either diverted from manufacturing  
pursuits, or have been greatly impoverished, or con­  
quered and subjected to the colonial system of Great  
Britain.  
With these preliminary facts in view, we request  
permission to detail some of the most important con­  
sequences of the assumed rule,/Aar neutrals nicy it

in time of fieoee. The injustice of such a rule in re­  
lation to tjie United States, will be more manifest:  
the individuals employed in commerce, would not a­  
lone be- affected: all the internal relations of our  
country would be disturbed: the interests of those  
districts which are most remote from our principal  
ports, would, in proportion to their dependence on  
foreign supplies, he most severely depressed.  
The effects of war cannot be confined to the coun­  
tries engaged in war. The value of money ; the  
price of labour; the rates of freight and insurance,  
are by war enhanced throughout the world : all ar­  
ticles of merchandize, both of export and import, are  
variously affected in their quantities and value, by  
Ircw wants; by the relinquishment of former pursuits  
and bv the new direction which is thereby given to  
the industry of different nations. Other consequen­  
ces result from the effects of war; as the impoverish­  
ment of some, ar.d the aggrandizement of other  
countries: also, from the acknowledged right of bel­  
ligerent nations to interdict commerce in contraband  
articles, and to institute blockades. This last right  
is highly injurious to neutrals, as it frequently re­  
strains them from proceeding to the best markets.—.  
It is obviously impossible, therefore, to confine the  
Uilited btates, in time of war, amidst all these chan­  
ges and disadvantages to their acciutzmed trade in  
time of&#x27;/ieace, without dentroiiirr? ull trad  
If, in consequence of the war, certain articles usu­  
ally exported from the United States to countries  
t om which we received necessary supplies, cease to  
t.i demanded in those countries, may we not export  
o&#x27;her articles, and thereby obtain the supplies we  
  
lie.:: I  
If articles usually imported into the United States  
in time of peace, cease to he demanded by us in time  
c: war, in consequence of our ability to obtain sub­  
9’itutes which wt prefer, shall we be required to re­  
j.ranee our export trade, by being forbid to import  
tuner articles for consumption or commerce ? or shall  
vr be compelled to receive in exchange, articles  
v vh we do not require?  
if in consequence of an increased demand for our  
exports to p articular countries, we obtain in ex­  
cr...n~c, articles of commerce exceeding our domes­  
t.:\ wants, shall it be required that&#x27;the surplus pe­  
Tv h on our hands ?  
If Great-Britain permits commerce between her  
subjects and the colonies of her enemies, may we  
not, with the consent of those colonies, participate in  
the same commerce ?  
If o&#x27;Ur commerce with the enemies of Great-Bri­  
toTo tit iy r.ow be confined to the system estab­  
)i‘hcd in time of peace, may we not apprehend that  
the principle will be retaliated in respect to oar com­  
merce with the colonies of Great-Britain ? In that  
cq.e, what can ensue but war, pillage, and devasta­  
tion ?  
These are not immnginary suppositions : they il­  
lufrite the most important principals of our com­  
merce : they evince the necessity of a circuitous  
tr V, to enable us to realize the great value of ex­  
]&gt;&quot;- t» in our native productions, by which alone we  
ac quire the power to liquidate the balance against  
vs. i : our commerce with Great-Britain : they de­  
monstrate, that the position against which we con­  
tend, is not a rule of the law of nations which ordains  
no rule which is unequal and unjust.  
i*at Mill we have other and more forcible objecti­  
on.-; the concession which is required, would de­  
t iitusnf many advantages, connected with our  
1. c-.! situation, our enterprise, our wealth, and our  
f c me; it would require us to cii\ert much of our  
&lt;■ a.;t 11 and industry to new employments ; it would  
to an abandonment of views, as a cotnmer­  
€i i people, and .l ight involve admission, that any  
nr 1 r.r‘.ic)e« of supply may at the pleasure of a  
fcvliir? vr.. anti m, lie pi ict d in a state of inhibition,  
•qu&#x27;v.pcnt to being declared contraband of war.  
H ,&#x27;fo wt have regarded it as a peculiar felici­  
ty ini Went s , our neutral siiuation, that it was equal­  
ly benefit ial to ourselves, and to all the parties with  
Uttem we are connected : the articles exported by  
ns to the enemies of Great-Britain, being convenient  
supplies, promised to secure to our ships in their  
ports a well onie reception and hospitable treatment.  
■As the direct returns f &gt;r these exports were incon-&#x27;  
aider ..ble, and as the products were almost exclu­  
sively remitted to Great-Britain, r.r.d thereby ap­  
pue I in p.-yment for manufactures purchased on our  
account, we considered ourselves sure of receiving  
Turn tiirni, at least, that degree of protection, which  
ts &#x27;.&#x27;i.&quot;...amended by a regard to nmnrd interests,  
a&#x27; f t&#x27;n wever with mucii surprise that we have  
vers- ■ v di-&gt; „vered, that the very circumstances up­  
on which or hopes of security were reposed, have  
been u&#x27;-ged ns argument1! to j ustify an invasion of our  
Tiidiis, and that, having tot illy suppressed the exter­  
*&#x27;•’ icrce of her enemies, Great-Brit uu is now  
r .• ,&lt;«cd t i appropriate to herself that of her  
lti-.n !Ii it Irf- true that, as exporters of certain  
: • &#x27; » the ultimate markets, our intere-tr, are  
i;i &lt; o;.i &gt;n with hers, yet it ought to be recollected  
ttv.t it i&gt;. s y &#x27;rt.cub r and minor interest only which  
•u-ilers, end that t.i; disadvantage is a necessary  
cej-vq•■* &#x27; f h. r c &gt;! mini system : that the gene*  
r.l of. i:r commerce are greatly In her fa*  
vw.tr : tl. it ’..icy invigorate her manufacturing inter­  
est I, •- bii.i are the great basis of her wealth : and  
t’ of. a -s interests can never be promoted by the  
i-&#x27;.j *•»•* I&#x27;isiiinent ofh.er best customers. “ Surely the  
f vv - of neutral rights ought not to diminish, as  
tt&#x27;.i: v due* is augmented : surely a maritime pre­  
jm.ide-ancy, which enables its possessor to blockade  
ehy of the ports of its enemies, conveys no just title  
to a litoiionoly ,;f the commerce of the world !  
In tbs list-of our complaints, we cannot forbear to  
« r .&#x27;rate the humiliating and oppressive conduct of  
t.V.cs of war, in the vicinity of cur coasts and har­  
bours. Vde respect the principle, and emulate the  
conduct cl Great-Britain, in regard to her own juris­  
(■t&#x27;cti &lt;n, end we wish merely to claim for ourselves  
tre same measure of justice which she exacts from  
  
c: &#x27;firs;  
£ut while we contend that we ought not to be ex­  
j&#x27;.,sed to humiliating inquisitions in the verge of our  
j,. rt, whii h by means of secret connexions with our  
may h.- rendered conducive to the indulgence of  
5, rtiah.v, favour, or malice, wc disavow every wish  
11 divest the belligerent nations of their rights. If, in  
| ..rticular instances, the American flag, aud the  
character of an American merchant, have been  
prostituted to unworthy purposes, we declare the  
individuals thus guilty to be our enemies, and we  
wf.lt not to screen them from the just consequences  
of their misconduct. We also assert, that a com­  
prehensive view of our commerce, affords, conclu­  
sive evidence that of the property circulated  
through this port, the proportion which can possibly  
bc&#x27;rug to the enemies of Great Britain, is an object  
tu,worthy the attention of a great power ; especially,  
U in a rigorous pursuit of its strict rights, it incurs  
the h.&#x27;.t.’.rd of forfeiting the esteem of its friends.  
If, therefore, the mo«!e in which the American  
commerce is prosecuted, is allowed by the law of na­  
tions ; if irrefragable evidence asises from our situ­  
sttioo, wants, and necessary connexions with the rest  
of the world, that it is almost exclusively grounded  
on American capital; if the suggestions, that wc are  
the mere agents of foreigners, are ungenerous in­  
isilts, .contrived ns apologies for injuries ; if frauds  
ir. relation to foreign trusts, are not more frequent in  
tills country than in Great Britain ; and if no go­  
vernment is able wholly to prevent them : then our  
conclusion in the present, as in all other cases, ought  
to be deduced from general facts, and not from par­  
ticular exceptions. This conclusion is, that the A­  
me;ican commerce is one of the great links which j  
  
connect those interests of civilized nations, which !  
wars ought not to disturb : that to break this link,  
will be to destroy all commerce ; and therefore, that  
a serious misunderstanding with Great Britain would  
prove fatal to the most important intSrcsts of both  
countries. j  
This view of the subject, while it excites onr anx­  
iety, furnishes also a resource for our hopes. We  
wish only for justice : and believing that a commer­  
cial nation which disregards justice, thereby under­  
mines the citadel of her power, we rely on the effect  
of mutual interests and wishes in promoting a cor­  
dial explanation, and fair&#x27;adjustment of every cause  
of misunderstanding : in particular, we rely on the  
government of our country, that oar rights will not  
lie abandoned, and that no argument in favour of an  
usurpation will ever be derived from our acquies­  
cence. . . .......  
If our personal interests and local attachments  
have not greatly mi ,-directed our opinions, the de­  
fenceless situation, of the port of New York, ought  
t° excite the anxious solicitude of every friend of his  
country. Our river is the only commercial avenue  
to a fertile and populous country, which is rapidly ris­  
ing into importance. It is here, that one.third of the  
revenue of the Union is collected ; and this propor­  
tion is understood to be relatively increasing.—But  
wmle we are grateful for these distinguished advan­  
tages of nature, our satisfaction is diminished by tc­  
fleetingon their insecurity ; for in proportion as the  
resources of our country accumulate to this point, is  
the hazard, that they may present a temptation to  
rapacity, and become ,thc prize of violence. With­  
out recurring to the experience of past times for  
proofs, that no nation can long maintain an-exten­  
sive commerce, without well defended sea-ports, and  
an efficient military marine, we are admonished  
l\V the new and portentous aspect of Europe, and the  
alarming prevalence of piracy in the West-Indies,  
that energctick measures of defence have become in­  
  
y IlCCCSSiil ) •  
We presume not to express any opinion respect­  
ing the degree of force, of which the permanent na­  
\ y ought to consist ; and being sensible that delays  
mast attend the construction of suitable defences for  
our port, we shall rest satisfied, when we perceive  
that those measures are commenced in a manner, and  
upon a single scale, which will assure to us an effici­  
ent completion.  
Such however, is the present, organized force of  
the United States, that we should consider it incon­  
sistent with the honour, interests, or security of our  
country, to parley with the pirates of the West In­  
dies, whose conduct being inconsistent with any  
known rules of lawful warfare, cannot have been  
authorised by any civilized nation towards another  
nation, iri a state of peace. Our vessel, while pur­  
suing a lawful trade, have been piratically seized,  
their cargoes have been forcibly taken away and dis­  
tiihuted, without even the form of a trial ; the ves­  
sels in many instances sunk and destroyed, and the  
crews stripped of all their property ; all these out­  
rages have been exercised upon innocent and defence*  
h a men, aggravated by unprecedented circurn­  
. ..liices of insult, oppression and baibarity. Some  
ot these violences have been committed on vessels,  
which were captured wi’.hin sight of our harbours ;  
and the great scene of these unparalleled enormities,  
is the island of Cuba, which commands the only ave­  
nue by which we preserve a commercial connexion  
with our in ethrcn of the Western States: a connexion  
whicli wc cherish with ardour, as a source of mutu­  
al advantage, and a bond of permanent union.  
Cut it i» not on account of our pecuniary losses  
alone tint we complain. The constancy and valour  
ot the seamen of the United States, are justly themes  
of patriotic exultation. From their connexion \v;th  
us, vve consider their cause as our cause, their rights  
as our rights, and their interests as our interests:  
our feelings are indignant at the recital of their  
wrongs ; and v. e request, in addition to the protec­  
tion cf a naval force, that, at least in the American  
seas, our brave countrymen may be permitted to  
display their mergv in their own defence.  
Your memorialists conclude w ith remarking, that  
the;, dee,n the present situation of publick affairs to  
be pecuii rly critical and perilous, and such as re­  
quire. ali the prudence, the wisdom, and energy cf  
governmeut, supported by the co-operation of all  
good citizens. Hv mutual exertions, under the be­  
nign influence of Providence, upon this hitherto fa­  
voured nation, we hope the clou,Is which threaten to  
obscure its prosperity, may be dispelled ; and we  
pledge our united support in favour of ail measures  
ad .pted to vindicate and secure the just rights cf our  
I country.

&#x27;K!&#x27;:&#x27;(i 1), imposed nn neutral cmmncce.  
without a.h &lt;|u ile motives and the most  
* ample notice ; presuming especially, that  
commeicbl enterprises, commenced un­  
der tin* sanction oT established principles,  
„ would on no account be affeCtcd by a  
change of system ; your memorialists  
have employed a vast capital in import­  
ing various colonial productions, the sur­  
plus of which, exceeding the demands of  
thfs country, .they have been accustomed  
to export freely to the different markets  
&#x27; Of Europe. *  
, , After this commerce had been prose­  
cuted without restriction for several years, j  
and bad attracted a great proportion of  
their wealth; after their insurers had as­  
sumed immense responsibilities, ground­  
ed on at» opinion, that this trade was  
slriCtly regular; having never received  
the slightest intimation, that it could be  
deemed incompatible with the right* ol a  
bell’gerent nation, they have been sud­  
denly confounded, by unexpected iutelli• j  
go nee of the ar re station on the high seas,  
of a lai ge portion of their properly, which ■  
had been embarked with the most unsus­  
peCtiog confidence.  
The feelings of your memorialists are !  
not only excited, by the losses which they !  
have actually sustained, in consequence  
of a measure unsusceptible of previous  
calculation, but also from the state of un­  
certainty in which they are placed, with  
rc:.pcbt to future commercial operations.  
Your memorialists have heretofore be  
lieved, that commerce between the Unit­  
ed‘States and colonies subject lolhe ene­  
mies of Great Britain, wlien bvnafi.de ptq­  
secuied on tlteir own account, would be  
pe feCtlv safe from interruption : They  
  
nave a so ikiicvcr, mai an unities, which  
might be securely irn/iorted into the Unit  
ed States, might be as securely exported ;  
v/ith the exceptions well understood, both  
’ in respect to the import and export trade,  
of commerce with places blockaded, or in  
articles conn abend of war.­  
In a recent interpretation of what is  
considered bv the tribunals of Great-fit i­  
tain as a direct trade, between the colo­  
‘rues and the parent countries of their e­  
ncmies, your memorialists perceive with  
concern, the developcment of a principle,  
which, if conceded on the part of the U.  
Stages, must prove fatal to their commer-;  
&lt;/al iiiijrortance.  
It is understood to have been decided,  
that, o henever it appears to he the inten­  
tion of the importer of colonial produce,  
to export the same to Europe : or, when­  
ever it is so exported by the ori^in.&#x27;-.l im­  
pel lev, such intention or exportation,  
rdiall be evidvr.ee of a direct trade, and  
tuihjett the property, though neutral, to  
confiscation.  
Your memorialists consider it their  
boutiden duty to themselves and their  
count iy, to express their most decided  
opposition to ibis decision.  
As to the evidence arising from the  
supposed intention of an importer, they  
tefeflily admit, that the greul quantities of  
cranial produce, which are acquired by  
means of the American commerce, ex­  
ceeding the demand for consumption in  
the United Stales, will fairly justify age­  
vmlfirenmfidnn that the suiplus is ulti­  
mately destined for European markets.  
They 3vst-rt, however, that the intention  
of a merchant, in vespeft to th z future des­  
tination of his firofiertj. must, .fioni the  
natuic/of tilings, be inconclusive. All  
plans of business, formed by individuals,  
are liable to be affected by circumstances,  
not to he foreseen or controlled :--these  
p’ans a* e therefore necessarily-re vokable  
by those who form them ; and an intend  
cn which has not bern executed, proves no­  
thing more titan might justly be inferred  
from a general presumption, arising from  
the course cd our commerce. To apply  
such an intention, in a particular case, to  
the prejudice of an individual; to presume  
  
that he has voluntarily incurred an im­  
rtv nse risk, which consistently with the  
success of his main obje ^, he might have  
fairly avoided, and to involve him in ruin,  
for prosecuting a trade, which, if under­  
taken with a different&#x27;motive, would have  
bren declared lawful; would be, in the  
opinion of your memorialists, to confound  
and reverse the best established principles  
of reason, equity and Jaw.  
Y-jUr memorialists contend for no inno­  
vations on th(T law of na&#x27;ions ; and, ex­  
c Jpl where special treaties have prescrib­  
*, ad a different rule, they admit that they  
&#x27;may lawfully be restrained from trans.  
porting the property of the parlies en­  
gaged in war. In the rewsnt decision  
which prohibits an importer from excit­  
ing it to Europe, they however perc eive  
will, concern, cither a nugatory and vex­  
n&#x27;ious regulation, or a meditated blow at  
•*l, u they deem an incontsstible and va­  
luable tight.  
Iferctofoie there existed clear and ob*  
• vinos citcumstances nfdiuciiiniuation, be­  
tween the direct trade, whic h (Ireat llri­  
tain has ass imed the right of denying to  
neutrals, and the indirect »r tircuitom  
■trade, wnich she admits to be lawful. The  
dircel (• ode cc.nld lie performed by a sin.  
gle shipment or voyage ; whereas, the  
circ . ms trade «u&#x27;ijcS$ed tho property to  
rjMtib.u Weight* and insurances, to deduc­  
tions in favor of the revenue, and various  
o&#x27;i’ r expenses in this country.  
If the Kirival nfn 3bipin the rounlry to  
which it belongs; the landing of the car­  
f;o ; the inspeCiion of the custom house;  
the p,v merit or security of duties ; do not  
term.iiate a voyage; then we confc3sourl  
ignorance on a point, which, never huv.  
j.ig been before questioned, has been a-.:  
*• imed liy us as an acknowledged truth, i.  
1. the entry for exportation; the embar-i  
V £  
1 /  
  
kallun «.Tmen.handle* ; the fe inspection  
of the custom house ; the bond for secur- &#x27;  
log a delivery in a foreign country, and a |  
public clearance, do4int indicate the com*  
inencemant of a new voyage, then we are  
yet to learn the meaning oT the expressi­  
on. If all the formalities anil sanctions  
established for the security of our reve­  
nue ; if operations of immense magnitude,  
transacted with the greatest publicity, 5c  
without any motive for concealment, are  
considered as unreal representations, and  
merely colorable Sc fraudulent contrivar*  
ces to cover an illicit trade, between the  
colonies and the parent countries of the  
enemies ol Great Britain ; then it becomes  
necessary, bo.h in regard to our charac­  
ters and interests, to inquire, whether ihe  
new regulations establish a more definite  
criterion for the discovery of truth ?  
We repel with indignation the sugges­  
tion, that trans shipment of property for  
a foreign market, by the original import­  
er, is evidence of fraud or chicane; or  
that, unsupported by other circumstances,  
it can justify a suspicion, that it is other  
than neutral. In our opinion, any di.cri­  
mination between the .rights of an import­  
ing merchant, and a vendee in the United  
Stales, is manifestly fallacious, as it virtu  
ally asserts, that the former can exercise  
only an imperf&#x27;£\ dominion over property  
law hilly acquired, and possessed in this  
countiy, while at the same time he can  
convey to the latter a litic to a p&#x27;vilege  
not enjoyed by himself; in sh ;rt that a  
trade is unlawful, when the advantage is to  
result to one person, but may he render­  
ed lawful, by being participated with an  
Oth r.  
If the new doctrine is executed in the  
mildest fo: in, its operation must be highly  
i injurious, by originating new questions for  
litigation, and of course, subjecting all our  
commerce to new hazards of interruption.  
We presume not, however, to comprehend,  
  
VI Ml WHUl UlUUHtl J lUC \
princ.ple will be applied; we perceive, that  
the ancient land mark has been removed,  
but we seek in vain for a beacon to dtre£\
our course If wc inquire whether a bo­  
| na Ade sale and delivery of merchandise,  
I by an importer, being a citizen, to another  
• known citizen of the United States, for a  
’ valuable consideration, will, as in ordinary  
cases, be conclusive evidence of a transfer  
i of property, 8c the answer is affirmative ;  
i then we cmpla n, that our ships have been  
i detamed, the rales of insurance enhanced,  
I and our property confiscated for the cstab*  
} tneTrt of a rule, which, when once under­  
j stood, will become nugatory, and cease to  
! produce commercial and political effetl.  
I If on ihw other bahd. tlm evidence is not  
| to be deemed conclusive, we profess our*  
selvetobe utterly at a loss to discover,  
i wlnt proofs of ownership, and neutrality  
&#x27;of property can with safety be relied on.  
But these embarrassments, though per­  
- plexing and vexa t us, are not those which  
pi incijraPy. occasion our solicitude We  
aie compelled in consider the late decisions  
cf the British tribunals, as prcl mil, ry  
steps towards a system for controlling the  
importations of colonial productions, arid  
thereby annihilating the most lucrative  
branches of our foreign commerce.  
If we owed this trade solely to the fa­  
vor of (i. Britain ; still we might a«&gt;k, what  
Hi gent motive, w.hat imperious necessity,  
required :l,at the favor should be resumed,  
at a period when our commerce was  
spread over the ocean, and when a change  
so es^eiilial might destroy its sccutily, and  
subject us to incalculable losses?  
deny, however, that the lights of  
commerce as claimed by us, are to be  
| deemed favors ; on the contrary, if the law  
1 of na ions is other than a temporary rule,  
j prescribed by an arbitrary will and enforc*  
i ed by power, then we appeal to its most  
j universal and inviolable principle, in our  
• defence. This principle is, that the goods  
0/ a neutral, consisting of articles not contra.  
band of war in a neutral vessel, eni/iloyed in  
a direct trade, between neutral countries, and  
&#x27; hor.&#x27;S of a brlli&#x27;rrrent eoritifrn tint inn  
  
; or blo&lt; Jbaa&#x27;erfy are [irotectcd,  
| In the controversies which have exist­  
j ed at different times, for extending the  
j privileges of neutral vessels, and limit­  
•ting the grounds to capture, we take no  
i part } we appeal to the old law. If neu*  
Ural rights can be reduced within more  
! confined limits than this law prescribes,  
we percieve not how, amidst the collisi­  
ons of national interests, any neutral com­  
merce can exist, even in our native pro­  
ductions.  
If it be intimated, that neutrats should  
be confined to a commerce with such  
places, and in such articles only, as were  
allowed in peace, by the municipal regu­  
lations of the count-ies engaged in war ;  
the doctrine may be repelled by the no­  
torious fact, that no such principle has  
governed the conduct of nations, during  
I any wars in which they have been en­  
! gaged ; ail were free to vary, and all in  
Ia6t have varied, their commercial sys­  
tems : whatever theoretical opinions may  
therefore have been advanced, there has  
existed no such practic il rule, 8c to set up  
such a rule, under the unparalleled cir­  
cumstances of the present war, must in*  
fahbly destroy the commerce ol this coun­  
try.  
It is a well known fa6t, that the people  
of the United Stares export to foreign  
countries a greater proportion of the ag­  
gregate annual value of the products of  
their industry, than any other people of  
the globe ; they are consequently most  
deeply interested in the security and free­  
dom of their trade : in short, being al­  
most exclusively jn agricultural and com­  
mercial people, those parts of our coun­  
try, which, from recent settlement  
ar Irom other circumstances* a-3 whol­  
y a^jr.cul’.ural, are moi*i immediate­  
  
Jy interested than any othe», as they are  
in a greater degree dependant on foreign  
s»s -olies, awl consequently most liable to  
be affected, by any vibrations of the com­  
mercial sysiem.  
Asour uictnufadVjres do not flourish in :  
proportion to the progress of our papula- |  
tinn, wealth and luxury, the necessity ofj  
extending our commerce is Constantly  
increasing.  
The basis of all our trade is the ng- I  
gregate value of our native productions, j  
exceeding what are consumed in the U­  
nited States : these are exported to vari­  
ous countries, from which we receive sup­  
plies for domestic use, or other articles  
for exportation. A very great proporti­  
on of all the results of our commerce  
wi;h the world, centre in the dominions  
of Great Britain, and we receive almost  
exclusively from that country, our clo­  
thing and other necessary manufactures.  
By the events of the late Sc present war,  
many countries with Which we prosecu­  
ted an increasing trade, have been either  
diverted from (nanufufluiing pursuits, or  
conquered and subject to the colonial  
system of Great Britain.  
With these pivliniinary fadts in view,  
we request permission to detail some of  
the most important consequences of the  
assumed rule, that neutrals may bs restrain­  
ed in time of wart to their accustomed trade i  
in time oj peace. The injustice of such a  
rule, in relation to the United Slates,  
wiil be move manifest : the individuals  
employed in commerce, would not alone  
be affected s all the internal relations of.  
cur country would be disturbed : the in- 1  
terests of thos* district* wh eti are iuo%t |  
remote from our principal ports, would ;  
in proportion to their dependence on fo­  
reign supplies, be moat severely depress­  
ed.  
The effedts of war cannot be confined  
to the countries engaged in war. The  
value of money; the pries of labor : the  
_f r » .  
  
uwiguv nuu insurance, ure oy war  
enhanced throtigout the world ; all arti­  
cles of merchandize, both of Export and  
impoat, ore variously affected, in their  
qualities and value, by new.wants; by  
relinquishment of tornier pursuits, and  
by the new dire£lion which is thereby  
given to the it dustiy of different nations.  
Other consequences result from the ef­  
fe6\s of war ; as the impoverishment of  
some, and the aggrandizement of other  
countries : also, from the acknowledged  
nglr of belligerent nations to interdi£\
commerce in contraband articles, and to  
institute blockades. Thislastrighi is high­  
ly injurious to neutrals, as it frequently  
restrains them from proceeding to the  
b* st maikeis. It is obviously impossible  
therefore, to confine the United States,  
in time of war, amidst ail these changes  
and disadvantages, to their accustomed  
trade in time oj fieace, without destroying  
all irttde.  
If, ia consequence of th« war, certain  
articles usually exported from the Uni­  
ted States 10 countries from which we  
received necessary supplies, cease to be  
demanded in tho.se countries, may we  
not export other articles, and thereby ob­  
tain the supplies we need ?  
If articles usually imported into the  
United States in time of peace, ceaje to  
be demanded by us in time of war, in  
consequence ol our ability to obtain substi­  
tutes which we prefer, shall we be requi­  
red to renounce our export trade, by be­  
ing forbid to import other articles for  
consumption or for commerce ? or shall  
we be compelled to receive in exchange,  
articles which we do not require ?  
If, in consequence of an increased de­  
mand for our exports to particular coun­  
; tries, we obtain in exchange, articles of  
i commerce exceeding our domestic wants,  
, shall it bo required that the surplus pe­  
| rish on our hands ?  
If Great Britain permits commerce be­  
tween her *ubjecU and the colonies of her  
  
n&lt;iii me cunscui  
of tho.e colonies, participate in the same  
j commerce ?  
I If our commerce with the enemies of  
j Great Britain may new be confined to  
I the system established in lime of peace,  
may we not apprehend that the principle  
will be retaliated, in r.-peel to our com  
raerce with the colonies of Great Britain ?  
in that case, what can ensue but war,  
i pillage, and devastation ?  
These are not imaginary suppositions :  
they illustrate the most imporlant princi­  
ples of our commerce : they evince the  
necessity of a circuitous trade, to enable.1  
us to realise the great value of exports in  
our native productions, by which alone we  
acquire the power to liquidate the bal­  
ance against us, in our commerce with  
Great Britain: they demonstrate, that  
the position against which we contend, is  
not a rule of the law of nations : the law  
of nations ordains no rule which is une­  
qual and unjust.  
Rut still wc have other and more forcible ob­  
jrfiions j the concession which is required, would  
deprive us of many advantages, connected with  
our local situation, our enterprise, our wealth,  
and our fortune \ it would require us to divert  
much of our capital and industry to new employ­  
ments j it would amount to an abandonment of  
views, as a commercial people, and might involve  
us in dangerous controversies, by virtual admis­  
sion, that any essential articles of supply may,  
at the pk-acure of a belligerent nation, be placed  
in a state of inhibition, equivalent to being de­  
clared contraband of wa*.  
1 liti-crto we have regarded it as a peculiar fe­  
licity incident to oufr neutral situation, that it j  
was equally beneficial to ourselves, aid to all the !  
parties wi.h whom we are connected : the arti- j  
rles exjrorted by us to the enemies of Great |  
Britain, being convenient supplies* promised to I  
secure to our ships in their ports a welcome re­  
ception and Iro&#x27;pitable treatment. As the direft  
rerums for these exposts were inconsiderable,  
t&quot;d as the nroduiis were almo-t exclusively re  
mitted to Great Britain, and thereby applied in  
payment for mauafaflnrcs purchased 9a our ac­  
  
rotinii we cor.S&#x27;t!ered ourselves sure 6f receiving  
i.ort lheni, at least, that decree of protei^on*.  
which was recommended by a regard to mutual  
mteies.:s  
It is however with much surprize that we  
have receni y discovered, that the very circum­  
stances upon which our hopes of security were  
reposed, have been urged as arguments to justify  
ani invasion of our right,. a,.d that, having to  
ta.ly suppressed the external commerce of her  
enemies, Great Britain is now councelled to ap­  
propriate to herself that of her friends. If it L  
*’ S!t CXp0r(U‘H of crrta,n articles to the  
ul mate markets, our interests are in collision  
with hers s yet it ought to be reconciled. that it  
is a particular and minor interest only which  
sutlers, and that the disadvantage is a necessary  
consequence of colonial system : that the  
general result of our commerce are great­  
ly in her favor s that they invu^rate  
her manufaiiuring interests, which are the  
great basis of her wealth ; and that these  
Carnv.neTer ** Promoied by the impove­  
njiment of her best customers. Surely the se­  
curity of neutral rights ought net to dimmish, as  
their value is augmented : surely a maritime pre­  
ponderancy, wh.ch enab&#x27;es its possessor to bloc­  
kade any of the ports of its enemies conveys no  
just title to a monopoly *f the commerce of the  
wond 1  
In the list of our complains, w. cannot for­  
bear to enumerate the humiliating and oppres.  
s. ve conduit of ships of war, in tlie vicinity of  
our coasts and harbors. We respelt the princi­  
ple, and emulate the conduit of Crest Britain  
in regard to her own jurisdidtion and we wish  
merely to claim for ourselvea the same measure  
of justice which she exafts from others.  
But while we contend that we ought not to be  
exposed to humiliating inquisitions in the verge  
of our port , which by means of secret connexions  
with our city, may be rendered conduc.ve to the  
indulgence of-partiality, favor, or malice, we dis­  
avow every wish to divest the bclligersnt nati­  
ons of their rights. Ifv in particular instances,  
t. ie American liig. and the chafer of an Arne  
ncan merchant, have been prostituted to unwor  
thy purpose*, we declare the individuals thus  
guilty to b* cur enemie.,. and we wish not to  
screen them from the just consequences of their  
rrns.ondua. We also assert, that a comprehen  
sive view of our commerce, affords conclusive&#x27;  
evidence, tha&#x27; of he proportion which can pos­  
fiioly belong to the enemies of Great Britain, is  
an obica unwonhv the attention nfn  
  
erf especially, if in a rigorous pursuit of its  
»trril rights, it incurs the hazard of forfeiting  
the esteemufits friends.  
If, therefore the mode in which the American  
commerce is prosecuted, is allowed by the lair  
of nations j &gt;f irrefragable evi fence arises from  
our situation, wants, and necessary connexions  
with the rest of the world, that it is almost ex­  
clusively .grounded cn American capital; if the  
suggestions, tha*. we are the mere agent* ot fo­  
reigners, are ungenerous insults, contrived as a  
pologies for injuries : if frauds in relation to  
foreign trusts, ate not more frequent in this  
country thau In Great Britain; and if no go­  
vernment is able wholly to prevent them : then  
our conclusion in the present, as in all other ca.  
ses. ought to be deduced from gcniral fafls, and  
notjrroin particular exceptions This conclusion  
is, that the American commerce is one of the  
great links which connea those interests of.ci­  
\ ilised nations, which wars ought not to disturb:  
that to break this link, will h« to destroy all  
commerce; and therefore, ihat a serious misun­  
dcretading with Great Britain would prove fatal  
to the most important interests of both countries.  
This view of the subjuft, while it excites our  
anxiety, furnishes also a resource for our hopes.  
Wc wish only for justice, and beliving that a*  
commercial nation which disregards justice, there­  
by undermines the citadel of her power, we re­  
ly on the effect of mutual interests and wishes in  
prompting a cordial explanation, and fair adjust­  
ment of every cuuoe of misunderstanding i in  
particular, we rely on the government of ottr  
country,that our rights will not be abandoned,  
and that no argument in favor of an usurpation,  
will ever be derived from our acquiescence.  
If our personal interests and local attachments  
have not greatly misdirected our opinions, the  
defenceless situation of the- port of New York,  
ought to excite the anxious soiicitndeof every  
friend of his country. Our river is the commer­  
cial avenue to a fertile and populous country,  
which is rapidly rising into importance It is  
here, that one third of the revenue of the Union  
is collected ; and this proportion is understood  
to be relatively increasing But while we are  
grateful for these distinguished advantages of na­  
1 ture, our satisfaction ii diminished, by reHeiling  
j on their security ; for in proportion as the re­  
t sources of the country accumulate to this point,  
j *■ haz*rd, that they may present a temptati­  
on to rapacity, and become the prize of violence  
Without recurring to the experience of past  
times for proofs that no nation can long main-&#x27;  
tain an extensive commerce, witheut well de  
J fended sea ports, and an efficient military marine,  
we are admonished by the new and portentous  
asoe&amp;of cur )De. and the *1 *irm»n^ iirruaUnm oC I  
  
j piracy in the We3t-Indies, that energetic mra- I  
sures of defence have become indispensibly nc- !  
• cessary.  
We presume not to express any opinion res­  
pecting the degree of force, of which the perm*,  
nent navy ought to consist 5 and being sensible  
that delays must attend the construction of suit­  
able defences for our port, we shall rest satisfied,  
when we perceive that these measures are com  
menced tn a manner, and upon a sca&#x27;e, which will  
assure to us an efficient completion.  
Such however, is the present organized force  
of the U. States, that we should con-ider it in­  
consistent with the honor, interests, or security  
of our country, to parley with the pirates of the  
West Indies, whose conduit being inconsistent  
with any known rules of lawful warfare cannot  
have been authorised by any civilized nation to.  
wards another nation in a state of peace. Our  
vessels, while pursuing a lawful trade, have been  
piratically seized, their cargoes have been forci.  
bly taken away, and distributed, without even  
the form of a trial i the vessels in many instances  
funk and destroyed, and the crews stripped of all  
their property ; all these outrages have been ex­  
crcised upm innocent and defenceless men, ag.  
gravated by unprecedented circumstances of in  
suit, oppression and barbarity. Some of those  
violences have been committed on vessels which  
were captured within sight of our harbours 1 and  
the great scene of these, unparalleled enormities,  
is the island of Cuba, which commands the only  
avenue by which we preserve a commercial con­  
nexion with our brethren of the western states:  
a connexion which we cherish wi’h ardor, as a  
source of muitial advantage, and a bond of per.  
manent union  
Hut it is not on account of our pecuniary loss­  
es alone that we complain. The constancy and  
va&#x27;or of the seamen ol the United States, are  
justly themes of patriotic exultation From their  
connexion with us. we consider their cause as  
our cause, their rights as our rights, ami their in­  
terests as out interests 1 onr feelings are indig.  
nan* at the recital of their wrongs; u we reaiicst,  
in addition to the protection of n naval force, that  
at least in the American seas, our brave country^  
men miy oe permitted to display their energy in  
their own defence.  
Your memorialists conclude with remarking,  
that th-y deem th« present situation of public at*  
  
Fairs to be peculiarly critical anj perlloox, an l  
»uch as require* all the prudence, the w lad am,  
and e-tergy of Government, supported bv t^e c&gt;*  
operation of all good citizens. By mutual exer­  
tion3, under the benign influence of Providence,  
upon this hitherto favored nation, wc hope the  
clouds that threaten to obscure its prosperity,  
may be dispelled; and we pledge our united sup­  
port iu favor of all measures adopted revindicate  
and secure the just rights of our country  
And your memorialists as iu tlety bound,  
will ever pray, fcc.  
Signed by the unanimous order, *nd on behalf

State*»f America, in Congrel* aficmbled. The  
Memorial of tire Merchants of tire city of AVoc  
rwi.  
Yoea Memoria&#x27;lfls beg leave refpe«Sful!r to ap­  
proach the government of then- country, on i&#x27;uhje&amp;s  
of gnat importance, which have aft&#x27;cdlcd their minds  
with the decpcfl anxiety end alarm.  
Confiding in th* joitice and friendly difpofition* of  
the government of Great Britain and entertaining a  
correfpoudent expectation that no unufual rcUri&amp;ious  
.would be impofed on Neutral Commerce, without  
adequate motives and the molt ample notice; pre­  
fuming efpecially, that commercial enterprises, com­  
menced under the fun&amp;ion of efluUIifncd prior, &#x27;pits,  
would on no account he afiedled by a change of l&#x27;yf­  
tein ; your memorialifis have employed a vail capi­  
tal in importing various colonial pi oJutfiona, the  
Turpins of which, exceeding the demands of this coun­  
try, they have been accudomed to export freely to  
the different markets of Europe.  
After this commerce had been profecuted without  
reftrldtion forfeveral years, and had attra&amp;c 1 a great  
proportion of their wealth ; after their iufurers had  
aUi&#x27;oed inunenf&#x27;e refponfibilities grounded on ana­  
pinion tiiat this trade was flriclly regular ; having ne­  
ver received the dightufl intimation, that it could be  
deemed incompatible with the rights of a Imlligercnt  
nation, they have been fuddcnly confounded, by un­  
expected intelligence of the arreflation on the high  
fees, of a large portiou of their property which  
had been embarked w ith the moll unfufpetting confi­  
dence.  
&#x27;I ke feelings of your memorialifis are nor only ex­  
cited hy the Ioffe* which they have actually fullaincd,  
in confeq&#x27;ience of a meafure unfufceptiblenf previous  
calculation, but alfo from the Hate of uncertainty in  
which they are placed, with refpt&lt;2 to future com­  
mercial operations.  
Your roemoria&#x27;ifls have heretofore hcli&#x27;-ved that  
commerce between the U. State* and colonies fubjeCl  
to the enemies of Oreat-Britain, when Lenaf.de pro­  
fecuted on their own account, would be perfectly  
fafe from interruption : They have alfo believed, that  
all articles, which might he fecurely imported into the  
United Sta&#x27;es, might be as fecurely exported; with  
the exceptions well underflood, both in refpeA to  
the import and export trade of commerce with pla­  
ce* blockaded, or in articles contraband of war.  
In a recent interpretation of what is confidered by  
the tribunals of Great Britain as a diredl trade, be­  
tween the colonies and the pirent countries of their  
enemies, your memorialifis perceive with concern,  
the developetm-nr of a principle, which, if conceded  
on the part of ch*- U t&#x27;ted Stans, nm.t prove fatal to  
th.-ir commercial importance.  
It i* undentood to have been decided, that when­  
ever it appears to be the intention of the importer of  
colonial produce, to export the fame to Europe ; or,  
whenever it is fo exported by the original importer,  
fuch intention or exportation, (hall he evidence of a  
direO tra.le, and fuhjeit the property, though neutral,  
to confirmation.  
Ye.it memorialifis confiderit their bounded duty  
fo thentfelves and their country, to exprefs their mofl  
decided oppnfirion to this decifion.  
As to the evidence arifing from the fuppofed inten­  
tion of an importer, they read&#x27;ly admit, that the  
great quantities of colonial produce, which are ac­  
quired by means of the American commerce, exceed­  
ing the demand for confumotinn in the United States,  
fairly juflify a nener.il prrfurr.pt.,n, that the (urplus is  
ultimately deflined for European marheti&gt;. They af­  
fert, Irowcver, that thv intemtien of a merchant, in  
relpedl ro the future definition of bis ptoperty, mull,  
from the nature of thing, hr incondufive. AlJ plans  
i&#x27;i btifinefi,formed by individuals, are liable to be af­  
fedied hy circtunllr.uces, not to be forefeen or con­  
trolled : the&#x27;e plans are tliercfore necHTarily revoke­  
hie by thole who form them ; and an Intention which  
h&quot;ia hot L.en ixecut.d, proves nothing more than might  
jvfUy be inferred from a general prefomptinn, ariling  
I to w the courfe of our commerce, To apply Inch  
■ t inr. ution, in a particular cafe, to the prejudice of  
;«n individual ; tnprefvime that he has voluntarily in­  
■t irrrd vi immenfe rifle, which, confidently with the  
J.ceds of his main obji-CI, he might have fairiy a-I  
voided, and ;o involve him in ruin for profecuting p  
rrode, which, ifnndmaken with a different motive,  
would leave been declared lawful; would he, in the  
cbpbiion of your memorialifis, to confound and re­  
verie the bed eflabliited principles of rpafop, equity  
and law.  
Your momorulifts contend for no innovations on  
tha law of nation* ; and, exc.pt where fpecial trea­  
ties hav* pr-ftribed a different rule, they admit that  
they may lawfully be retrained from tranfporting the  
property of the parties engaged in war. In the recent  
dicifion which prohibit* an importer of colonial pro­  
d ice from exporting it to Europe, they however per­  
ceive With concern, either a nugatory and vexatious  
regulation, ora meditated blow, at vv/iat they deem  
ap ncnmeflitie and valuable right.  
i If .&#x27;erofore there exiflei clear and obvious circum­  
ftunce* of d:fcr. nination, between the diredt trade,  
which Ore-.t Britain ha? affirmed the right of deny­  
ing to neutral?, and the indirect w» circuitous trade,  
winch Ike Idm&#x27;ts to be lawful. The dirtdl trade  
could he p -rform-d by a fingle (bipment or voyage ;  
whereas, the circhitons trade fubjedled the property  
to JoaWe freights and infnrances, to dedudlions in  
favovrc./tl.e reyenye, ar.d various other expence*  
  
in r.is country.  
It the arrival of a {hip i:i the country to which it  
belongs; the landing of the cargo ; the itifpcdtion of  
the Cilftom-Houfo ; iha payment or fecurity of du­  
ti-s; do not terminate a voyage; then we confab our  
ignorance on a point, which, never having been be­  
fore queftiened, lyu Veen a (Turned hy us as an acknow­  
ledged truth. (f the entry for exporfiwjon ; the cm­  
birkation of rasrrhandigtf; the re-.’iifpcdlioti of the  
Cmfom Hoitfe ; the bond for focuring a delivery in a

our revenue ; if operations of immenfc magnitude,  
tranfa&amp;e 1 with the gr**af.eft publicity, and without

inftirance enhanced, and our property confifcated,for  
the eihblilhnitnt of a rule, which, when once uuder­  
tlnod, will become nugatory, and ceafe to produce any  
commercial or political e-ffe£t. If on the other hand,  
thisevidence is not to be deemed conclufive, wepro­  
fefi ourfelves to be utterly at a Infs to difeover, what  
proofs of owtierlhip,and neutrality of property, can  
with fafety be relied on.  
But thtffe embarraffments, though perplexing and  
vexatious, are not thole which principally occafion  
our Inlicitude. We are compelled to confnler the  
late decifions of the Britiih tribunals, as preliminary  
| (teps towards a fyfiein for controling tlie importations  
and exportations of colonial productions, and thereby  
annihilating the mod lacrativo branches of our fo­  
reign commerce.  
If we owed this trade folely to the favcnir of Great  
Britain; (till we might a lit, what urgent motive,  
what imperious neceflity, required that the favour  
fhould Iw re fumed, at a period when our commerce  
was fpread over the ocean, and when a change fo  
effetitial might dvflroy its fecurity, and fubjoCl us to  
incalculable Ioffes l  
We deny, however, that the rights of commerce,  
as claimed by u«, are to he deemed favours; en the  
contrary, if the law of nations is other than a tempo­  
rary rule, preferibed by an arbitrary will,and enforc­  
ed by power, then we appeal to its moll univerfal and  
inviolable principle, in our defence. This principle  
is, that tie Clrcds of a Keutra&#x27;., confining cf articles not  
Contraband of tour, in a neutral nrcjTtl, employed in m di­  
retl trad, bets keen neutral count riel, and ports of a belli­  
gerent country not in-v-fled or blockaded,art protected.  
hi the coutruverftes which have etilled at different  
times, for extending the privileges of neutral veflels,  
and limiting the grounds of capture, we take no part:  
we appeal to the old law. If neutral rights can be  
redacted within more confined limits than this law  
nreferibes, we perceive not how, amislil the coliilions  
ol national iuterefis, any neutral commerce can exift,  
even in our native productions.  
If it be intimated, that neutrals fhould he confined  
to a commerce with fuch places,and in fuch articles  
only as were allowed in peace, by the municipal re­  
gulations of the countries engaged in war ; tlie doc­  
trine may he repelled by the notorious fadl, that no  
fuch principle has governed the condud of nations,  
during any wars in which they have been engaged;  
all were free to vary, and in fadl all have varied,  
their commercial fyftems: whatever theoretical opi­  
nions may therefore have been advanced, there has  
ex&#x27;fted no fuch pradical rule, and to fet up fuch a rule,  
under the unparralleled circumfiances of the preftnt!  
war mull infallibly dtflrcy the commerce of this coun­  
f*7- .  
It is a well known find, that the people of the U- ]  
:iited States export to foreign countries a greater pro- j  
portion of the aggregate annual value of the produdls  
of their induftry, than any other people of tlie globe;  
they are confeqncntly mofk deeply interfiled in the  
fc-curity and freedom of their trade : in ftiort, being  
alinofl exclufively an agricultural and commercial  
people thofe parts of our country, which, from re­  
cent (ettlenient, or from other circumftauces, are  
wholly agricultural, are more immediately in tere (led  
than any other, as they are in a greater degree depen­  
dent on foreign fupplies, and confequently moll liable  
to be affedti-d, byany vibrations of the commercial lyf­  
tem.  
As our manufa&amp;ures do not flourifh in proportion  
to the progref* of our population, wealth, aud luxury,  
the neceflity of extending our commerce is couflanrly  
iucreafing.  
T he haCsof all our trade is the aggregate value ef  
, our native productions, exceeding what are confiiined  
j in the Uuitc-d States : there arc exported to various  
countries, from which we receive fupplies for domef­  
tic ufe, or other articles for exportation. A very  
great proportion of all the refults of «ur commerce  
with the world centre it; {he dominions af Great-Bci­  
tsda, and we receive almoik exclufivelv from that coun­  
try, our cloathing.mid other neceflary manufa&amp;ures.  
Uy tlie events of the late and prefent war, many  
countries with which we profeented an in.reafmg 1  
trade, have been either diverted from manufacturing j  
purfuits, or have been greatly impoverifhed. or con­  
quered and fubjedt?d to the colonial fyliem uf Great- j  
Britain.  
With thefe preliminary fails in view, w» requefl 1  
permifliori to detail fome of the moll important con-&#x27;  
(tquencesof the ufliimed rule, that neutrals maw be re&#x27;- i  
trained, in time of war, to their accuJlonseJ trade in tints |  
of peace. The injuflice of fuch a rule, in relation i« j  
the United States, will be more manifeft: the indi- 1  
viduals employed in commerce, would not alone he !  
afledcd : a!! the internal relations of our country .  
would be dillurbed: the iuterefis of thofe iliflrids &#x27;  
which are mofl remote from our principal ports, i  
w.-iuld,in proportion to thtir dependence on foreign I  
fupplies, be moll feverely depreffed.  
The effeiSs of war cannot be confined to the couu* !  
tries engaged in war. The value of money; rhe 1  
price of labour ; the rates of fright and infurance,!  
are by war enhanced throughout the world ; nil ar­  
ticles of merchandize, both of export and import, arp  
variojfly affefitd,in their quantities and value, by  
new wants; by the relinquilhment of former purfubs, j  
and by the new direction which is thereby given to &#x27;  
the induftry of differ. :t nations.—Other confer i.-.kc?  
re full from the effects of war; as the impoverish..it  
of fome, stid the aggrandizement of other countries :  
alfo, from the acknowledged right of belligerent 1,411*  
oils to i&#x27;nturdidl commerce in contraband artick-s, and  
to inftitute blockades. This lad right is highly inju­  
rious to neutral*.asi: frequently reftraius them from  
proceeding io tiie hell markets. It is ojivioufly im­  
pofljble, therefore, to confine the United State-*, ip  
time of war, amid ft all th*fe charge* and difa-Jvueta­  
ges, to their accullomed trjile in time of pe^ce, with­  
out deflroying all trade.  
  
If, in confequence of the war, certain articles ufu­  
ally exported from the United that?* to countries from  
which we received iKCcflary fupplies, ceafe to be de­  
manded in thofe countries, may we not export fitter  
•articles, a&#x27;u} thereby obtain the fupplies we need ?  
If articles ufually imported into the United States  
in time of peace, ceafe to be demanded by us ill time  
of war, in confeq’jence of our ability to obtain fub­  
Ititfcte* when we prefer fhall we he required to re­  
nounce our export trade, by being forbid to import  
other articles for confumption or for commerce ? or  
rtiall » ( be compelled to receive in exchange, articles  
which we do not require }  
If, in confequence of an increafed demand far our  
exports to particular countries, we obtain in exchange,  
articles of commerce exceeding our do.ntdlic wants,  
lhall it be required that (he furplus peril), on our  
hands *  
If fJreat-Britain permit? commerce between her  
fubjedl and the colonies of her enemies,may we not,  
with the ednfent of thofe colonies, participate in th&lt;:  
lame commerce i  
If our commerce with the enemies ef Great-Bri­  
idL* may no# be coulined to the fyll**m eftabliltied in  
j time of peace, may we not apprehend that thu prin­  
ciple will retaliated, in refpe# to our commerce  
| with the colonist of Great Britain ? In that talc, what  
can enfue but war, pillage,and devaluation &gt;  
Thrfe arc not imaginary fuppofitiotis ; they illuf­  
trate the moft important principles of our commerce;  
they evince thf neceflity of a circuitous tradr, to en­  
able us to realise the great value qf exports in our  
native Jirodudlium, by which alone we Acquire the

itato the enemies of Gr-at-li.itain, being i &gt;uvenient  
iupplies—promifed to fecure to our (hip® in their

A* the direct return* f.»r cliei&#x27;c exports were incoofi­  
derable.aad a* the produ#* wtht alni»it exclufively  
renutted to Great-llnta.ti, and thereby applied in  
payment for nianufaCiuie* purchaCrd on our account,  
we confitlered ourfelve* lure of receiving from them,  
at leaft that degree of protection, which was rccom­  
mended by a regard to mutual inturells.  
It is however with much furprilis that we have re­  
cently difcovvied, tiiut the very circontftatices upon  
which our hopes of fecurity are reppfed, have been  
urged a* arguments to jgftify an invafion of our right®,  
and that, having totally Itpprefled the external com­  
merce of her enemies, Great-Britain is now couufel  
led to appropriate to lierfeil that of her friends. If it  
be true that, as exporters of certain aritles to the ul­  
timate markets, our iuterefts are in coilifu.n with her*  
—yet it ought to berecoPedcd.that it i» a particular  
ami minor mtcreft only which fufters, and that rhe tiif­  
advaiitagc is a uuctrfTary coidefluence of her colonial  
fyilem : that the get:, ral rr Cults of our commerce are  
greatly in her favor : that they invigorate her manu­  
facturing imerells, which arc the great b*lu of her  
wealth ; and that thefe ii&#x27;.terefts can never be promot­  
ed by the rmpsveriOiment of her hyil culUaners.  
Surely the fecurity of neutral rights ought not to Ji­  
miniih, asthoir value is au^atenteJ : (urely a mari­  
time preponderance, which enables its p»fle(Tor to  
blockade any of the purl® of it® enemies, conveys no  
juft title to 4 monopoly ol the commerce of the  
world !  
In the lids of our oontplsh&#x27;ts, we canon: forbear to  
enumerate the humiliating aud otipreilive couJuCl of  
Chips of war, in the vicinity of our c®atl? and har­  
bour*. We refpect the principle- and emulate the  
couduX of Great-Britain,in regard to om-o«vti junf­  
diXiou, and we nidi merely to claim for ourlelve®  
the fame imafure of juft ice which die exact® from o­  
thers.  
But while we contend that we ought not to he ex­  
poled to humiliating iuqoifitiotis in the verge of our  
port, which by means of fecret connexions with our  
city, may lie rendered conducive to the indulgence  
of partiality, favor or malice, we difavbw every wi!h  
to diveft the belligerent nations of their right®- If,  
in particular inftaners, the American tl ig, and the  
character of an American merchant, have been prof  
tituted to unworthy piirpofes, we declare the indi­  
viduals thus guilty, to be our enemies, and we wiih  
not tofsreen them from the juft conferences of their  
mifeonduvrt. We alfo aft-rt, that a comprehcnfive  
view *f our commerce affords conclusive evidence  
that of the property circulated through this port, the  
proportion which can pofiihly belong to the enemies  
of Great Britain, is an obje# unworthy the attention  
of a great power ; efpecially, if in 4 rigorous pur­  
fuit of its ftri# rights, it incurs tliss hazard uf for­  
feiting rhe erteem of its friends.  
11, therefore, the mode in which the American  
commerce is profecuted, is allowed by the law of na­  
tions ; if irrefragable evidence arifea from our (jura­  
tion, wants. and ncceflary connexions with the rcil  
of the world, that it is almort exrlufivclv grounded  
on American capital | if the fugged ions, that we are  
die mete -agentsof foreigners, are ungenerous infults  
contrived as apologies fop injuries ; if frauds in rela­  
tion to foreign trail®, are not more frequent in this  
country than in Great Britain ; and if no government  
is able wholly to prevent rhc-in : then our condufiou  
in th*&gt; prefent, as in all other cafes, ought to be de­  
duced from general fails, atid not from particular ex­  
ception*. This concluflon is. thst the American com­  
merce is one of the great links which conn-# thole  
iuterefU of civilized nations, which war* ought not  
to dillurb; that to break this link, will be to d&lt;-flroy  
all commerce; and therefore, that a feriogs mifunder­  
ftanding with Great Britain would pro ve fatal to the  
ttjort important intereft* of both countries.  
This view of the fubjedt, while it excites our an­  
xiety, furniffies, alfo urefource lor «ur hope*. We  
wiih only for jiiftice : and believing that a commer­  
cial nation which difregards juitice, thereby under­  
mines the citadel of her power, We rely on the effed  
of mutual interefls and wift)p* in promoting a cordial  
explanation, and fair adjuflmei.t of every caufe of  
mifmiderfhnding : in particular, v/c rely on tha go­  
vernment of our country, that opr r.ghts will not he  
abandoned, and that no argument in favour of an u­  
lurpition will ever bp derived from uur atquiefctsnce.  
If ourperfonal imstrft* and local attachments have  
not gr-atly ims-direXrd our opinions, the liifcncelefs  
filiation of rhe purr of New-Yoik, ought to exc;tf  
the anxious folichude of every frienj of his country.  
Opr river is the only cnnir.iercinl avenue to a fertile  
an l popuiou* country, which is rapidly riling into  
importance. It is here, that a.ir ibirj of the revenue  
of the Union is coiledled ; an.! tliis proportion is un­  
derilood to he relatively increafing. But while we  
ere grateful for thefe diftinguirtu-d advantages of na­  
ture. our fatisfadlion is diunnChed, hy relieving 0:1  
their iniecurity * for in prsportian as the refources of  
our country ac urnulat.- to tliis point is the hazard,  
that they may prefent a temptation to rapacity, and  
become the priz- of violence. Without recurring to  
the experience of part times f.rr proofs, that no nation  
can long maim-.i;: an ticerTivc commerce, Without  
wall defended fc.-ports, and an efficient military ma­  
rine, we are admonirtied by tne new and portentous  
■fpe# of Europe, apd th.- alarming j.reyiience of pi­  
racy in the Weft-Indies, that energetic .i.eafurts of  
defence have become ind&#x27;fjpenfahly neceft.it y.  
We prefirne not to exprefi any q pin ion refpe#ing  
the degree of force, pf which the permanent navy  
ought to confirt ; and being fenfibiu that delavs mufl  
attepd the conllruXinn of bistable defences f«r *ur

thefe mealnre* are commenced in a manner, and upon  
a fcale, whiph will ajlbre to us an efficient comple­  
tion.  
  
Such however, is the prefrnt organized force of the  
United States, that we fhauld consider it inconfiflcnt  
vri*,h the honor, interefts, or fecority of our coantry,  
to parley with the pirate* of the Wed Indies, whofc  
conduift lieing incur,iident with any known rules of  
lawful warfare, cannot have been authorized by any  
civilized nation towards another nation, in a ftateof

have been piratically fe aed, their cargoes have been  
forcibly taken away and diftribute d, without even the  
form of atriqj; the voflels in many inlWces funk A

ed on an opinion that his  
lar; hav

unsuspecting confidence.  
The feelings of your memorialists are not only ex-  
  
_ cited by the losses they have actually sustained, in  
- consequence  
  
ven &amp;% measure unsusceptible of previous  
calculation, butalso from the state of uncertainty in  
whieh they are placed, with respect to future com-  
‘mercial operations. —  
  
Your memorialisis have heretofore believed that  
commerce between the United States and colonies  
subject to the enemies of Great-Britain, when bona  
  
i pooh St apo on their own account, would be per-  
fectly safe from interru &#x27; i“  
  
ption: They have also be-  
lieved, that all articles, which might be securely im-  
ported into the United States, might be as securely  
exported; -with the exceptions well understood, both  
m respect to the importand export trade of com-  
merce with places blockaded, or in articles contra-  
baud of war.  
  
In a recent interpretation of what is considered  
  
by the tribunals of Gréar-Britain as a direct trade, .  
  
between the colonies and the parent countries of  
heirenemies, your metnorialists perceive with con-  
cern, the i ar of a principle. which if con-  
  
cedédion theypatt of the United Staves; mus: prove  
fatal to ne mmercial imporiance. _ r  
This undérst6od to have been decided, that when-  
  
ever it appears to be the intention of the importer of  
  
_ colonial prodgce, toexport the same to Europe : or  
‘whenever it is so exported by the original impor:er,  
  
yr de aoepa or sey capt shall be evidence of a  
ct trade, subject the property, though neurral  
  
to confiscation. ) ein :  
  
Your memorialists consider it their bounden duty  
to themselves and their country, to express their  
most poy «rape to this decision.  
  
As to the nce arising from the supposed in-  
tention of an imporser, they readily admit, that the  
reat quantines of colonial produce, which are ac-  
quired by means ot the American commerce, ex-  
ceeding the demand for consumption in the United  
States, will fairly justify a general presumption, that  
the sui is hima ely destined for European mar-

uals,are liable to be affected by circumstances motto  
be foreseen or controlled ;—these pians are therefore  
necessarily revokable by those who form them ; &amp; an  
intention which has not been executed, proves nothing  
more than might justly be inferred from a general  
presumption, arising from the course of our com-  
merce. To apply such an intention, in a particujar  
case to the predjudice of an individual ; to presume  
that he has voluntarily incurred an immense risk,  
which, consistently with the success of his main ob-  
ject, he might have fairly avoided, and to inyolve  
him in ruin for prosecuting a trade, which, if un-  
dertaken with a different motive, would have been  
declared law ful ;—would be, in the opinion of your  
mieniorialists, to confound and reverse the best ¢s-  
tablished principles of reason, equity and law.  
  
Your memorialists contend for no innovations, on  
the law of nations ; and, except where special trea-  
ties have prescribed a different rule, they adinit that  
they may lawfully be restrained from transporting  
the property of the parties engaged in war. In the  
recent decision, which prohibits an importer cf co-  
lonial produce from exporting it to Erope, they  
however perceive with concern, either a nugatory  
and vexatious regulation, or a meditated-blow, at  
what they deem an incontestib!e and valuable right.  
  
Heretofore there existed clear and obvious cir-  
cumstances of discrimination, between the direct  
trade, which Great-Britain has assumed the right  
of denying to neutrals, and the indirect or circuitous  
trade, winch she admits to be lawful. The direct  
trade could be performed by a single shipment or  
voyage; whereas, the circuitous trade subjecied the  
property to double freights and insurances, to de-  
ductions in favor of the revenue, and various other  
expences in this country.  
  
If the arrival of aship in the country to which she  
belongs to the landing of the cargo; the inspection  
of the Custom House ; the payment or security of  
duties ; do not terminate a voyage; then weconfess  
our ignorance on a point, which, never haying been  
before questioned, has been assumed by us as an ac-  
knowledged truth. If the entry for exportation ;  
the embarkation of merchandize ; the re-inspection  
of the Custom House: the bond tor securing a de-  
livery in a foreign country, and a public clearance,  
do not indicate the commencement of a new voy-  
age, then we are yet to learn the meaning of the  
expression. If all the formalities and sanctions es-  
tablished for the security of our revenue; if opera-  
tions of immense magnitude, transacted with the  
greatest publicity, ang without any motive for con-  
cealment, are considered QB unreal represencarions  
and merely colourable and fraudulent contrivances  
to cover an illicit trade, between the colonies and the  
parent countries of the enemies of Great-Britain ;  
then it becomes necessary, both in rc gard to our  
characters and interests,to inquire, whether the new  
regulations establish a more definite criterion for the  
discovery of truth?  
  
We repel with indignation the suggestion, that  
the trans-shipment of property for a ioreign market  
by the original importer, is evidence of fraud and  
chicane; or that, unsupported by other circums’an-  
ces, it can jastify a suspicion, thar it is other than  
neutral. In our opinion, any discrimination be-  
tween the rights of aa importing merchant, and a  
vendee in the United States, is manifesily fallacious,  
as it virtually asserts, that the former can exercise  
only an imperfect domini« over property law fully  
acquired, and possessed in tluis country, while at  
the tame time he can convey to the latter a title ro  
a privilege not enjoyed by hiniself: ia short, that a  
trade is unfawful, when the advantage is te recuit to  
one person, but may be rendered lawfu&#x27;, by being  
  
parcic ipated with another.  
  
If the new doctrise is executed in the mildest  
form, ics Operation must be highly injurious, by o-  
rigimaung new quésuons for litigatioy and of course,  
subjecting our! commerce to new hazards of iver-  
ruption. We presume not, however, to compre-  
head to what extent, or in what manner the pritici-  
ple wilt be applied: we perceive, that the ancient  
land-mark has been removed, but we seek in vain  
for a beacon to direct our course ,—If we enquire  
wheiher a doua file sale and delivery of -mercnan-  
dize, by an im porter, being a ciiizen to anoxler  
known citizen of the United States for a valuable  
cowsideration, veill, as in ordinary cases, be conclu-  
sive evidence of a transfer of property, ard the an-  
swer is alfirmative; then we complain that our  
ships have been detained, the ra:es of insurance en-  
hauced, and our property confiscated, for the esiab-

lishment of a rule, which, when once understood,  
  
will become nugatory, and cease to preduce any  
commercial or political effect. If on the other hand,  
this evidence is not to be deemed conclusive, we  
profess ourselves to be utterly at a loss to discover,  
what proofs of ownership, and neutrality of proper-  
ty, can withsafety be relied on.  
  
But these embarrassments, though perplexing and  
vexat ons, are not those which principally occasion  
our solicitude, We are compelled to consider the  
late decisions of the Brirish tr benals, as prelimina-  
ry steps towards a system for controlling the im»  
portations and expogrations of ¢ lonial produ.tions,  
and thereby annihia ing the must lucrative branches  
of our foreign commerce.  
  
If we owed this trade solely to the favor of  
Great-Britaia ; still we might ask, wha urgent mo-  
tive, what imperious necessity, required that the fa-  
vour should be resumed; at a period when our  
commet-: was spread over the ocean, and when a  
change «o essential might destroy its security, and  
subject us to incalculable losses.  
  
We deny, however, that the rights of commerce,  
as claimed by us, are to be deémed favors; on the  
contrary, if the law of nations other than a tempora-  
rule, prescribed by an arbitrary will, and enforced  
by power, then we appeal to its most universal and  
inviolable principle, in our defence. This principle  
is, that the Goons of a NEUTRAL, Consisting of arti-  
cles not CONTRABAND Of WAR, in d NEUTRAL VES-  
SEL,employed ina DIRECT TRADE,between NEUTRAL  
counrriges, and ports of a BELLIGERENT COUNe  
TRY not INVESTED or BLOCKADED, are protect-  
ed.  
  
In the controversies which have exisied at differ-  
ent times, for extending the privileges of neutral  
vessels, and limiting the grounds of capture, we  
take no part: we appeal to the oldlaw. If neu-  
tral rights can be reduced within more confined  
limits than this law prescribes, we perceive not  
how, amidst the collisions of national interests, any  
neutral Commerce can exist, evenin Our natuve pro-  
ductions.  
  
If it be intimated, that neutrals should be confin-  
ed to acommerce with such places, and in such ar-  
ticles only as were allowed in peace, by the munici-  
pal regulations of the countries engaged in war ; the  
doctrine may be repelled by the notorious fact, that  
no such principle has governed the conduct of na-  
tious, during any wars in which they have been en-  
gaged: all were free to vary, and in fact all have  
varied, their commercial systems: whatever theo-  
retical opinions may therefore have been advanced,  
there has existed no such practical rule, andto set uy)  
such a rule, under che unparalleled circumstances of  
the present war, must infallibly destroy the com-  
merce of this country.  
  
It is a well known fact, that the people of the U-  
nited States export to foreign countries a greaier  
proportiou of the aggregate annual value of the pro-  
ducts ef their indusiry, than any other people of the  
globe; they are consequently most deeply interested  
in the security and freedom of their trade: in short,  
being almost exclusively a agricultural and com-  
mercial people, those parts of our country, which,  
from recent settlement, or from other circumstances,  
are wholly agricultural, are more immediately inter-  
ested than any other, as they aré in a greater degree  
deperdent on foreign supplies, and consequently  
most lable to be affected, by any vibrations of the  
com mercial system  
  
_ #8 our manufactures do not flourish in propor-  
tion to the progress ef ow: population, wealth and  
luxury, the necessiry of extending our commerce is  
constantly increasing.  
  
The basis of all our trade is the aggregate value  
of our native preductions, exceeding what are con-

A very great proportion of all the results of our

from that country, our cloathiag, and other neces-

sequences of the assumed rule, that neutrais may be  
restrained, in time of war, to their accustomed trade  
The injussice of such a rule, in  
relation to the United S ates, will be more manifest :  
the individuals employed in commerce, would not a-  
lone be affected; all the internal relations of our  
country would be disturbed ; the in‘erests of those  
districts which are most remcte from our principal  
ports, would, in proportion to their dependence on  
foreiga supplies, be uirst severely depressed,  
  
The effects of war cannot be confined to the coua-  
tries engaged in war. The value of mongy; the price  
of Jabour; the raies of freight and insurance, are  
by law embraced threughout the world ; ail articles  
of merchandize, both of export and wmport, are  
variously affected, in their qualities and value, b)  
new wants ; by the relinguishment of common  
pursuits, and by the new direccion which is thereby  
given to the industry of different nations— Orher  
consequences resul: from the effects of war; as the  
impoverishment af some, and the aggrandizement  
of other countries: also, from the acknowledged  
right of beilgerent nations to interdict commerce  
in contraband articles, and to institute blockades.  
This last right is highly injurious to neutrals, as it  
frequently restrains thein from proceeding to the  
best markets, it is obviously impossible, therefore,  
to confine the United S:ates in time of war, amidst  
all these changes and disadvantages, to their accus-  
tomed trade in time of peace, without destroying all  
trade.  
  
If, in consequence of the war, certain articles u-  
  
‘gually exported from the United S:ates to countries  
  
from which we received necessary supplies, cease to  
be demanded in those countries, may we not export  
other articles, and thereby obtain the supplies we  
need ?  
  
If articles usually imported into the United States  
in time of peace, cease to be demandeui by u: in time  
of war, in consequence of our ability to obtain sub-  
stitutes which we prefer, shall we be required to  
renounce our export trade, by being forbid to import  
other articles for consumption or for commerce ? or  
shall we be compelled to receive in exchange, artic-  
les which we do not require ?  
  
If, in consequence of an increased demand for  
our exports to particular couttries, we cbtain in  
exchange, articles of commerce exceeding cur do-  
mestic wars, shall it be required that the surplus  
perish on our hands ? ‘  
  
If Great Gritain permits commerce between her  
subjects and the ‘colonies of her enemies, may we not,  
with the consent of those colonies, participate in  
the same commerce ?  
  
If our commerce with the enemies of ‘Great  
Britain may now be confined to the system establisi-  
edin timeof peace, may we not apprehend that the  
principle will be retaliated, in respect to eur com-  
merce with the colonies of Great Britain? in that  
cns2, whatcaneasue but war, pillage and devasta-  
tion?  
  
These are not imaginary smppositions ; they illus-  
trare the-most important principles ef our com-  
merce ; th y evince the necessity of a circustious  
trade, to enable us to realize the great value of ex-  
ports ia our native productions, by which alone we  
acquire the power toliquideie the balance agaist us,  
in Our Comm -rce with Great Britain : they demon-  
Strate, that the position against which we contend,  
is nora rule of the law of nations; the law of na-  
tions ordamns no rule which is unequal and ur just.  
  
But sti we have other and more forcible obj.ct-  
tions; the consession which is required wou&#x27;d de-  
pruve us of many advantages, counccted with our  
local situation, our enterprise, our wealth, and our  
fortune; it would require us to divert much of  
our capital and industry to new employments ; it  
would amount to an abandonment of wews, as a  
commercial people, and night invo.ve us in danger-  
ous Controversies, by virtual admission, that any  
€ssential articles of supply may, atthe ploasure of  
a belligerent nation, be placed ina state of jab bi-  
tion, eguivalent to being declared contraband of  
war.  
  
Hitherto we have regarded it as a pecul&#x27;ar felicity  
incident to cur neutral situation, that it was equally  
beneficial to ourselves, and to al! the parties with  
whom we are connecied ; the articles exported by  
us to the enemies of Great Britain being convenient  
supplies—promised to secure to our ships in their  
ports a welcome reception and hospitable treatment.  
As the direct returns for the exports were inconsid-  
erable, aud asthe products were almost exclusively  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ee nt ee er A Re ye  
  
  
  
remitted to Great Britain, cod thereby apy hed in  
payment for manufacteres purchaicd on omr ac-  
Count, we consid: rcd oursclves sure: of receiving  
from thei, atleast thac degree of protection,which  
was recommended by a reg. cd to noutual imer-  
ests.  
  
It is however with much surprize that we have  
recently discovered that the very circumastances up-  
on which cur hopes of security are reposed, have  
been urged as argmren&#x27;s to justify aw imvasicn of  
our rights, and that, having totally suppressed the  
external commerce of her enemies, Great Britain is  
now counselled to appropriate to herself that cf her  
friends. li i be true that, at exporters of certain  
articles to the ultmmate marke:s, our interests are in  
collission with hers 5 yet it ougit to be receilectcd,  
that it js a particular and minor interest only which  
Suffers, Nad that the disadvantage 15.2 necessary cen-  
Kequence cf her colonial system ;: ‘that the general  
results of our commerce are greatly in her favor :  
that they invigorate her majiufacturing interests,  
which are the great basis of her wealth: and thar  
these interests can never be promoted by the impov-  
erishment of her customers. Surely the sectirity of  
neutral rights ought tiot. to diminish, as their value  
is augmented : surely a maritime preponderancy,  
which enables its possessors to blockade any of the  
ports of its enemies, conveys no just title to a mo-  
nopoly of the commerce of the-world !,  
  
n the list of our complaints, we cannot forbear  
mo enumerate the humiliating and oppressive con-  
duct of ships of war, in the vicinity of our coasts  
and harb rs. We respect the principle and emulate  
the conduct of Great Britain, in regard to our juris-  
diction, and we wish merely to claim for ourselves  
the same measure of justice which she exacts from  
others,  
  
But while we contend that we ought, not to be ex-  
posed to humiliating inquisitions in the verge of « ur  
ports, which by means of secret connections with  
our city, maybe rendered conducive to the imdul-  
gence of partiality, favor or malice, we disavow  
every wish to divest.the belligerent nations of their  
rights. If, in particular iastances, the American  
fiag, and the character of an American merchant,  
have been prostituted to unworthy purposes, we  
declare the individuals thas guilty to be our enemies,  
and we wish not to screen them from the just con-  
sequences of their misconduct. We alsoassert,that  
a comprehensive view of our commerce affords con-  
clusive evidence, that ef the property circulated  
through this port, the proportion which can possi-  
bly belong to the enemies of Great Britain, is an ob-  
jec€ unworthy the attention of agreat power 4 espe-  
cially, af ina rigorous pursuit of its strict rights, it  
incurs the hazard of forleiting the esteem of its  
friends.  
  
li therefore, the mode in which the American  
commerce is prosecuted, is allowed by the law  
of nations ; if irrefragable evidence arises from  
our situaton, wants, and necessary connections  
with the sest of the world, that itis almost exciu-  
sively growded on Ammerican capital ; if the sug-  
gestions, that we are the mere agents of foreign-  
ers, ere ungenerous insulis, coniryed as apologies  
forinjuries ; if frauds in relation to foreign trusts,  
are not more frequent in this country than in Great  
Brirain ; and if no government is able wholly to  
prevent them: then our cenclusion in the pre-  
sent, as inall other cases, ought to be deducted from  
general facts, and not from particular exceptions.  
‘this conchsgion is, that the American commerce  
is one of the great links which connect those in-  
terests of civilized mations which wars ought not  
to disturb 4 that to break this link, wili deatroy all  
commerce, and therefore, that a serious misunder-  
standing with Great Britain would prove fatal ‘to  
the most important interests of both countries,  
  
This view of the subject, while i excites our  
anxiety, fur:ishes, also a resource for cvr hopes.  
We wish only for justice ‘and believirg thata  
commercial nation which disregards justice, there-  
by undermines the citadel of her power, we rely  
on the eflect of murual interests and wishes in pro-  
mong a cordial explana ion, and for adjustment  
of every cause cf misunderstanding : in particular  
ve rely en the government of our country, that our  
rights will not be abandoned, that no argument im  
favor of an usurpation will ever be derived from  
our acquiescence.  
  
If our personal interests and Jocal attachments  
have not greatly misdirected ovr opimons, the de-  
fenceless si uation of the port of New-York, onght

proporson as the resources ef cur Coun’ ry. aceumu-  
late to this point is the hazard, . that they may pre-  
sent a ten ptation te rapacity, and become the prize  
cf violence. Without recurring to the experience  
of past times for proofs, that no nation can bong  
Maintain an exteasive commerce, wihout weil de-  
fended cca ports, and an eficientmilitary marine,  
we are admonished by the new and porietous as-  
pect of Europe, and the alarming prevalence of pi-  
racy in the West Indies, that energetic measures  
of defence have become indispensably necessary.  
We presume not to express any cpinion 1¢3-  
  
pecting the degree of force, of which the :  
navy ought to consist ; and being segeitla Vent Ao-  
lays must attend the corststietion of suitable de-  
fences for our port, we shall rest satisfied, when -  
we perceive that these measures are commenced  
in a manner, and upon a scale, which will assure  
tous aneffcent completion. 7  
  
Such however, is the organized force of  
the Uniced States that we should consider if incon-  
sistent with the honor, interests, or security  
country, to parley with the pirates of rs  
Indies, whose coaduct being inconsisteat with any”  
known rules of lawful warfare, cannot havebeen ~  
authorized by any civilized nation towardsanother —  
nation, in a state of peace. Our vessels, while pur- ~  
suing a lawful trade, have been piratieally seized  
their cargoes have been forcibly taken away and  
distributed, without eved the form ofatrial; the  
vessels in many instances sunk and destroyed, and  
the crews stripped of all their property ; all these  
outrages have been exercised upon immocent and de-  
fenceless men, aggravated by upprecedented cir-  
cumstances of insult, oppression, and barbarity.  
Some of these violences have been committedon -  
vessels which were captured within sight of opr  
harbors ; and the great scene of those unparallel-  
led enormities is the island of Cuba, which com-  
mands the only avenue by which we preserve 2  
commercial connec.ion with our brethren of the  
Western States : a connection which we cherish  
with ardor, asa source of mutual advantage, and  
a bord of permanent onion.  
  
But it is not on account of ovr pecuniary losses  
alone that we complam. The constancy and valour  
of the seamen of the United States, are justly  
themes of patriotic exultation. From their connex-  
ion with us we consider their cause as our cause,  
their rights as our rights, and their imierests as eur  
interests ; our feelings are indignant at the recital  
of their-wrongs; and we request, in addition to  
the protection ofa naval force, that, at least ja  
the American seas, ove brave countrymen, may be  
permiced to display tex energy in theirown de-  
fence. #)  
  
Your memorialists conclude with remarking that  
they deem the present situation of the public a®  
feivs to be peculiarly critical and perilous, and such  
as requires allthe prudence, the wisdom, and en-

YOUR Memorialists beg leave respectfally to ap-  
&#x27; proach the gevernment of their country, on sub-  
jects of great ortance, which have affected their  
t anxiety and alarm.  
Confiding’in the justice and friendly dispositions  
. of the government of Great-Britain, and entertain-  
ing a correspondent expectation that no unusual re-  
strictiots would be imposed on Neutral Commerce,  
without adequate motives and the most ample notice ;  
presuming pero that commercial enterprizes,  
commenced under sanction of established prin-  
, ope would on no account be affected by a change  
of system; your memorialists have employed a vast  
je in importing various colonial productions,  
the surplus of which, exceeding the demands of this  
country, they have been accustomed to export free-  
ly to the different markets of Europe,  
After this commerce had been prosecuted with-  
out restriction for several years, and had attracted  
  
a ortion of their wealth; after their in-  
Leuinbed acswoned immense responsibilitres, ground.  
ed on an opinion that his ade: was shite is regu-  
lar; having never received the slightest intimation,  
that it could be deemed incompatible with the rights  
ot igerent nation, they have been suddenly  
  
* confounded, by unexpected inrelligeace of the arres-  
_ tation on the high seas, of a large  
  
ion of their  
property, which had been embarked with the most  
unsuspecting confidence.  
  
The feelings of your memorialists are not only ex-  
cited by the losses they have actually sustained, in  
consequence of a measure unsusceptible of previous  
calculation, butalso from ihe state of uncertainty in  
whieh they are placed, with respect to future com-  
mercial operations. |  
  
Your memorialists have heretofore believed that  
commerce between the United States and colonies  
subject to the enemies of Great-Britain, when dona  
fie ced on their own account, would be per-  
fecthy safe from interruption: They have also be-  
lieved, that all articles, which might be securely im-  
ported into the United States, might be as securely  
  
exported ; -with the exceptions well understood, both  
m respect to the importand export trade of com-  
merce with places blockaded, or in articles contra-  
band of war.  
  
In a recent interpretation of what is considered  
  
by the tribunals of Great-Britain as a direct trade, .  
  
between the cdlonies and ‘the parent countries of  
heir enemies, your meinorialists perceive with con-  
cern, the developement of a principle. which if con-  
  
ceded on by ee! of the United Staies, must prove  
fatal to their mmercial imporiance.

necessarily revokable by those who form them ;&amp;an  
intention which has not been executed, proves nothing  
more than might justly be inferred from a general  
presumption, arising from the course of our com-  
merce. To apply such an intention, in a particular  
  
| case to the predjudice of an individual ; to presume  
  
that he has voluntarily incurred an immense msk,  
which, consistently with the success of his main ob-  
ject, he might have fairly avoided, and to involve  
him in ruin for prosecuting a trade, which, if un-  
dertaken witha different motive, would have been  
declared law ful ;—would be, in the opinion of your  
miemorialists, to confound and reverse the best es-  
tablished principles of reason, equity and law.  
  
Your memorialists contend for no innovations, on  
the law of nations ; and, except where special trea-  
ties have prescribed a different rule, they admit that  
they may lawfully be restrained from transporting  
the property of the parties engaged in war, Ir. the  
recent decision, which prohibits an importer cf co-  
lonial produce from exporting it to Enrope, they  
however perceive with concern, either a nugatory  
and ‘vexatious regulation, or a meditated-blow, at  
what they deem an incontestib!e and valuable right.  
  
Heretofore there existed clear and obvious cir-  
cumstances of discrimination, between the direct  
trade, which Great-Britain has assumed the right  
of denying to neutrals, and the indirect or cércuétous

red @B unreal represeniarions  
and merely colpurable and fraudulent contrivances  
to cover an illicit trade, between the colonies and the  
parent countries of the enemies of Great-Britain ;  
then it becomes necessary, both in rc gard to our  
characters and interests,to inquire, whether the new  
regulations establish a more definite criterion for the  
discovery of truth?  
  
We repel with indignation the suggestion, that  
the trans-shipment of property for a icreign market  
by the original importer, is evidence of fraud and  
chicane; or that, unsupported by other ciucums&#x27;an-  
ces, it can jastify a su-picion, that it is other than  
neutral. In our opinion, any discrimination be-  
tween the rights of aw importing merchant, and a  
  
-vendee in the United States, is munifesily fallacious,  
as it virtually asserts, that the former can exercise  
only an imperfect domini&#x27;. over property law fully  
acquired, and possessed in this country, while at  
the same time he can convey to the latter a title to  
a privilege not enjoyed by himself: ia short, that a  
trade is unfawfol, when the advantage is te re.uit to  
one person, but may be rendered lawfu&#x27;, by being  
parcicipated with another,  
  
If the new doctrine is executed in the mildest  
form, ics operation must be highly injurious, by o-  
rigimating new quésuions for litigatoyand of course,  
subjecting our commerce to new hazards of iver-  
ruprion. We presume not, however, to compre-  
head to what extent, or in what manner the princi.

will become nugatory, and cease to produce any

this evidence is not to be deemed conclusive, we  
profess ourselves to be utterly at a loss to discover,  
whar proofs of ownership, and neutrality of proper-

But these embarrassments, though perplexing and  
vexat ous, are not those which principally occasion  
our solicitude, We are compelled to consider the  
late decisions of the British tr bunals, as prelimina-  
ry steps towards a system for controlling the im»  
portations and expagrations of colonial productions,  
and thereby annihifa ing the mvs lucrative branches  
of our foreign commerce.  
  
If we owed this trade solely to the favor of  
Great-Britaia; still we might ask, wha urgent mo-

commet-: was spread over the ocean, and when a  
change +o essential might destroy its security, and  
subject us to incalculable losses.

as claimed by us, are to be deémed favors; on the  
contrary, if the taw of nations other than a tempora-

cles not CONTRABAND Of WAR, iu d NEUTRAL VES-  
SEL,employedina DIRECT TRADE,between NEUTRAL  
counrRiges, and ports of ad BELLIGERENT COUNe  
TRY not INVESTED or BLOCKADED, are protect-  
ed.  
  
In the controversies which have exisied at differ-  
ent times, for extending the privileges of neutral  
vessels, and limiting the grounds of capture, we  
take no part: we appealto the oldlaw. If neu-  
tral rights can be reduced within more confined  
limits than this law prescribes, we perceive not  
how, arm:dst the collisions of national interests, any  
neutral Commerce can exist, even in Our native pro-  
ductions.  
  
If it be intimated, that neutrals should be confin-  
ed to acomimerce with such places, and in such ar-  
ticles only as were allowed in peace, by the munici-  
pal regulations of the countries engaged in war; the  
doctrine may be repelled by the notorious fact, that  
no such principle has governed the conduct of na-  
tiows, during any wars in which they have been en-  
gaged: all were free to vary, and in fact all have  
varied, their commercial systems: whatever theo-  
retical opinions may therefore have been advanced,  
there has existed no such practical rule, andto set up)  
such a rule, under the unparalleled circumstances of  
the present war, must infallibly destroy the com-  
merce of this country.  
  
It is a well known fact, that the people of the U-  
nited States export to fore gn countries a greaier  
proportion of the aggregate aunual value of the pro-  
ducts ef their indusiry, than any other people of the  
globe; they are consequently most deeply interested  
in the security and freedom of their trade: in short,  
being alinost exclusively an agricultural and com-  
mercial people, those parts of our country, which,  
from recent settlement, or from other circumstances,  
are wholly agricultural, are more immediately inter-  
ested han any other, as they aré in a greater degree  
deperdent on foreign supplies, and consequent! +  
most lable to be affected, by any vibrations of the  
com mercial system  
  
_ 48 our manvfactures do not flourish in propor-  
  
tion to the progress ef ow population, wealrh and  
luxury, the necessity of extending our commerce is  
constantly increasing.  
  
The basis of all our traJe is the aggregate value  
of our native productions, exce eding what are con-  
sumed in the United States: these are exported to  
various Countries, from which we receiye supplies,  
for domestic&#x27;use, or other articles for exportation,  
A very great proportion of all the sesulis of our  
commerce with the world, centre in the dominions  
of Great Britain, and we receive almost exclusively  
from that country, our cloathiag, and other neces-  
sary manufactures.  
  
By the events of the late and present war, many  
countries with which we prosecured an increasing  
trade, have been either diverted from manufactur-  
ing pursuits, or have been greatly tmpoverished, or  
conquered and subjected to the colonial system of  
Great Britain.  
  
With these preliminary facts in view. we rceqaest

sequences of the assumed rule, that neutrals may be  
vestrdined, in time of war, to their accustomed trade  
The injuscice of such a rule, in  
relation to the United S ates, will be more manifest :  
the individuals employed in commerce, would not a-  
lone be affected; all the internal relations of our  
country would be disturbed ; the incerests of those  
districts which are most remcte from our principal  
ports, would, in proportion to their dependence on  
foreigu supplies, be mist severely depressed.  
‘The effects of war cannot be confined to the coun-  
tries engaged in war. The value of iongy, the price  
of Jabour; the rates of freight and insurance, are  
by law embraced threughout the world ; all articles  
of merchandize, both of export and ymport, are  
variously affected, in their qualities and value, b)  
new wants; by the relinguishment of common  
pursuits, and by the new direcsion which is thereby  
given to the industry of different nations— Ocher  
consequences resul: from the effects of war; as the  
impoverishment of some, and the aggrandizement  
of other countries: also, from the acknowledged  
right of belligerent nations to interdict commerce  
in contraband articles, and to institute bl ckades.  
This last right is highly injuri»usto neutrals, as it  
frequently restrains thein from proceeding to the  
best markets, it is obviously impossible, therefore,  
to confine the United S:ates in time of war, amidst  
all these changes and disadvantages, to their accus-  
tomed trade in time of peace, without destroying all  
trade.  
If, in consequence of the war, certain articles u-  
  
‘sually exported from the United Siates to countries  
  
from which we received necessary supplles, cease to  
be demanded in those countries, may we not export  
other articles, and thereby obtain the supphes we  
need ?  
  
If articles usually imported into the United States  
in time of peace, cease to be demandeti by us in time  
of war, in consequence of our ability to obtain sub-  
stitutes which we prefer, shall we be required to  
renounce our export trade, by being forbid to import  
other articles for consumption or for commerce ? or  
shall we be compelled to receive in exchange, artic-  
les which we do not require ?  
  
If, in consequence of an increased demand for  
our exports to -particular countries, we cbtain in  
exchange, articles of commerce exceeding our do-  
mestic wars, shall it be required that the surplus  
perish on our hands ? .  
  
If Great Britain permits commerce between her  
subjecis and the colonies of her enemies, may we net,  
with the consent of those eolonies, participate in  
the same commerce ?  
  
If ovr commerce with the enemics of ‘Great  
Britain may now be Confined to the system establisi-  
ed iv time of peace, may we not apprehend that the  
principle will be retaliated, in respect to eut com-  
n.erce with the colonies of Great Britain? in that  
cos:, whatcan ensue but war, pillage and devasta-  
tion ?  
  
These are not imaginary swppositions : they illus-  
trate the most important principles cf our com-  
merce ; th y evince the necessity of a circurtious  
twade, to enable us to realize the great value of ex-  
ports ia our native productions, by which alone we  
acquire the power toligquidaie the balance agai ist us,  
i Our Comm ce with Great Britain: they demon-  
Sirate, that the position against which we contend,  
is nota rule of the law of nations; the law of na-  
tions ordains no rule which is unequal and vw: just.  
  
But st&#x27;li we have other and more forcible. obj.ct-  
thons; the consession which is reqiured wou&#x27;d ce-  
prove us of many advantages, counccted with our  
local Situation, our enterprise, our wealth, and our  
fortune; it would require us to divert much of  
our Capital and industry to new employments , it  
would amount to an abandonment of wews, as a  
©ommercial people, and might invo.ve us in danger-  
OuS Controversies, by virtual admission, that any  
€éssential articles of supply may, atthe pleasure of  
a belligerent nation, be placed ina state of iabibi-  
tion, eguivalent to being declared contraband of  
war.  
  
Hitherto we have regarded it as a pecul&#x27;ar felicity  
incident to cur neutral situation, that it was equally  
beneficial! to ourselve:, and to al! the parties “with  
whom we are connecied; the articles exported by  
1s to the enemies of Great Britain being convenient  
tupplies—promised to secure to our ships in their  
ports a welcome reception and hospitable treatment.  
As the direct returns for the exports were inconsid-  
erable, and asthe products were almost exclusively

a  
  
remitted to Great Britain, cod thereby apphed in  
payment for manufactores purcha:cd on omr ac-  
count, we consid: rcd ourselves sure: of receiving  
from then, atleast thar degree of protection,which  
was recommended by a reg. d to nautual imer-  
ests.  
  
It is however with much surprize that. we have  
recently discovered that the very circurastances up-  
on which our hopes of security are reposed, have  
been urged as argmretts to justify ant imvasicn of  
our rights, and that, having totally suppressed the  
external commerce cf her enemies, Great Britain is  
now counselled to appropriate to herself that cf her  
friends, Ii i be true that, at exporters of certain  
articles to the ultimate markers, our interests are in  
coilission with hers 4 yet it ought to be reccilected,  
that it js a particular and minor interest only which  
suffers, Nad that the disadvantage 15 2 necessary ccn-  
Kequence cf her colonial system : that the general  
results of our commerce are greatly in her favor :  
that they invigorate her mapufacturing interests,  
which are the great basis of her wealth: and thar  
these interests can never be promoted by the inmipov-  
erishment of hes customers. Swrely the security of  
neutral rights ought fiot. to diminish, as their value  
1s augmented : surely a maritime preponderancy,  
which enables its possessors to blockade any of the  
ports of its enemies, conveys no just title to a mo-  
nopoly of the commerce of the world !,  
  
n the list of our complaints, we cannot forbear  
#o enumerate the humiliating and oppressive con-  
duct of ships of war, in the vicinity of our coasts  
and harb rs. We respect the principle and emulate  
the conduct of Great Britain, in regard to our juris-  
diction, and we wish merely to clarm for ourselves  
the same measure of justice which she exacts from  
others,  
  
But while we contend that we ought not to be ex-  
posed to humiliating inquisitions in the verge of «ur  
ports, which by means of secret connections with  
our city, maybe rendered conducive to the imdul-  
gence of partiality, favor er malice, we disavow  
every wish to divest the belligerent nations of their  
rights. If, in particular iastances, the American  
flag, and the character of an American merchant,  
have been prostituted to unworthy purposes, we  
declare the individuals thas guilty to be our enemies,  
and we wish not to screen them from the just con-  
sequences of their misconduct. We alsoassert,that  
a comprehensive view of our commerce affords con-  
clasive evidence, that ef the property circulated  
through this port, the proportion which can possi-  
bly belong to the enemies ot Great Britain, is an ob-  
jec@ unworthy the attention of agreat power ; espe-  
cially, af ina rigorous pursuit of its strict rights, it  
incurs the hazard of forleiting the esteem of its  
fnends.  
  
li therefore, the mode in which the American  
commerce is prosecuted, is allowed by the law  
of nations ; if irrefragable evidence arises from  
our situaton, wants, and necessary connections  
with the sest of the world, tha: itts almost exciu-  
sively grow ded on American cap tal ; if the sug-  
gestions, that we are the mere agents of foreign-  
ers, ere ungenerous insulis, couirived as apulogies  
forinjuries ; if frauds in relation to foreign trusts,  
are not more frequent in this country than jin Great  
Briain ; and if no government is able wholly to  
prevent them: then our cenclasion in the pre-  
  
sen!, as in all other cases, ought to be deducted from  
general facts, and not from particular exceptions.  
‘this conchygion is, that the American commerce  
is one of the great links which connect those in-  
terests of civilized mations which wars ought not  
to distnrb 4 that to break this link, will destroy all  
commerce, and therefore, that a serious misunder-  
standing with Great Britain would prove fatal ‘to  
the most important interests of both countries,  
  
This view of the subject, while it excites our  
anxiety, fur:ishes, also a resource for cur hopes.  
We wish only for justice: and believirg that a  
comm&lt;rcial nation which disregards justice, there-  
by undermines the citadel ofher power, we rely  
on the eflect of murua} interests and wishes in pro-  
moting a cordial explana ion, and for adjustment  
of every cause cf misunderstanding : in particular  
vee rely en the government of our country, that our  
rights will not be abandoned, that no argument im  
favor of an usurpation will ever be derived from  
our acquiescence.  
  
If our personal interests and Jocal attachments  
have wot greatly misdirected our opinions, the de-

Tate to this point is the hazard, that they may pre-

of past times for proofs, that no nation can bong  
Maintain an extensive commerce, wihout well de-  
fended sea ports, and an efficient military marine,  
we are admonished by the new and porresitows as-  
pect of Europe, and the alarming prevales.ce of pi-  
racy in the West Indies, that energetic measures  
of defence have become indispensably mecessary.  
We presume not to express any cpinion 1¢s-  
pecting the degree of force, of which the permanent.  
  
navy ought to consist; and being sensible that de-  
lays must attend the conststietion of suitable de-  
fences for our port, we shall rest satisfied, when  
  
we perceive that these measures are commenced  
in a manner, and upon a scale, which will assure  
tous aneffc:ent compjeticn. on  
Such however, is the organized force of  
the United States that we should consider if ivcon-  
sistent with the honor, interests, or security  
country, to parley with the pirates of est-  
  
Indies, whose couduct being inconsist benny  
  
known rules of lawful warfare, cannot have been  
authorized by any civilized nation towards another  
nation, ina state of peace. Our vessels, while pur-  
suing a lawful trade, have been piratieally seized  
their cargoes have been forcibly taken away and  
distribured, without eved the form ofatrial; the  
vessels in many instances sunk and destroyed, and  
the crews stripped of all their property ; ail these  
outrages have been exercised imrocent and de-  
fenceless men, aggravated by upprecedented cir-  
cumstances of insult, oppression, and barbarity.  
Some of these violences have been committed on  
vessels which were captured within sight of our  
harbors ; and the great scene of those unparallel-  
led enormities is the island of Cuba, which com-  
minds the only avenue by which wepresérve 2  
commercial connec.ion with our brethren of the  
Western States; a connection which we cherish  
with ardor, as a source ef motual advantage, and  
a bord of permanent onion.  
  
But it js not on account of our pecuniary losses  
alone that We complam. The constancy and valour  
of the seamen. of the United tates, are justly  
themes of patriotic exultation. From their connex-  
ion with vs we consider their cause as our cause,  
their rights as opr rights, and their imerests as our  
interests ; our feelings ase indignant at the recital  
of ther-wrongs; and we request, in addition to  
the protection ofa naval force, that, at least ja  
the American seas, our brave countrymen, may be  
permicned to display ten energy in theirown ce-  
fence. *  
  
Your memorialists conclude with remarking that  
they deem the present si‘uation of the public af  
fairs to be peculiarly critical and perilous, and such  
as requires allthe prudence, the wisdem, and en-

The feelings of your memorialists arc not  
only excited by the losses which they have  
actually sustained, in consequence of a mea­  
sure unsusceptible of previous calculation,  
but also from the state of uncertainty in  
which they are placed, with respect to future  
commercial operations, i .  
&#x27; Your memorialists heretofore believed that  
commerce- between- the- United -States -and  
colonies subject to the enemies ofGreat-Britain,  
wheniju f.de prosecuted on their owl) !  
account, would be perfectly afe from inter-&#x27;  
&quot;Vuption: &#x27; They&#x27; hare also believed, that all!  
articles, which might be securely imparted  
intd &quot;thc&quot;Ufilied States, might be as secure­  
ly &#x27;exported ; with , the exception well un­  
derstood, both in respect to the, import and  
export trade of commerce with places  
Xlocladed, or itr articles contraband of war.  
In a recent interpretation of what is con­  
sidered by the tribunals of Great-Britain as  
&#x27;a direct trads between the Colonics and the  
parent countries of their enemies, jour me­  
morialists perceive with concern, the devc­  
lopementofa principle, which, it conceded  
on the part of the United Stales must prufc  
fatal to their commercial importance.  
&#x27;It is understood to have been decided,  
that whenever it appears to be the intention  
of the importer of colonial produce, to tx-  
fiott the same to Europe ; or, whenever it  
s o exported by thte original importer, such  
latentiuh or exportation,&#x27; shall be evidence  
of a dtrett tradttm Subject the property,  
though neutral, &#x27;o confiscation.  
Your memorialists consider it, their bou:i­  
den duty to themselves, and their country, to  
express their most decided opposition to this  
  
decision.  
As to the evidence arising from the suppos­  
ed intention of an importer, they readily ad--  
rnit, that the great quantities of colonial pro­  
duce which are. acquired by means of the  
&#x27; American commerce, exceeding the demand

both in regard to our characters and inter-&quot;  
eats, to inquire, whether the new&#x27;regulationv  
  
establish, a more definite criterion for the dis- j  
  
cbvery of truth f r ;  
&#x27; We repel with indignation the suggestion,  
that the trans-shipment of property for a for­  
eign market, by the original importer, is e­  
vidence of fraud or chicane; or that unsup.  
ported by other circumstance&#x27;s, it can justify  
&#x27;a suspicion, that it is other than neutral. In  
our opinion, any discrimination between the  
rights of an importing merchant, and a ven  
  
.dee in the United Slates, is manifestly fal  
  
lacious, as it virtually metis, that the for­  
mer can exercise only an imperfect dominion  
  
over property lawfully acquired, and posses­  
sed in this country, while at the same time  
  
he can convey to the latter a title to a privi­  
lege not enjoyed by himself j in short, that  
a trade is unlawful, when the advantage is to  
result to one person, but may be rendered  
lawful, by being participated with another.  
i If the new doctrine is executed in the mild­  
est form, its operation must be highly in-  
  
pinous, oy originating new questions tor  
litigation, and of course, subjecting all our I  
commerce to new hazards of interruption. - &#x27;  
We presume not, however, to comprehend !  
to what extent, or in what manner the princi- I  
pic will be applied; we perceive, that the 1  
ancient land-mark has been removed, but we &#x27;  
seek in vain for a beacon to direct our course ; &#x27;  
If we enquire whether a Jide sale and 1  
delivery of Mercltandiie.by an importer, be- &#x27;  
ing a citizen to another known citizen of  
the United States, for a valuable considera­  
tion, will.hsln ordinary esses, be conclusive  
evidence of a transferor property, and the  
answer is affirmative ; then we complain that  
our ships have been detained, the fates of in­  
surance enhanced, and our property confisca­  
ted, for the establishment of a rule; which  
when once understood, will bttomc nugato.  
ry, and cease to produce any commercial or  
political effect. If on the other hand, this  
evidence is not lobe deemed conclmive, we  
profess ourselves to be utterly at a loss to  
disrovrr, what proofs of Vwnership,&quot;and neu-  
trality of property, can with safety, be rtlitd  
on.  
  
I -  
  
But these embarrassments, though perplex  
ing and vexatious, are not those which prin­  
cipally occasion our solicituijs. Wc are  
compelled to consider the late derisions of  
the British tribunals, as preliminary steps to­  
wards a system for controlling the imports­  
4tons and cxportalions of colonial productions,  
thereby annihilating the most lucrative  
branches of our foreign commerce.  
If we owedthis trade solely to thcfavo-ir  
ofGrrat-Biitain ; stilt we might ask, what  
urgent motive, what imperious necessity,  
required that the favour should c resumed,  
at a piwoil when our commerce was spread  
over the ocean, and when a change so essen­  
tial slight destroy its security, and subject  
us to incalculable losses I  
Wc deny, however, that the rights of  
commerce, as claimed by us, are to be deem­  
ed favours; on the contrary, if the Uw of  
nailonsts other than a temporary rule, prescrib­  
ed by an arbitrary will, k enforced by power,  
then we appeal to its most universal and in­  
violable principle, in our defence. This prin

the Old law. If neutral rights can be reduced i  
Within more confined limit than, this law ;  
prescribes, we perceive not ho,&quot; amidst ihe.  
cofliflioua of national interests, any neutral  
commerce can existeveu in our native pro­  
ductions. &quot;  
&quot;If it be intimited, that hetifrats shdlild be  
confined to a commerce with such places,  
and in! such articles only as were allowed in  
peace, by the municipal regulations of the  
countries engaged in war; the doctrine may  
be repelled by the notorious lact, that, no such  
principle has governed the conduct of nations,  
during any wars in which . they Have, been  
engaged j all were fixeto Vary, and In fact  
kllhave varied, their commercial system :  
whatever theoretical opinions may therefore  
have been advanced, there has existed no  
such practical rule, and to set up sucli a rule  
under the unparralleled circumstances of the  
present war, must infallibly destroy, the com­  
merce of this country. &#x27; &#x27; ,&#x27;  
v. It is a well known fact, -that the people of  
the United States export to foreign countries  
a greater pr6portlon of the aggregate annual  
value oLthe products of their industry, than &#x27;  
any other people of the globe-; they arb con-&#x27;  
sejuently most deeply interested in the se­  
curity and freedom of their trade i in short,  
being almost exclusively an agricultural unci  
commercial people, those parts of our coun­  
try) which, from recent settlement, br from  
other circumstances, are wholly agricultural  
are &#x27;more immediately interested than any .  
Other, as they are in a greater degree, depvti-&#x27;  
dent oh foreign supplies, and consequently  
most liable to he affected, by any vibrations  
of the commercial system.  
As our manufactures do not flourish in pro  
portion to the progress of our population,  
wealth end luxury, the necessity of extend­  
ing our cbmmerce is constantly increasing.  
The basis of all our trade is the aggregate  
Value of our native productions, exceeding  
&#x27;whit are consumed in the United States r  
these are exported&#x27; to various countries, from  
which we receive supplies for domestic use,  
or other articles . for exportation. A very  
great proportion of all the results of our  
tommcrce with the world centre in the do-&quot;  
minions of Great&#x27;Britain, and we receive al­  
most exclusively from thatcountry,ourcloathk  
ing, and other necessary iruriul&#x27;nuui-es.  
. By the events of the late and present warj  
many countries with which we prosecuted  
an increasing tiade, have been either diverted  
from manufacturing pursuits, or have been  
greatly impoverished, or conquered and sub­  
jected to the colonial system ofGreat-Britain.  
With these preliminary facts in view, we  
request pel mission to detail some of the most  
important consequences of the assumed rule,  
that neutrals maybe restrained, in time vf vjr,  
  
to their cccustomtd trace in f mr of peace. I lie  
injustice of such a rule,&quot; in relation to the Uni­  
ted States, will be more manifest : the indi­  
viduals eniployed in commerce, would not a­  
lone be affected : all the internal relations of  
our country would be&#x27; disturbed: the inter­  
ests of those districts which are most remote  
from our principal ports, would, in proportion  
to their dependence on foreign supplies, be  
most severely depressed.  
The effects of War cannot be confined to  
the countries engaged in war. The value of  
money ; the price of labour ; the rates of  
  
freight and insurance, arc by war enhancid  
throughout the woild ; all articles of inerch-&#x27;  
.andize,bothof export and import,arc various­  
ly affected, in their quantities and value, by  
new wants ; by the relinquishment of for­  
mer pursuits, and by the new direction which  
is thereby given&#x27; to the industry of different  
nations. . Other consequences result from  
  
the effects of war as the impoverishment of  
some, and the sggratiduemcnt of other coun­  
tries; alsp, from the acknowledged right of  
belligerent nations to interdict commerce in  
contraband articles, and toinsliiute blockades.  
This last right is highly injurious to neutrals  
as it frequenjl restrains them from proceed­  
ing to the best markets. lit i obviously im­  
possible, therefore, to confine the United  
States, in time r f war, amidst all these chan­  
ges and disadvantages, to their actuttomtd  
irwJ in time $J peace wnfout ddlrou tilt  
tn&#x27;.e.  
If in consequence of the war, certain arti­  
cle usually exported from the United States  
to countries from which we received neces­  
sary supplies, cease to be demanded in those  
countries, may wc r.ot esport other ariiiks,  
and thereby l.lilain the supplies we tired t  
&quot; If articles usually imported into the United  
  
, States in lime of peace, rca to be demanded  
  
by tit in lime or war, in consfquence of our

These &quot;We &#x27;hot imaginary Suppositions:  
, they illustrate the most important principles&quot;  
Of our commerce ; they evince the necessity  
Of a Circuitous trade, to enable &#x27;us to leaiizd  
the great. Value of exports in our native pro­  
ductions,&#x27; which 8lon,c we atquiie live pow­

strate, thai&#x27; thfc position against which we  
tonic-rid, is not a rule of the law of nations i  
thelaiv of nations ordains no rule - winch is  
Unequal and unjust.  
But sill we haVe bt&#x27;her and more forcible  
bbiection; the concession which is required  
would deprive. US of many advantages, con­  
nected witV.our local situation, our enter-  
prise, our wealth, and our fortune ; it would  
require usto ltivert much of our capital and  
industry to new employments .it would a­  
mount to an abandonment of views, as a com­  
mercial people, and might involve us in dan­  
gerous .controversies,, by virtual admission,  
that any essential articles of supply may, at  
the pleasure of a belligerent nation. be pla­  
ced in a state of inhibition, equivalent, to be­  
ing declared contraband of war.  
Hitherto we have regarded it as a peculiar  
felicity incident to our neutral situation, that  
-It was equally beneficial to Wrselves, and to  
all the parties with whom we are connected t &#x27;  
the articles exported by us to the enemies or  
Great-Britain, being convenient supplies- &#x27;  
promised to secure to our ships in their pons  
a welcome reception and hospitable treat  
ment. As the direct returns for these ex--ports  
were inconsiderable, and as the pro  
  
ducts were almost exclusively remitted ti  
Greut-Britain, and thereby. applied in pay&#x27;  
ment for manufactures purchased oh ctir ac­  
count, we considered ourselves suit- of re-  
ceiving from them, at least that ilegiee- of  
&quot; protection,which was - recommended &#x27;by a&#x27;  
regard to neutral interests. &#x27;  
It is however with much surprise that, we  
have recently discoveredi that the very cir­  
cumstances upon which our hopes of secur­  
ity are reposed, have been Uicd as at rai­  
ments to justify an invasion of our riglns, and  
st1rat, having totally supprejsed the external  
commerce of her enemies, Grcat-Bt hin It  
now counselled to appropriate to herself that  
of herfritnds. If it be true that.asexpr.rwr  
of certain articles to the ultimate raiket,­  
our interest are in collision with her&#x27;s yet it  
ought to be recollected, that it is a partittlvf  
and minor interest only which st.iTVrs, and  
that the dis; civontnge is. a necessary rrn?c  
quenrc of her colonial hjstcm: that the.  
general results of our commerce are trer-My  
  
j in her fuvor ; that they invijfi rate l.er iiii.-j  
  
niaciuring interests, w inen are the grot t;i.sf  
of her wealth; and that tlicse ititi resls caii  
never be promoted by.thr impovcrishmeiit oV

neutral rights ought not to &#x27;diininish, ttther

In the list of our complaints, we car.:.;.,  
foibear to enumerate the humiliating and ex­  
pressive conduct of ships uf war, in the ti­  
cin&#x27;uy of our coasts and liarbouis. We res­

Zo the President of the United States; and the Sentite and Houle of  
&#x27; Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled : The  
Memorial of the Merchants of the City of New-York. Gy e  
YOUI{ Memorialifts beg leave refpe&amp;fully to approach the Government of  
k. their country, on fubje@ts of great importancé, which have alf:@ed their  
minds with the deepest anxiety and alarm.———Confding in the jullice and  
friie.:ndly dispositions of the Government of Great Britaio, and entertaining. a cora  
relpondent expe&amp;aticn that no unusual reftriftions wouid be imposed on Neutral  
Com{nerce, without adequate motives and the most ample notice presuming  
efpecnally, that commercial enterprizes, commenced under the fin&amp;ion of eflal.  
lithed principles, would on no account be affe&amp;ted by a chunge of fyfem ; your  
~tpcmoriahﬁs have employed a valt capital in importing various colonial nroduce  
tions, the surplus of which, exceeding the demands of this couniry, they have  
been accustomed to export freely to the different markets of Europe.——— As.  
ter this commerce had been prosecuted without reftri@ion for {everal years, and  
hacl attracted a great proportion of their wealth ; after their insurers had aflome  
ed immense responsibilities, grotinded on an opinion, that this trade was firi¢tly  
g&#x27;egular ;.havmg never received the slightest intimation, that it could be deemed  
incompatible with the rights of a belligerent nation, they have been suddenly  
confounded, by unexpeded intel!i%lence of the arreftation on the high seas, of a  
large portion of their property, which had been embarked with the molt unfufl­  
peétmg confidence.———The feelings of your memoralils are not only excited,  
by the losses which they have a@ually sustained, in consequence of a measure un­  
fufceptible of previous calculation, but al{fo from the Rate of uncertainty in which  
they are placed, with refpe&amp; to futuré commercial operations. ——Your me­  
morialifts have heretofore believed, that ¢ommerze between the United States  
and colonies fubjet to the enemies of Great-Britain_, when bena fide prosecuted on  
their own dccount, would be perfedtly fafe from interruption : They have also  
believed that all articles, which might Be securely impsrted into the Ulited States,  
might be as securely experted ; with the exceptions well anderflood, both in re.  
{pect to the import and ezport trade, of commerce with places blockaded, or in  
articles contraband of war.————lln a recent intrepretation of what is consider­  
ed by the tribunals of Great-Britain as a dire&amp;¥¥rade, between the colonies and  
the parent countries ‘of their enemies, your mehg:iﬁs perceive with concern,  
the developement of a prin.cip‘le, which, if concedad on the part of the United  
States, must prove fatal to their commercial importance.  
It is understood to have been decided, that whenever it appears to be the in­  
tention of the importer of colonial produce, to export the fame to Europe ; om  
whenever it is {o exported by the original importer, such intention or exportation,  
shall be evidence of a dire@? trade and fubje&amp;@ the property, though neutral, to  
confifcation. ————Yotur memorialilts confider it their bounden auty to theme  
selves and their country, to express their most decided opposition to this decision.  
~ Asto the evidence arifling from the fappofed ictention of an imiporter, they  
readily admit, that the great quantities of colonial produce, which are acquired  
by means of the American commerce, exceeding the demand for consumption  
in the United States, will fairly jaltify a general presumption, that the surplus i 3  
ultimately deflined for European markets. They aflert, however, that the in.  
tention of &amp; mierchant, in refpe&amp; to the future deflinasion of bis property, mult, from  
the nature of things, be inconclusive. All plans of business, formed by individe  
uals, are }iable to be affected by circum@ances, not to be forefeen or controlled :  
—these plans are therefore neceflarily revokable by those who form them ; and  
an intention which has not been executed, proves nothing more than might jultly  
be inferred from ageneral presumption, arising, from the course of our com­  
merce. To apply such an intention, in a particular case, to the prejudice of an  
individual ; to presume that he has voluntarily incurred an immense risk, which,’  
consistently with the success of his main obje¢t, he might have fairly avoided,  
and to involve him in ruin for prosecuting a trade, which, if undertaken with a  
different motive, would have been declared lawful ;—would be, in the opinicn.  
of your memorialifts, to confound and reverse the best established principles of  
realon, equity, and law.———Your memorialilts contend for no innovations on’  
the law of nations ; and except where {pecial treaties have prescribed &#x27; a  
different rule, they admit that they may lawfully be restrained from tranf­  
poriing the property of the parties engaged in war. In the recent decifion’  
which&#x27; prohibits’ an importer of ‘colonial produce from exporting it to Europe,  
they however perceive with concern, either a nugatory and vexatious regulationy’  
or a 2 meditated blow, at what they deem an iaconteflible and valuable right.  
- Heretofore there existed clear and obvious circumstances of discrimination, be­  
tween the dired? trase, which Great-Britain has aflumed the right of denying to­  
neutrals, and the indire&amp; or circuitous trade, which [he admits to be lawful. The  
direc? trade could be performed by a single shipment or voyage ; whereas, the’  
circuitous trade fubjefed the property to double freight and insurances, to deduc~&#x27;  
tions in favour of the revenue, and to various other expences in this country.  
if&#x27;the arrival of a ship in the country to which it belongs ; the landing of the  
cargo ; the inspection of the Cultom-Houfe ; the payment or security of duties ;  
do&#x27; not #erminate a voyage ; then we confels our ignorance on a point, which,  
never having been before questioned, has been afflumed by us as an acknowledged  
truth. If the entry for exportation } the embarkation of merchandize ; the re­  
infpe&amp;ion of the Cultom-Houfe ; the bond for securing a delivery io a foreign:  
‘country, and abnﬁﬁédearﬂhc‘e, do nat iﬁdiédte&#x27;thc commencement of @ new vage  
age, then we are y¢t to learn the meaning of the expreflion. . If all the formal- .  
ities&#x27;and fan&amp;ions established for the security of cur revenue : if operations of  
immense ‘magnitude, tranfadted with the greatelt publicity, and without any  
motivé for concealment, are considered as uareal representations, and merely  
colorablé and fraudalent contrivances to cover an i/licit trade, between the col­  
onies &amp;0 the parest couttries of the enetuis of Great Britain; then it becomes  
“neceffury, ﬁaeg?igre ard to ourgﬁﬁ:%égei‘sand interelts, to inquire, whether the  
m%r@gnhﬁmsc&amp;gﬁ&amp;amote&amp;eﬁmtg“ criterion for the discovery of truth 2  
&#x27;We&#x27;repel &#x27;with indignation thé&#x27;ﬁgggei}m,that the tran-fhipment of property  
;,fbrsgfﬁr:eigg‘fmtf&quot;&quot;f&quot;f_;, cet, by the ori‘gin | importer, is evidence of fraud or chicane 3  
~or that, unsupported by other circumstances, it can jullify a suspicion, that it&#x27; is  
other than neutral. In our-opinion, any discrimination between the rights of an  
MWW&amp;’ and a vender in ;&amp; t}giggg States, is manifeltly fallacious,  
asft‘ﬂﬂumﬁ*}‘aﬁ&#x27; rts, that thefdrmatcan exercise only an imperfedt dominion

this trade solely 1o the favour of Great:Britain ; fill we might alk, what ur­

than a temporary rule, prescribed by ‘an arbitrary will, and enforced by power,

Nevrrar CountriEs, and ports of @ Bericerent CounNTRY 207 INVESTED o 7  
Brockanedy are proteiled. ———lln the controversies which have existed at dis:  
fereat times, for extending the privileges of neutral veflels, and limiting the  
grounds of eapture, we take no part &#x27;we appeal to the old law. Ifaneutral  
rights can be reduced within more confined limits than this law prescribes, we  
perceive not how, amidst the collisions of national interefls, any neutral com- %  
~ Merce can exilt, even in our native productions.—-——llf it be intimated, that  
nentrals thould be eonfined to a commerce with such places and in such articles &#x27;  
only, as were allowed in peace, by the municipal legulations of the countricsens 1  
gaged in war ; the doctrine may be repelled by the notorious fad, that no such  
principle has governed the condu&amp; of nations, during any wars in which they  
have been engaged ; all were free to vary, and all in fa&amp; have varied, their  
commercial {yitems : whatever theoretical opinions may therefore have been ad­  
vanced, there has existed no such pra&amp;ical rule, and to set up sock a rule, under  
the unparalleled circumßtances of the present war, must infallibly destroy the.  
commerce of this country.————Tlt is a well known fa@&amp;, that the people of the  
United States export to foreign countries a greater proportion of the aggregate  
annual value of the produés of their industry, than any other people of the  
globe ; they are consequently most deeply interested in the security and freedom  
~of their trade : in short, being almofl exclusively an agricultural and commer­  
cial people, those parts of our country, which from recent settlement, or from  
other circumstances are wholly agricultaral, are more immediately interested  
than any other, as they are in a greater degree dependent, on foreign supplies,  
and consequently most liable to be affected, by any vibrations of the commercial  
{ytem.———As our manufa&amp;ures do not flourifh in proportion to the progress  
of our population, weaith, and luxury, the neceflity of extending our commerce:  
is constantly increasing.———The basis of all our trade is the aggregate value of  
our native productions, exceeding what are consumed in the United States :  
these are exported to various countries, from which we receive {upplies for do­  
meltic use, or other articles for exportation. A very great proportion of all the  
results of our commetce with the world, centre in the dominions of Great-Bri­  
tain, and we receive almost exclusively from that country, our cloathing, and oth­  
er neceflary manufa@tures.———Dßy the events of the late and present war, ma­  
ny couniries with which we prosecuted an increasing trade, have been either di­  
verted from manufa&amp;uring pursuits, or have been greatly impoverithed, or con­  
quered and {ubje@ed to the colonial system of Great Britain. e i  
With thele preliminary faéts in view, we requelt permission to detail some  
of the most important consequences of the assumed rule, that neutrals may be re-  
Jirained, in time of war, to their accuflomed trade in time of peace. &#x27;The injustice of  
such a rule, in relation to the United States, will be more manifet : the individ­  
vals employed in cemmerce, would not alone be affected ; all the internal rela­  
tions of our country wonld bé diflurbed : the interests of those diftri@s which  
are most remote from our principle ports, would, in proportion to their depen­  
dence on foreign supplies, be most severely depressed.———The effe@s of war  
cannot be confined to the countries engaged in war. The value of money ;3 the  
price of labour ; the rates of freight and insurance, are by war enhanced through­  
out the world : all articles of merchandize, both of export and impdrt, are vari­  
ously affeced, in their quantities and value, by new wants ; by the relinquish  
ment of former pursuits, and by the new direion which is thereby given, to the  
industry of different nations. Other consequences result from the effes of war 3  
as the impoverishment of some, and the aggrandizement of other countries : al­  
so, from the acknowledged right of belligerent na*ions to interdi&amp; commerce in  
contrabaud articles, and to inltitute blockades. This last right is highly injuri­  
ous to neutrals, as it frequently restrains them from proceeding to the best mar­  
‘kets.—lt is obviously impoflible, therefore, to confine the United States, in time  
of war, amidß all these changes and disadvantages, to their accuflomed. trade in time  
of peacey without defiroying all trade.———-If, in. canfequence of the war, certain  
articles usually exported from the United States to countries from which we re­  
ceived necessary supplies, cease to be demanded in those countries, may we not  
‘export other articles, and thereby obtain the supplies we need 2  
If articles usually imported into the United States in time of peace, cease to  
be demanded by us in time of war, in consequence of our ability to obtain fub­  
~ ftitutes which we prefer, shall we be required to renounce our export trade,by being  
- ferbid to import uther articles for consumption or for commerce !or shall we  
be compelled to receive in excharige, articles which we do not require ? .  
If, m eonfequence of an increased demand for eur exports to particnlar cotn­  
- tries, we ebtain in exchange, articles of commerce exceeding our domeltic wants,  
shall it be required that the surplus perith on our hands ?———llf Great Britain.,  
- permits commerce between her subjects and the colonies of her ¢nemies, may we  
~-not, with the consent of those colonies, participate in the fame commerce 2  
~ If our commeree with the enemies of Great Britain may now be confined to the  
-~ fyftemreftablifhed in time of peace, may wemot apprehend that the principle will be  
. vetaliated, in relpe&amp; so our commerce with the coloaies.of Great Britain 2ln that  
~ cale, what can ensue but war, pillage, and devastation :——~Thefe are not imagi­  
- inaryfuppofitions ; they Hluftrate the most important principles of our commerce ;  
- they evince the neceflity of a citcuitous trade, to cenable us so realize the great  
~ value of exports im our native produ@ions, by which alone we acquire the pow­  
“‘er to liquidate’ the balance against us, in our commerce with Great Brizain :  
. they demonstrate, that the position againß which we contend, is.not a rule of  
. the law of nations : the law of nations or‘d-&amp;in’g no rule which is unegual and un-;  
jult.———But Rill we have other and more forcible objeétions :. the conceflion  
~ which is required, would deprive us of many advantages, conneted with our 10--  
cal situation, our enterprise, our wealth, and our fortune ; it would require us  
to divert much of our’ capital and industry to new employments ; it would a- .

_ hibition, equivalent to being declared contraband of war,—=—-«Hitherio we  
have regarded it as a peculiar felicity incident to our neutral situation, that it  
- was equally beneficial to ourselves, and to all the patties mthﬁhammareem

individuall thits gudty to be otir ene.  
mies;, andiwe wilh not 10 screen them  
from the jaft consequences of their  
mifcondud We also atfert, that a  
comprehensive view of our commerce,  
affords conglufive evidence, that of the  
the propotjion which can poflibly be­  
long to the enemies of Great Britaia,  
is 20 obje@unworthy the attention of  
a great power ; elpecially, if in a rigo­  
rous pursuit of its ftri&amp; rights, it in.  
curs’ the harard of forfeiting the es­  
teem of its friends.  
If, therefore, the mode in which ths,  
American commerce is prosecuted, is  
allowed by, the law of nations ; if irre­  
fragable evidence arises from our situ­  
ation, wantj, and neceflary connexions  
with the r‘ei of the world, that it is al­  
most exclusively grounded on Ameri­  
can capitalj if the fuggeßions, “that  
we are the mere agénts of foreigners,  
are ungenerous insults, contrived as a­  
pdlogies for.ﬁnjuﬁes ; if frauds in re­  
latich to foreign trusts, are not more  
frequent in this country than in Great  
‘Britain ; and if no government is able  
wholly to |prevent them ; then our  
conclusion jn the present, as in all oth­  
er cases, ogght to be deduced fiom  
general fa@s, and not from particular  
exceptions. This conclusion is, that  
the American commerce is one of the  
‘great links which conneé those inter­  
ests of civilized nations, which wars  
ought not to dilturb :—that to break  
this link, will be to destroy all com­  
merce 3 and therefore, that a ferions  
mifunderftandinng with Great Britain  
would prove fatal to the most impor­  
tant interefls of both countries.  
- This view of the fubje&amp;, while it ex­  
cites our ansiety, furnifhes also a re­  
{ource for our hopes. ‘We wish only  
for justice : and believing that a com­  
mercial nation which disregards jus­  
tice, thereby undermines the citadel of  
her power, weé rely on the effe&amp; of  
mutual interests and withes in promot­  
ing a cordial explanation, and fair ad­  
jultment of every cause of misunder­  
standing : in particulat, we rely on  
the government of our country, that  
our rights will not be abandened, and  
that no argument i favour of an u­  
surpation will evér be derived from our  
acquiescence. ‘ e  
If our personal interests and local  
attachments have not greatly mil-di­  
reed our opinions, the defencelefs sit­  
uation of the port of New. York, ought  
to excite the auxious solicitude of eve­  
ry friead of his country. Oaur river  
is the only ¢ommercial avenue to a  
fertile and populous country, which is  
rapidly rising into.dmportance. = It is  
here, that oze third of the revenue of  
the Union is collefted ; and this pro­  
portion is underflood to be relatively  
increasing. But while we are gratful  
for these diftinguilhed advantages. of  
mature, our fatisfa&amp;tion is diminished,  
by refle@ing on&#x27; their insecurity ; for  
in proportion as the resources of our  
country accumulate to this point, is the  
hazard, thatthey may present a temp­  
tation to Fapacity, and become the  
prizeof violence. Withoutrecurring to  
‘the experienceof past times for proofs,  
‘that no nation ¢an long maintain an

The conkanéy and valout of the sea­  
men of the United States, are jultly  
themes of patrietic exultation. From  
their connexion with us, we confider  
their cause as our cause, their rights  
as our rights, and their jnlerefts as our  
interests ;. our feelings are indignant  
at the recital of their wrongs ; and  
we requelt, in addition to the protec­  
tion of a naval force, that, at least in  
the American seas, our brave country­  
en, may be permitied to display  
their energy in their own defence,  
Your memorialifts conclude with res  
marking that they deem the present  
situation of public affairs to be pecu­  
liarly critical and perilous, and such  
as requires all the prudence, the wifs  
dom, and energy of government, sup­  
ported by the co.operation of all good  
citizens. By mutual exertions, under  
the benign influence of Providence,  
upon this hitherto favored nation, we  
hope the clouds which threaten to ob­  
fcure&#x27;its prosperity may be dispelled ;  
and we pledge our united support in

To the President of the United

YOUR memorialists beg leave re-

ment of their country, on subjects of  
  
at importance, which have af-  
ected their minds with the deepest  
anxiety and alarm.  
  
Confiding in the justice and friend-

Great Britain, and entertaining 2  
correspondent expectation that no  
unusual restrictions would be im-  
posed on neutral commerce, without  
adequate motives and the most am-  
ple notice; presuming, especially,  
that commercial enterprises, com-

count be affected by a change of

vystem ; your memorialists have  
employed a vast capital in import-  
ing various colonial productions, the  
surplus of which, exceeding the de-  
mands of this country, they have  
been accustomed to export freely to  
the different markets of Europe.  
  
After this commerce had been  
prosecuted without restriction, for  
several years, and had attracted a  
great proportion of their wealth;  
after their insurers had assumed  
immense responsibilities, grounded  
on an opinion that this trade was  
strictly regular; having never re-  
ceived the slightest intimation, that  
it could be deemed incompatible  
with the rights of a belligerent na-  
tion, they have been suddenly con-  
founded, by unexpected intelligence  
of the arrestation, on the high seas,  
of a large portion of their property,  
which had been embarked with the  
most unsuspecting confidence.  
  
The feelings of your memorialists  
are not only excited by the losses  
which they have actually sustained,  
in consequence of a measure unsus-  
ceptible of previous calculation, but  
also from the state of uncertainty in  
which they are placed with respect  
to future commercial operations.  
  
Your memorialists have hereto-  
  
fore believed, that commerce be-  
tween the United States and colo-  
nies subject to the enemies of Great  
Britain, when bcna fide prosecuted  
on their own account, would be per-  
fectly safe from interruption: they  
have also believed, that all articles,  
which might be securely imported  
into the United States, might be as  
securely exported; with the excep-  
tion well understood, both in respect  
to the import and export trade, of  
commerce with places blockaded,  
or in articles contraband of war.  
_ Ina recent interpretation of what  
is considered by the tribunals of  
Great Britain as a direct trade be-  
tween the colonies and the parent  
countries of their enemies, your me-  
morialists perceive, with concern,  
the developement of a principle,  
which, if conceded on the part of  
the United States, must prove fatal  
to their commercial importance,  
  
VOL. Vv. NO, XXIx,  
  
It is understood to have been de-  
cided, that whenever it appears to  
be the intention of the importer of  
colonial produce to export the same  
to Europe, or whenever it is so ex-  
ported by the original importer,  
such intention or exportation shall  
be evidence of a direct trade, and  
subject the property, though neutral,  
to confiscation.  
  
Your memorialists consider it  
their bounden duty to themselves  
and their country, to express their  
most decided opposition to this de-  
cision.  
  
As to the evidence arising from  
the supposed intention of an import-  
er, they readily admit, that the great  
quantities of colonial produce which  
are acquired by means of the Ame-  
rican commerce, exceeding the de-  
mand for consumption in the United  
States, will fairly justify a general  
fresumfition that the surplus is ulti-  
mately destined for European mar-  
kets. They assert, however, that  
the intention of a merchant, in re-  
spect to the future destination of  
his profierty, must, from the nature  
of things, be inconclusive. All plans  
of business, formed by individuals,  
are liable to be affected by circum-  
stances, not to be foreseen or con-  
trolled. These plans are, therefore,  
necessarily revokeable by those who  
form them ; and an intention, which  
has not been executed, proves no-  
thing more than might justly be in-  
ferred from a general presumption,  
arising from the course of our com-  
merce. To apply such an intention  
in a particular case, to the preju-  
dice of an individual; to presume  
that he has voluntarily incurred an  
immense risk, which, consistently  
with the success of his main object,  
he might have fairly avoided, and  
to involve him in ruin for prosecut-  
ing a trade which, if undertaken  
with a different motive, would have  
been declared lawful; would be, in  
the opinion of your memorialists,  
to confound and reverse the best es-  
tablished principles of reason, equi-  
ty, and law.  
  
Your memorialists contend for no  
innovations on the law of nations ;

and, except where special treaties  
have prescribed a different rule,  
they admit that they may lawfully  
be restrained from transporting the  
property of the parties engaged in  
war. In the recent decision, which  
prohibits an importer of colonial  
produce from exporting it to Eu-  
rope, they, however, perceive with  
concern, either a nugatory and vex-  
atious regulation, of a meditated  
blow at what they deem an incon-  
testible and valuable right.  
  
Heretofore there existed clear and  
obvious circumstances of discrimi-  
nation between the direct trade,  
which Great Britain has assumed  
the right of denying to neutrals, and  
the indirect or circuitous trade,  
which she admits to be lawful. The  
direct trade could be performed by  
a single shipment or voyage ; where-  
as the circuitous trade subjected the  
property to double freights and in-  
surances, to deductions in favour of  
the revenue, and various other ex-  
  
nces in this country.  
  
If the arrival of a ship in the  
country to which it belongs, the  
landing of the cargo, the inspection  
of the custom-house, the payment  
or security of duties, do not termi-  
nate a voyage, then we confess our  
ignorance on a point which, never  
having been before questioned, has  
been assumed by us as an acknow-  
ledged truth. If the entry for ex-  
portation, the embarkation of mer-  
chandize, the reinspection of the  
custom-house, the bond for securing  
a delivery in a foreign country, and  
a public cearance, do not indicate  
the commencement of a new voyage,  
then we are yet to learn the mean-  
ing of the expression. If all the for-  
malities and sanctions established for  
the security of our revenue; if ope-  
rations of immense magnitude,  
transacted with the greatest publi-  
city, and without any motive for  
concealment, are considered as un-  
real representations, and merely co-  
lourable and fraudulent contrivan-  
ces to cover an illicit trade between  
the colonies and the parent coun-  
tries of the enemies of Great Britain ;  
tfren it becomes necessary, both in  
  
regard to our characters and inter-  
ests, to enquire whether the new re-  
gulations establish a more definite  
criterion for the discovery of truth.  
  
We repel with indignation the  
suggestion, that the trans-shipment  
of property for a foreign market, by  
the original importer, is evidence of  
fraud or chicane; or that, unsup-  
ported by other circumstances, it  
can justify a suspicion that it is other  
than neutral. In our opinion, any  
discrimination between the rights of  
an importing merchant and a ven-  
dee in the United States is mani-  
festly fallacious, as it virtually as-  
serts that the former can exercise  
only an imperfect dominion over  
property lawfully acquired, and pos-  
sessed in this country, while, at the  
same time, he can convey to the lat-  
ter a title to a privilege not enjoyed  
by himself: in short, that a trade is  
unlawful, when the advantage is to  
result to one person, but may be ren-  
dered lawful, by being participated  
with another.  
  
If the new doctrine is executed in  
the mildest form, its operation must  
be highly injurious, by originating.  
new questions for litigation, and, of  
course, subjecting all our commerce  
to new hazards of interruption. We  
presume not, however, to compre-  
hend to what extent, or in what  
manner, the principle will be ap-  
plied: we perceive that the ancient  
land-mark has been removed, but  
we seek in vain for a beacon to di-  
rect our course. If we enquire whe-  
ther a dona fide sale and delivery of  
merchandize, by an importer, being  
a citizen, to another known citizen  
of the United States, for a valuable  
consideration, will, as in ordinary  
cases, be conclusive evidence of a  
transfer of property, and the answer  
is affirmative; then we complain  
that our ships have been detained,  
the rates of insurance enhanced, ard  
our property confiscated, for the es-  
tablishment of a rule, which, when  
once understood, will become nuga-  
tory, and cease to produce any com-  
mercial or political effect. If, on the  
other hand, this evidence is not to  
be deemed conclusive, we profess

ourselves to be utterly at a loss to  
discover what proofs of ownership  
and neutrality of property can, with  
safety, be relied on.  
  
But these embarrassments, though  
perplexing and vexatious, are not  
those which principally occasion our  
solicitude. We are compelled to  
consider the late decisions of the  
British tribunals as preliminary  
steps towards a system for control-  
ling the importations and exporta-  
tions of colonial productions, and  
thereby annihilating the most lucra-  
tive branches of our foreign com-  
merce.  
  
if we owed this trade solely to the  
favour of Great Britain, still we  
might ask, what urgent motive, what  
imperious necessity, required that  
the favour should be rescinded, at a  
period when our commerce was  
spread over the ocean, and when a  
change so essential might destroy  
its security, and subject us to incal-  
culable losses ?  
  
We deny, however, that the rights  
of commerce, as claimed by us, are  
to be deemed favours; on the con-  
trary, if the law of nations is other  
than a temporary rule, prescribed  
by an arbitrary will, and enforced  
by power, then we appeal to its most  
universal and inviolable principle,  
in our defence. This principle is,  
that the goods of a neutral, consist-  
  
ing of articles not contraband of  
  
war, in a neutral vessel, employed  
in a direct trade between neutral  
countries and fiorts of a belligerent  
country, not invested or blockaded,  
are frrotected,  
  
In the controversies which have  
existed at different times, for ex-  
tending the privileges of neutral  
vessels, and limiting the grounds of  
capture, we take no part; we appeal  
to the old law. If neutral rights can  
be reduced within more confined  
limits than this law prescribes, we  
perceive not how, amidst the colli-  
sions of national interests, any neu-  
tral commerce can exist, even in  
our native productions.  
  
If it be intimated, that neutrals  
should be confined to a commerce  
with such places, and in such a

ticles only as were allowed in peace,  
by the municipal regulations of the  
countries engaged in war, the doc-  
trine may be repelled by the no-  
torious fact, that no such principle  
has governed the conduct of nations,  
during any wars in which they have  
been engaged ; all were free to va-  
ry, and all, in fact, have varied,  
their commercial systems : whate-  
ver theoretical opinions may there-  
fore have been advanced, there has  
existed no such practical rule, and  
to set up such a rule, under the un-  
paralelled circumstances of the pre-  
sent war, must infallibly destroy the  
commerce of this country.  
  
It is a well known fact, that the  
people of the United States export to  
foreign countries a greater propor-  
tion of the aggregate annual value  
of the products of their industry  
than any other people of the globe ;  
they are consequently most deeply  
interested in the security and free-  
dom of their trade; in short, being  
almost exclusively an agricultural  
and commercial people, those parts  
of our country which, from recent  
settlement, or from other circum-  
stances, are whajly agricultural, are  
more immediately interested than  
any other, as they are in a greater  
degree dependent on foreign sup-  
plies, and consequently most liable  
to be affected by any vibrations of  
the commercial system.  
  
As our manufactures do not flou-  
rish in proportion to the progress of  
our population, wealth, and luxury,  
the necessity of extending our com-  
merce is constantly increasing.  
  
The basis of all our trade is the  
aggregate value of our native pro-  
ductions, exceeding what are con-  
sumed in the United States: these  
are exported to various countries,  
from which we receive supplies for  
domestic use, or other articles for  
exportation. A very great propor-  
tion of all the results of our com-  
merce with the world centre in the  
dominions of Great Britain, and we  
receive almost exclusively from that  
country our cloathing and other ne-  
cessary manufactures.

sent war, many countries with which  
we prosecuted an increasing trade,  
have been either diverted from ma-  
nufacturing pursuits, or have been  
greatly impoverished, or conquered  
and subjected to the colonial system  
of Great Britain.  
  
With these preliminary facts in  
view, we request permission to de-  
tail some of the most important con-  
sequences of the assumed rule, that  
neutrals may be restrained, in time  
of war, to their accustomed trade in  
time of feace. The injustice of such  
a rule, in relation to the United  
States, will be more manifest: the  
individuals employed in commerce  
would not alone be affected ; all the  
internal relations of our country  
would be disturbed ; the interests of  
those districts which are most re-  
mote from our principal ports would,  
in proportion to their dependence on  
foreign supplies, be most severely  
depressed.  
  
The effects of war cannot be con-  
fined to the countries engaged in  
war. The value of money, the  
price of labour, the rates of freight  
and insurance, are by war enhanced  
throughout the world ; all articles of  
merchandize, both of export and im-  
port, are variously affected, in their  
gualities and value, by new wants,  
by the relinquishment of former pur-  
suits, and by the new direction which  
is thereby given to the industry of  
different nations. Other consequen-  
ces result from the effects of war:  
as the impoverishment of some, and  
the aggrandizement of other coun-  
tries ; also from the acknowledged  
right of beliigerent nations to inter-  
dict commerce in contraband arti-  
cles, and to institute blockades,  
This last right is highly injurious to  
neutrals, as it frequently restrains  
them from praceeding to the best  
markets, It is obviously impossible,  
therefore, to confine the United  
States, in time of war, amidst all  
these changes and disadvantages, to  
their accustoméd trade in time of  
peace, without destroying all trade.  
  
If, in consequence of the war, cer-  
tain articles usually exported from  
the United States, to countries from  
  
which we received necessary sup-  
plies, cease to be demanded in those  
countries, may we not export other  
articles, and thereby obtain the sup-  
plies we need ?  
  
If articles, usually imported into  
the United States in time of peace,  
cease to be demanded by us in time  
of war, in consequence of our ability  
to obtain substitutes which we pre-  
fer, shall we be required to renounce  
our export trade, by being forbid to  
import other articles for consump-  
tion or for commerce? or shall we  
be compelled to receive in exchange  
articles which we do not require ‘  
  
If, in consequence of an increased  
demand for our exports to particu.  
lar countries, we obtain, in ex-  
change, articles of commerce ex-  
ceeding our domestic wants, shall it  
be required that the surplus perish  
on our hands ?  
  
If Great Britain permits com-  
merce between her subjects and the  
colonies of her enemies, may we  
not, with the consent of those colo-  
nies, participate in the same com-  
merce ?  
  
If our commerce with the ene-  
mies of Great Britain may now be  
confined to the system established in  
time of peace, may we not appre-  
hend that the principle will be re-  
taliated, in respect to our commerce  
with the colonies of Great Britain ?  
In that case, what can ensue but  
war, pillage, and devastation ?  
  
These are not imaginary supposi-  
tions; they illustrate the most im-  
portant principles of our commerce ;  
they evince the necessity of a cir-  
cuitous trade, to enable us to realize  
the great value of exports in our  
native productions, by which alone  
we acquire the power to liquidate  
the balance against us, in our com-  
merce with Great Britain: they  
demonstrate that the position against  
which we contend is not a rule of  
the law of nations: the law of na-  
tions ordains no rulg which is une-  
gual and unjust.  
  
But still we have other and more  
forcible objections: the concession  
which is required would deprive us  
of many advantages, connected with

éur local situation, our enterprize,  
our wealth, and our fortune; it  
would require us to divert much of  
our capital and industry to new em-  
ployments; it would amount to an  
abandonment of views, as a com-  
mercial people, and might involve  
us in dangerous controversies, by  
virtual admission, that any essential  
articles of supply may, at the plea-  
sure of a belligerent nation, be pla-  
ced in a state of inhibition, equiva-  
lent to bejng declared contraband  
of war.  
  
Hitherto we have regarded it as  
a peculiar felicity incident to our  
neutral situation, that it was equally  
beneficial to ourselves, and to all  
the parties with whom we are con-  
nected: the articles exported by us  
to the enemies of Great Britain, be-  
ing convenient supplies, promised to  
secure to our ships in their ports a  
welcome reception and hospitable  
treatment. As the direct returns  
for these exports were inconsidera-  
ble, and as the products were almost  
exclusively remitted to Great Bri-  
tain, and thereby applied in payment  
for manufactures purchased on our  
account, we considered ourselves  
sure of receiving from them, at  
least, that degree of protection  
which was recommended by a re-  
gard to mutual interests,  
  
It is, however, with much sur-  
prise that we have recently disco-  
vered, that the very circumstances  
upon which our hopes of security  
were reposed, have been urged as  
arguments to justify an invasion of  
our rights, and that, having totally  
suppressed the external commerce of  
her enemies, Great Britain is now  
counselled to appropriate to herself  
that of her friends. If it be true  
that, as exporters of certain articles  
to the ultimate markets, our inte-  
rests are in collision with hers; yet  
it ought to be recollected, that it is  
a particular and minor interest only  
which suffers, and that the disad-  
vantage is a necessary consequence  
of her colonial system ; that the ge-  
neral results of our commerce are  
greatly in her favour ; that they in-  
vigorate her manufacturing inte

rests, which are the great basis of  
her wealth ; and that these interests  
can never be promoted by the im-  
poverishment of her best customers,  
Surely the security of neutral rights  
ought not to diminish as their value  
is augmented; surely a maritime  
preponderancy, which enables its  
possessor to blockade any of the  
ports of its enemies, conveys no just  
title to a monopoly of the commerce  
of the world !  
  
In the list of our complaints we  
cannot forbear to enumerate the hu-  
miliating and oppressive conduct of  
ships of war, in the vicinity of our  
coasts and harbours. We respect  
the principle, and emulate the con-  
duct of Great Britain, in regard to  
her own jurisdiction, and we wish  
merely to claim for ourselves the  
same measure of justice which she  
exacts from others.  
  
But while we contend that we  
ought not to be exposed to humiliat-  
ing inquisitions in the verge of our  
port, which, by means of secret con-  
nections with our city, may be ren-  
dered conducive to the indulgence  
of partiality, favour, or malice, we  
disavow every wish to divest the  
belligerent nations of their rights,  
If, in particular instances, the Ame-  
rican flag, and the character of an  
American merchant, have been  
prostituted to unworthy purposes,  
we declare the individuals thus  
guilty to be our enemies, and we  
wish not to screen them from ‘the  
just consequences of their miscon-  
duct. We also assert, that a com-  
prehensive view of our commerce  
affords conclusive evidence, that the  
proportion which can possibly be-  
long to the enemies of Great Britain  
is an object unworthy the attention  
of a great power, especially if, in a  
rigorous pursuit of its strict rights,  
it incurs the hazard of forfeiting the  
esteem of its friends.  
  
If, therefore, the mode in which  
the American commerce is pro-  
secuted is allowed by the law of  
nations; if irrefragable evidence  
arises from our situation, wants, and  
necessary connections with the rest  
of the world, that it is almost exclu

sively grounded on American capi-  
tal; if the suggestions that we are  
the mere agents of foreigners are  
ungenerous insults, contrived as apo-  
logies for injuries; if frauds in re-  
jation to foreign trusts are not more  
frequent in this country than in  
Great Britain; and if no govern-  
ment is able wholly to prevent  
them; then our conclusion in the  
present, as in all other cases, ought  
to be deduced from general facts,  
and not from particular exceptions.  
This conclusion is, that the Ameri-  
can commerce is one of the great  
links which confiect these interests  
of civilized nations, which wars  
ought not to disturb ; that to break  
this link will be to destroy all com-  
merce ; and, therefore, that a seri-  
ous misunderstanding with Great  
Britain would prove fatal to the  
most important interests of both  
countries.  
  
This view of the subject, while it  
excites our anxiety, furnishes also a  
resource for our hopes. We wish  
only for justice ; and believing that  
a commercial nation, which disre-  
gards justice, thereby undermines  
the citadel of her power, we rely on  
the effect of mutual interests and  
wishes in promoting a cordial ex-  
planation and fair adjustment of  
every cause of misunderstanding :  
in particular, we rely on the go-  
vernment of our country, that our  
rights will not be abandoned, and  
that no argument in favour of a  
usurpation will ever be derived from  
our acquiescence,  
  
If our personal interests and local  
  
ttachments have not greatly misdi-  
rected our opinions, the detenceless  
situation of the port of New York  
ought to excite the anxious solicitude  
ot every friend of his country. Our  
river is the only commercial avenue  
to a fertile and populous country,  
which is rapidly rising into import-  
ance. It is here that one third of  
the revenue of the union iscollected ;  
and this preportion is understood to  
be relatively increasing. But while  
we are grateful for these distin-  
guished advantages of nature, our  
satisfaction is diminished by reflect-

ing on their insecurity ; for in pra-  
portion as the resources of the coun-  
try accumulate to this point, is the  
hazard, that they may present a  
temptation to rapacity, and become  
the prize of violence. Without re-  
curring to. the experience of past  
times for proofs that no nation can  
long maintain an extensive com-  
merce, without well ‘defended sea  
ports, and an efficient military ma-  
rine, we are admonished by the new  
and portentous aspectYof Europe,  
and the alarming prevalence of pi-  
racy in the West Indies, that ener-  
getic measures of defence have be-  
come indispensably necessary.  
  
We presume not to express any  
opinion respecting the degree of  
force, of which the permanent navy  
ought to consist ; and being sensible  
thatdelays must attend the construc-  
tion of suitable defences for our  
port, we shall rest satigfied when  
we perceive that these measures  
are commenced, in a manner and  
upon a scale which will assure to us  
an efficient completion.  
  
Such, however, is the present or-  
ganized force of the United States,  
tuat we should consider it inconsis-  
tent with the honour, interests, or  
security of our country, to parley  
with the pirates of the West Indies,  
whose conduct being inconsistent  
with any known rules of lawful war-  
fare, cannot have been authorized  
by any civilized nation towards ano-  
ther nation, in a state of peace.  
Our vessels, while pursuing a law-  
ful trade, have been piratically  
seized, their cargoes have been  
forcibly taken away and distributed,  
without even the form of a trial;  
the vessels in many instances sunk  
and destroyed, and the crews strip-  
ped of all their property: all these  
outrages have been exercised upon  
innocent and .defenceless men, ag-  
gravated by unprecedented circum-  
stances of insult, oppression, and  
barbarity. Some of these violences  
have been committed on vessels  
which were captured within sight  
of our harbours; and the great scene  
of these unparalleled enormities is

the only avenue by which we pre-  
  
serve a commercial connection with  
  
our brethren of the western states :  
  
a connection which we cherish with  
  
ardour, aS a source of mutual ad-  
  
vantage, and a bond of permanent  
union.  
  
But it is not on account of our pe-  
cuniary losses alone that we com-  
plain. The constancy and valour  
of the seamen of the United States  
are justly themes of patriotic exul-  
tation. From their connection with  
us, we consider their cause as our  
cause, their rights as our rights,  
and their interests as our interests ;  
our feelings are indignant at the re-  
cital of their wrongs; and we re-  
quest, in addition to the protection  
of a naval force, that, at least in the  
American seas, our brave country-  
men may be permitted to display  
their energy in their own defence.  
  
Your memorialists conclude with  
remarking, that they deem the pre-  
sent situation of public affairs to be  
peculiarly critical and perilous, and  
such as requires all the prudence,  
the wisdom, and energy of govern-  
ment, supported by the co-operation  
of all good citizens. By mutual ex-  
ertions, under the benign influence  
of Providence upon this hitherto fa-  
voured nation, we hope the clouds  
that threaten to obscure its prospe-  
rity may be dispelled; and we  
pledge our united support in favour  
of all measures adopted to vindicate  
and secure the just rights of our  
country.  
  
Signed by the unanimous order, and
