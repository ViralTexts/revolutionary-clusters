[New York, June 26, 1804]  
Sir  
  
The letter which you yesterday delivered me and your subsequent communications, in Col Burrs opinion evince no disposition on the part of Genl Hamilton to come to a satisfactory accomodation. The injury complained of and the reparation expected are so definitely expressed in Col: Burr’s letter of the 21st Instant, that there is not perceived a necessity for further explanation on his part. The difficulty that would result from confining the enquiry to any particular times and occasions must be manifest. The denial of a specified conversation only, would leave strong implications that on other occasions improper language had been used. When and where injurious opinions and expressions have been uttered by Genl Hamilton must be best known to him and of him only will Col: Burr enquire. No denial or declaration will be satisfactory unless it be general, so as wholly to exclude the idea that rumors derogatory to Col: Burr’s honor have originated with Genl Hamilton as have been fairly inferred from any thing he has said. A definite reply to a requisition of this nature was demanded by Col: Burrs letter of the 21 Inst. This being refused invites the alternative alluded to in Genl Hamilton’s letter of the 20th. It was required by the position in which the controversy was placed by Genl Hamilton on friday last and I was immediately furnished with a communication demanding a personal interview. The necessity of this measure has not in the opinion of Col. Burr been diminished by the General’s last letter or any communication which has since been received.  
I am consequently again instructed to deliver you a message as soon as it may be convenient for you to receive it. I beg therefore you will be so good as to inform me at what hour I can have the pleasure of seeing you.  
Your Most obt &amp; very hm Sert

On the 26lhofJune, Mr. j re­  
ceived the following letter :  
no. 8.  
Sir,  
The letter which you yesterday  
delivered me, and your subsequent  
communication, in Coi. Burr&#x27;s opi­  
nion, evince no disposition, on the  
part of Gen. Hamilton to comedo a  
satisfactory accommodation. The  
injury complained of, and the repara­  
tion expected, are se definitely ex-  
pressed in Col. Burr&#x27;s letter of the  
21st inst. that there is not perceived  
a necessity for further explanation on  
his part. The difficulty that would  
result from confining the enquiry to  
any particular times and occasions,  
must be manifest. The denial of a  
specified conversation only, would  
leave Strang implications that on other  
occasions improper language had  
been used. When and where inju­  
rious opinions and expressions httye  
been uttered by Gen. Hamilton must  
be best known to him, and of him  
only will Col. Burr enquirje. No de­  
nial or &#x27;declaration will be satisfactory  
uiilcss&#x27;it be general, so as wholly to  
exclude the idea that rumours dero­  
gatory to Col. Burr&#x27;s honor have ori­  
ginated with Gen. Hamilton, or have  
been fairly inferred from any thing  
he has said. A definite reply to u  
requisition ef this nature was de  
manded by Col. Burr&#x27;s letter5 of the  
21st inst. This being refused, in­  
vites the alternative alluded to in  
Gen. Hamilton&#x27;s letter of the 20th.  
It wa3 required by the position iu  
which the controversy was placed by  
Gen. Hamilton on Friday last, and I  
was immediately furnished with a  
communication demanclmga personal  
interview. Ihc necessity of this  
measure has not, in the opinion, of  
Col. Burr, been diminished by the  
Cenerars last letter, or any commu­  
nication which has since been re­  
ceived. I am conseauentlv aeraiu in-  
structed to deliver you a message,, as  
soon as it may be convenient for you  
to receive it. I be? therefore vou  
will be so good as to inform me at  
what hour I can have the pleasure  
ot seeing you.
