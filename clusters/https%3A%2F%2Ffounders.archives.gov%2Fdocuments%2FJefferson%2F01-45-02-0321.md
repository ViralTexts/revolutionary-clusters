within twelve months of his re-election to the  
Presidency :—  
  
“Dear Sir,— .... My opinion originally was,  
that the President of the United States should  
have been elected for seven years, and for ever  
ineligible afterwards. I have since become sen-  
sible that seven years is too long to be irremovable,  
and there should be a peaceable way of withdraw-  
ing a man in midways who is doing wrong. The  
service for eight years, with a power to remove at  
the end of the first four, comes nearly to my expe-  
rience; and it is in adherence to that that I deter-  
mine to withdraw at the end of my second term.  
The danger is, that the indulgence and attachment  
of the people will keep a man in after he becomes  
a dotard, that re-election through life shall become  
habitual, and election for life follow that. General  
Washington set an example of voluntary retirement  
after eight years. I shall follow it. And a few  
more precedents will oppose the obstacles of habit  
to any one after awhile who shall endeavour to  
extend his term. Perhaps it may beget a disposi-  
tion to establish it by an amendment of the Con-  
stitution.”  
  
On the 4th of March, 1825, John Quincy  
Adams, the son of King Adams, occupied the  
presidential chair. A man of probity and  
intelligence, with the past to guide him, there  
was no danger of his repeating the mistakes of  
his father. A man of culture and a gentleman,  
he was a worthy occupant of the White House.

Just two months before President Jefler-  
son&#x27;s second Inauguration he said: &quot;My opin­  
ion originally was that the president of the  
United states should have been elected for  
seven years, and forever ineligible afterward.  
I have since become sensible tbat seven years  
is too long to be irremovable, and that there  
should be a peaceable way of withdrawing a  
man in midway who lsdolng wrong. The ser­  
vice for eight years, with a power to remove at  
the end of the first four, comes nearly to my  
principle as corrected by experience; and it Is  
in adherence to that, that I determine to with  
draw at the end of my second term. The  
danger is that the indulgence and attach­  
ments of the people will keep a man in the  
chair after he becomes a dotard, that re elec­

election for life follow that. General Washing­  
ton set the example of voluntary retirement
