Monticello, Sept. 6, ’99.  
Sir,—By a want of arrangement in a neighboring post-office during  
the absence of the postmaster, my letters and papers for two posts back  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
1896. ] Jefferson and Callender. 447  
  
were detained. I suppose it was owing to this that your letter tho’ dated  
Aug. 10, did not get to my hand till the last day of the month, since which  
this is the first day I can through the post office acknowledge the receipt of  
it. Mr. [George] Jefferson happens to be here and direets his agent to call  
on you with this and pay you 50 dollars, on account of the book you are  
about to publish. When it shall be out be so good as to send me 2. or 8.  
copies, and the rest only when I shall ask for them.  
  
The violence which was meditated against you lately has excited a very  
general indignation in this part of the country. Our state from it’s first  
plantation has been remarkable for it’s order and submission to the laws.  
But three instances are recollected in it’s history of an organized opposition  
to the laws. The first was Bacon’s Rebellion; the 2d. our revolution; the  
3d. the Richmond association who, by their committee, have in the public  
papers avowed their purpose of taking out of the hands of the law the  
function of declaring who may or may not have free residence among us.  
But these gentlemen miscalculate the temper and force of this country ex-  
tremely if they supposed there would have been a want of either to support  
the authority of the laws: and equally mistake their own interests in set-  
ting the example of club-law. Whether their self-organized election of a  
committee, and publication of their manifesto, be such overt acts as bring  
them within the pale of law; the law I presume is to decide: and there it  
is our duty to leave it. The delivery of Robbins to the British excites  
much feeling and enquiry here. With every wish for your welfare I am  
with great regard sir Your most obedient servt.  
  
Callender to Jefferson
