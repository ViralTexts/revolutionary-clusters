1. Resolved that the several states composing the US. of America are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government; but that by a compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the US. and of amendments thereto, they constituted a general government for special purposes, delegated to that government certain definite powers, reserving, each state to itself, the residuary mass of right to their own self-government; &amp; that whensoever the General government assumes undelegated powers, it’s acts are unauthoritative, void, &amp;  of no force: that to this compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral party, it’s co-states forming, as to itself, the other party: that the government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made it’s discretion, &amp; not the constitution, the measure of it’s powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions, as of the mode &amp; measure of redress.

urther to be noted that this transfer of judiciary power is to that magistrate of the general government who already possesses all the Executive, and a negative on all the Legislative powers.  
7. Resolved that the construction applied by the General government (as is evidenced by sundry of their proceedings) to those parts of the constitution of the US. which delegate to Congress a power ‘to lay &amp; collect taxes, duties, imposts &amp; excises, to pay the debts &amp; provide for the common defence &amp; general welfare of the US.’ and ‘to make all laws which shall be necessary &amp; proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the US. or in any department or officer thereof’ goes to the destruction of all the limits prescribed to their power by the constitution; that words meant by that instrument to be subsidiary only to the execution of limited powers, ought not to be so construed as themselves to give unlimited powers, nor a part to be so taken as to destroy the whole residue of that instrument: that the proceedings of the General government under colour of these articles, will be a fit &amp; necessary subject of revisal and correction, at a time of greater tranquility, while those specified in the preceding resolutions, call for immediate redress.  
8. Resolved that a committee of conference &amp; correspondence be appointed, who shall have in charge to communicate the preceding resolutions to the legislatures of the several states, to assure them that this commonwealth continues in the same esteem for their friendship and union which it has manifested from that moment at which a common  danger first suggested a common union: that it considers union, for specified national purposes, &amp; particularly for those specified in their late federal compact, to be friendly to the peace, happiness &amp; prosperity of all the states; that faithful to that compact, according to the plain intent &amp; meaning in which it was understood &amp; acceded to by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for it’s preservation: that it does also believe that to take from the states all the powers of self government, &amp; transfer them to a general &amp; consolidated government, without regard to the special delegations &amp; reservations solemnly agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace, happiness or prosperity of these states: &amp; that therefore this commonwealth is determined, as it doubts not it’s co-states are, to submit to undelegated, &amp; consequently unlimited powers in no man, or body of men, on earth: that in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers the members of the general government, being chosen by the people, a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy; but, where powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every state has a natural right, in cases not within the compact [casus non foederis] to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits: that without this right, they would be under the dominion, absolute and unlimited, of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them: that nevertheless this commonwealth, from motives of regard &amp; respect for it’s co-states, has wished to communicate with them on the subject; that with them alone it is proper to communicate, they alone being parties to the compact, &amp; solely authorized to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised under it, Congress being not a party, but merely the creature of the compact, &amp; subject, as to it’s assumptions of power, to the final judgment of those by whom, &amp; for whose use, itself, &amp; it’s powers, were all created &amp; modified: that if the acts before specified should stand, these conclusions would flow from them; that the General government may place any act they think proper on the list of crimes, &amp; punish it themselves, whether enumerated or not enumerated by the constitution as cognisable by them; that they may transfer it’s cognisance to the President, or any other person, who may himself be the accuser, counsel, judge &amp; jury, whose suspicions may be the evidence, his order the sentence, his officer the executioner, &amp; his breast the sole record of the transaction: that a very numerous &amp; valuable description of the inhabitants of these states being, by this precedent, reduced, as Outlaws, to the absolute dominion of one man, &amp; the barrier of the constitution thus swept away for us all, no rampart now remains against the passions &amp; the power of a majority in Congress, to protect from a like exportation, or other more grievous  punishment, the minority of the same body, the legislatures, judges, governors &amp; counsellors of the states, nor their other peaceable inhabitants, who may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights &amp; liberties of the states &amp; people, or who for other causes, good or bad, may be obnoxious t

9.
