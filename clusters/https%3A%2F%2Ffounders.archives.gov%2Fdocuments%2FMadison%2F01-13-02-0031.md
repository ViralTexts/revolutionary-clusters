Mr. Madison. The debate has taken a serious turn, and it will be owing to this alone if an alarm is created; for had the memorial been treated in the usual way, it would have been considered as a matter of course, and a report might have been made, so as to have given general satisfaction.

ution, for twenty years to come,  
from meddling with the slave trade. No question as to  
the reception of this petition was made, although its re­  
ference or commitment to a committee, with a view to  
its being reported upon, was vehemently opposed by  
some of the Southern members, on the ground that it  
asked Congress to do that which was unconstitutional.  
Mr. Madison advocated its reference.  
&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;misht vote for the commitment for  
referencel of the petitien without any intention of supporting the  
prager of it.&quot;  
On a subsequent day, the debate still continning, Mr.  
  
Madison said:  
&quot;The debate has taken a serious turn, and it will be owing to  
this alone, if an alarm is created; for, had the memorial been  
treated in the usual way it would have been considered as a mat  
ter of course, and a report might have been made so as to have

prayed in general terms, for the interference of Congress, so far  
as they were con-titutionally authorized; but even if its prayer  
was in some degree unconstitutional, it might be committed, as  
was done in the case of Mr Churchman&#x27;s petition, one part of which  
was supposed to apply for an uncor stitutional interference by the  
General Government.&quot;  
From 1790 down to 1835, when the question of the  
reception of abolition petitions was first made in the  
House of Representatives, all petitions, couched in de­  
corous and respectful terms, were received by Congress,  
whatever their subject matter might be. This fact was  
stated by the late Felix Grundy, in a speech made by him,  
in the Senate of the United States, on the 2d of March  
1836, from which the following is an extract:
