Dear Sir   
  
Washington Jan. 21. 09.  
  
Your letter of the 15th. was duly recieved, and before that Tower’s book, which you had been so kind as to send me, had come to hand, for which I pray you to recieve my thanks. you judge rightly that here, I have no time to read. a cursory view of the book shews me that the author is a man of much learning in his line. I have heard of some other late writer (the name I forget) who has undertaken to prove contrary events from the same sources; and particularly that England is not to be put down; and that this is the favorite author in that country. as to myself, my religious reading has long been confined to the moral branch of religion, which is the same in all religions; while in that branch which consists of dogmas, all differ, all have a different set. the former instructs us how to live well and worthily in society; the latter are made to interest our minds in the support of the teachers who inculcate them. hence for one sermon on a moral subject, you hear ten on the dogmas of the sect. however, religion is not the subject for you &amp; me. neither of us knows the religious opinions of the other. that is a matter between our maker &amp; ourselves. we understand one another better in politics, to which therefore I will proceed. the H. of Representatives passed last night a bill for a meeting of Congress on the 22d. of May. this substantially decides the course they mean to pursue. that is, to let the embargo continue till then, when it will cease, and letters of marque &amp; reprisal be issued against such nations as shall not then have repealed their obnoxious edicts. the great majority seem to have made up their minds on this, while there is considerable diversity of opinion on the details of preparation, to wit naval force, volunteers, army, non–intercourse Etc. I write freely to you, because I know that in stating facts, you will not quote names. you know that every syllable uttered in my name becomes a text for the federalists to torment the public mind on by their paraphrases &amp; perversions. I have lately inculcated the encouragement of manufactures to the extent of our own consumption at least, in all articles of which we raise the raw material. on this the federal papers &amp; meetings have sounded the alarm of Chinese policy, destruction of commerce Etc. that is to say, the iron which we make must not be wrought here into ploughs, axes, hoes Etc in order that the ship owner may have the profit of carrying it to Europe &amp; bringing it back in a manufactured form. as if, after manufacturing our own raw materials for our own use, there would not be a surplus produce sufficient to employ a due proportion of navigation in carrying it to market &amp; exchanging it for those articles of which we have not the raw material. yet this absurd hue &amp; cry has contributed much to federalize New England. their doctrine goes to the sacrificing agriculture &amp; manufactures to commerce; to the calling all our people from the interior country to the seashore to turn merchants, and to convert this great agricultural country into a city of Amsterdam. but I trust the good sense of our country will see that it’s greatest prosperity depends on a due balance between agriculture, manufactures &amp; commerce, and not in this protuberant navigation which has kept us in hot water from the commencement of our government, and is now engaging us in war. that this may be avoided, if it can be done without a surrender of rights is my sincere prayer—Accept the assurances of my constant esteem &amp; respect.

1/ear Sir: Your letter ol the 15th, was Only

Tl)ti had been *o kind n« lo lend me, had come

some oilier late writer (Hie name I fotget,)  
who has undertaken lo prove contrary events  
train the same sources ; and paiticularly, that  
England if nut to be put down ; and lliut this  
is the favorite author in that country. As tu  
myself, my religious leading has bean  
long confined to the muiul branch of  
teligione, which is the same in all religious ;  
while til iIihI branch w hich consists of dogmas  
nil differ, all have a different sett—tiie former

Federal papers and meetings have sounded the  
alarm of Chinese policy, destruction of cout­

ntav have the profit of carrying it tu Europe  
and bringing it back in a manufactured  
torm, as if after inattulucluriiig our own raw  
materials for our own use, there, would not lie  
« surplus produce sufficient lo employ a doe  
proportion of navigation in carrying it to mar-,  
k*l, and exchanging il lor those articles of  
hvhich we have not the raw material ; yet this  
absurd hue and cry has contributed much lo  
lederaltae New England ; their doctrine goes  
to the sacrificing agriculture and manufactures  
to commerce ; lo the calling all our peophi  
from the interior country lo the *ea shore to  
turn merchants ; and to convetl this great agti­  
cultnral country iuto a city of Amsterdam.

see, that its greatest prosperity depends on a  
due balance between agriculture, manufactures,

navigation, which has kept us in hot water from  
the commencement ol our goverc ment, and is  
now engaging us in a war. That this may he  
avoided, if it can be dona, without a surrender

learning in his line. , I have heard ofb&#x27;Miie other  
late writer (the name I forgot,) who &#x27; has under­  
taken to prove contrary events from the same  
sources ; and particularly, that England is i,ot  
to be put down; and that this is the favourito  
author in that country. As to myself, my reli­  
gious reading has been Ion; confined to the  
moral branch of religion, which is the same in  
all religions ; while in that branch which con­  
sists of dogmas, all differ, all have a different  
sect the former instructs us how to live well  
and worthily in society ; the latter are made to  
interest our minds in the support of the teachers  
who inculcate them; hence for one sermon on  
a moral subject, you hear ten on the dogmas of  
the sect. However, religion is not the subject  
for you and me ; neither of us know the religious  
opinions of the other, that is a matter between  
our Maker and ourselves; we understand one  
another better in politics, to which, therefore, I  
will proceed. The .House of Rrepresentatives  
passed last night, a bill for a meeting of Con­  
gress on the 22d of May ; this substantially de­  
cides the course they mean to pursue, that is,&quot; to,  
let the embargo continue till then, when it will  
cease, and letters of marque and reprisal be is­  
sued against such nations as shall not then have  
repealed their obnoxious edicts ; the great ma­  
jority seem to have made up their minds on this,  
while there is considerable diversity of opinion  
on the details of reparation, to wit, naval force,  
volunteers, army, bod intercourse, &amp;c. I , write  
freely to you, because I know that in stating  
facts, you will Dot quote names. You know that  
every syllable utterred in my name, becomes a  
text for the federalists to torment the. public  
mind on, by their paraphrases and perversions.  
  
I have lately inculcated the encouragement of  
manufactures, to the extent of our . own con­  
sumption, at least in all articles of which we  
raise the raw roateiial. On this the Federal pa  
pers and meetings have sounded the alarm of  
Chinese policy, destruction of commerce, &amp;c.  
that is to say, the iron which we make must not  
be wrought here into ploughs, axes, hoes &amp;c. in  
order that the ship owner may have the profit  
of carrying it to Europe and bringing it back in  
a manufactured form, as if after manufacturing  
our own raw materials for our own use, there  
would not be a surplus produce sufficient to em­  
ploy a due proportion of navigation in carrying  
it to market, and exchanging it for those articles  
of which we have not the raw material; yet  
this absurd hue and cry has contributed much  
to federalize New England ; their doctrine goes  
to the sacrificing agriculture and manufactures  
to commerce ; to the calling all our people from  
the interior country to the sea-shore to turn  
merchants; and to convert this great agricultu  
ral country into a city of Amsterdam. But 1  
trust the good sense of our country will see,  
that its greatest prosperity depends on a due ba-  
ance between agriculture, manufactures, and  
commerce ; and not in this protuberant naviga­  
tion, which has kept us in hot water from the  
commencement of our government, and is now  
engaging us in a war. That this may be  
avoided, if it can be done, without a surrender  
of rights, is my sincere prayer.  
Accept the assurances oi my constant esteem  
and respect.
