Dear Sir  
  
Washington June 12. 07.  
  
Mr. Jefferson not having compleated the sale of my tobacco, I am enabled to send you on 750. D. only which I  
now do in a bill of the bank of the US. here on that at Philadelphia. it will therefore be another month before the  
balance can be liquidated. I am in hopes that that will be in time for your departure; but should it not, you may direct  
the disposal of it with the same certainty as if you were here.  
The proposition in your letter of May 16. of adding an umpire to our discordant negociators at Paris, struck  
me favorably on reading it, and reflection afterwards strengthened my first impressions. I made it therefore a subject of  
consultation with my coadjutors, as is our usage. for our government, altho’, in theory, subject to be directed by the  
unadvised will of the President, is, and from it’s origin has been, a very different thing in practice. the minor business  
in each department is done by the head of the department, on consultation with the President alone. but all matters of  
importance or difficulty are submitted to all the heads of departments composing the cabinet; sometimes by the President’s  
consulting them separately &amp; successively as they happen to call on him; but in the gravest cases by calling them  
together, discussing the subject maturely, and finally taking the vote, on which the President counts himself but as one:  
so that in all important cases the Executive is, in fact, a Directory, which certainly the President might controul, but  
of this there was never an example either in the first or the present administration. I have heard indeed that my predecessor  
sometimes decided things against his council by dashing &amp; trampling his wig on the floor. this only proves what you &amp;  
I knew, that he had a better heart than head. I adopted, in the present case, the mode of separate consultation, because  
it was that in which I could best be able to keep down any suspicion that the idea had come from you. the opinion of each  
member, taken separately, was that the addition of a third negociator was not at this time advisable. For the present  
therefore the question must rest. mr Bowdoin, we know, is anxious to come home, &amp; is detained only by the delicacy of  
not deserting his post. in the existing temper between him &amp; his colleague it would certainly be better that one of them  
should make an opening for recomposing the commission more harmoniously.

negotiators at Paris, struck me favorably on  
reading it, and reflection afterwards strength­  
ened my first impressions.; I made it there­  
fore a subject of consultation with mycoadjutors,-as  
is our usage. For our government,  
although in theory subject to be directed by  
the unadvised will ofthe President, is, and  
from its origin has, been, a very different  
thing in practice. The minor business in  
each department is done by the Head of the  
department, on consultation with the Presi­  
dent alone. But all matters of importance  
or difficulty are Submitted to all the Heads of  
departments composing the cabinet; some­  
times by ther Predsienfs consulting them  
separately and successively, as they happen  
to call on him; but in the &#x27; greatest cases, by  
calling them together, discussing the subject  
maturely, and finally taking the vote; in which  
the President counts himself as one. So that in  
all important cases the executive is, in fact,  
a directory, which certainly the President  
might control, but of this there was never an  
example either in. the first or the present ad­  
ministration.7&#x27; Raleigh Register

“ All matters of importance or difficul-  
ty,” he once wrote, “are submitted to  
all the heads of departments compos-  
i the Cabinet, by the  
President consulting them separately  
  
ing sometimes  
and successively, as they happen to  
call upon him; but, in the greatest  
cases, by calling them together, dis-  
cussing the subject maturely, and final-  
ly taking the vote, in which the Presi-  
dent counts himself but as one. So  
that, in all important cases, the execu-  
tive is in fact a Directory, which cer-  
tainly the President might control ;  
but of this there never was an example,  
either in the first or the present ad-  
ministration.”
