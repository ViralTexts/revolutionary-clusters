You have been informed of the loss of our Election in this City. It is also known that we have been unfortunate throughout Long Island &amp; in West Chester. According to the Returns hitherto, it is too probable that we lose our Senators for this District.  
The moral certainty therefore is that there will be an Anti-fœderal Majority in the Ensuing Legislature, and this very high probability is that this will bring Jefferson into the Chief Magistracy; unless it be prevented by the measure which I shall now submit to your consideration, namely the immediate calling together of the existing Legislature.  
I am aware that there are weighty objections to the measure; but the reasons for it appear to me to outweigh the objections. And in times like these in which we live, it will not do to be overscrupulous. It is easy to sacrifice the substantial interests of society by a strict adherence to ordinary rules.  
In observing this, I shall not be supposed to mean that any thing ought to be done which integrity will forbid—but merely that the scruples of delicacy and propriety, as relative to a common course of things, ought to yield to the extraordinary nature of the crisis. They ought not to hinder the taking of a legal and constitutional step, to prevent an Atheist in Religion and a Fanatic in politics from getting possession of the helm of the State.  
You Sir know in a great degree the Antifœderal party, but I fear that you do not know them as well as I do. Tis a composition indeed of very incongruous materials but all tending to mischief—some of them to the overthrow of the Government by stripping it of its due energies others of them to a Revolution after the manner of Buonaparte. I speak from indubitable facts, not from conjectures &amp; inferences.  
In proportion as the true character of this party is understood is the force of the considerations which urge to every effort to disappoint it. And it seems to me that there is a very solemn obligation to employ the means in our power.  
The calling of the Legislature will have for object the choosing of Electors by the people in Districts. This (as Pennsylvania will do nothing) will insure a Majority of votes in the U States for Fœderal Candidates.  
The measure will not fail to be approved by all the Fœderal Party; while it will no doubt be condemned by the opposite. As to its intrinsic nature it is justified by unequivocal reasons for public safety.

not control the newly elected Legislature,  
Haniilton wrote: “ihe moral certainty, tbere-

high probability that this will bring Jefferson  
into the chief magistracy, unless it be pre-  
vented by the measure wiich I| shall now sub-  
mit to your consideration, namely, the immedi-  
ate calling together of the existing Legisla-  
ture. I am aware that there are objections to  
the measure, but the reasons for it appear to  
outweigh the objections. . . . ‘The calling  
of the Legislature will have for its object the  
choosing of electors by the people in districts;  
this (as Pennsylvania will do nothing) will en-  
sure a majority of votes in the United States

prevent the success of Bryan.  
After the New York election, in which the Republicans were successful, Hamilton  
urged Governor Jay to call the old Federalist Legislature in extra session to deprive  
the new Republican Legislature of the power of choosing electors. He admitted that  
such a measure would not be regular or proper, but, he explained, “scruples of de­  
licacy and propriety ought not to hinder the taking of a legal  
and constitutional step to prevent an atheist in religion and  
a fanatic in politics from getting possession of the helm of  
of state.” Jefferson’s party, he added, was “a composition, in­  
deed, of very incongruous materials, but all tending to mis­  
chief; some of them to the overthrow of the Government by  
stripping it of its due energies; others of them to a revolution,  
after the manner of Bonaparte. I speak from indubitable  
facts, not from conjectures and inferences.”
