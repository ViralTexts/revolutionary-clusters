Notes on the establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States.  
In fixing the Unit of money, these circumstances are of principal importance.  
I. That it be of convenient size to be applied as a measure to the common money transactions of life.  
II. That it’s parts and multiples be in an easy proportion to each other, so as to facilitate the money arithmetic.  
III. That the Unit and it’s parts, or divisions be so nearly of the value of some of the known coins as that they may be of easy adoption for the people.  
The Spanish Dollar seems to fulfil all these conditions.  
I. Taking into our view all money transactions, great and small, I question if a common measure of more convenient size than the Dollar could be proposed. The value of 100, 1000, 10,000 dollars is well estimated by the mind. So is that of the tenth or the hundredth of a dollar. Few transactions are above or below these limits. The expediency of attending to the size of the Money Unit will be evident to any one who will consider how inconvenient it would be to a manufacturer or merchant, if, instead of the yard for measuring cloth, either the inch or the mile had been made the Unit of measure.  
  
II. The most easy ratio of multiplication and division is that by ten. Every one knows the facility of Decimal Arithmetic. Every one remembers, that, when learning money arithmetic, he used to be puzzled with adding the farthings, taking out the fours and carrying them on; adding the pence, taking out the twelves and carrying them on; adding the shillings, taking out the twenties and carrying them on. But when he came to the pounds, where he had only tens to carry forward, it was easy and free from error. The bulk of mankind are school boys thro’ life. These little perplexities are always great to them. And even Mathematical heads feel the relief of an easier substituted for a more difficult process. Foreigners too who trade or travel among us will find a great facility in understanding our coins and accounts from this ratio of subdivision. Those who have had occasion to convert the Livres, sols and deniers of the French, the Gilders, stivers, and penings of the Dutch, the Pounds, shillings, pence and farthings of these several states into each other can judge how much they would have been aided had their several subdivisions been in a decimal ratio. Certainly in all cases where we are free to chuse between easy and difficult modes of operation, it is most rational to chuse the easy. The Financier therefore in his report, well proposes that our Coins should be in decimal proportions to one another. If we adopt the Dollar for our Unit, we should strike four coins, one of gold, two of silver, and one of copper, viz.  
  
1. a Golden peice equal in value to 10. Dollars.  
2. the Unit, or Dollar itself, of silver.  
3. the Tenth of a Dollar, of silver also.  
4. the Hundredth of a Dollar, of copper.

1/12| 1.39(1 8  
£69 11 8  
  
A bare inspection of the above operations will evince the labour which is occasioned by subdividing the Unit into 20ths. 240ths. and 960ths. as the English do, and as we have done; and the ease of subdivisions in a decimal ratio. The same difference arises in making paiment. An Englishman to pay £8–13s–11d ½qrs. must find by calculation what combination of the coins of his country will pay this sum. But an American, having the same sum to pay, thus expressed 38.D.65 will know by inspection only that 3. golden peices, 8 units or Dollars, 6 tenths and 5 coppers pay it precisely.  
III. The third condition required is that the Unit, it’s multiples, and subdivisions coincide in value with some of the known coins so nearly, that the people may, by a quick reference in the mind, estimate their value. If this be not attended to, they will be very long in adopting the innovation, if ever they adopt it. Let us examine in this point of view each of the 4. coins proposed.  
1.The Golden peice will be ⅕ more than a half Joe, and 1/15 more than a double guinea. It will be readily estimated then by reference to either of them; but more readily and accurately as equal to 10. dollars.  
2.The Unit or Dollar is a known coin, and the most familiar of all to the minds of the people. It is already adopted from South to North; has identified our currency, and therefore happily offers itself as an Unit already introduced. Our public debt, our requisitions, and their apportionments have given it actual and long possession of the place of Unit. The course of our commerce too  will bring us more of this than of any other foreign coin, and therefore renders it more worthy of attention. I know of no Unit which can be proposed in competition with the Dollar, but the Pound. But what is the Pound? 1547. grains of fine silver in Georgia; 1289. grains in Virginia, Connecticut, Rhode island, Massachusets, and New Hampshire; 1031 ¼ grains in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; 966 ¾ grains in North Carolina and New York. Which of these shall we adopt? To which state give that preeminence of which all are so jealous? And on which impose the difficulties of a new estimate for their corn, their cattle and other commodities? Or shall we hang the pound sterling, as a common badge, about all their necks? This contains 1718 ¾ grains of pure silver. It is difficult to familiarize a new coin to the people. It is more difficult to familiarize them to a new coin with an old name. Happily the Dollar is familiar to them all; and is already as much referred to for a measure of value as their respective provincial pounds.  
3. The Tenth will be precisely the Spanish Bit, or half pistereen. This is a coin perfectly familiar to us all. When we shall make a new coin then equal in value to this, it will be of ready estimate with the people.  
4. The Hundredth, or Copper, will differ little from the copper of the 4. Eastern states which is 1/108 of a dollar; still less from the penny of New York and N. Carolina which is 1/96 of a dollar: and somewhat more from the penny or Copper of Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland which is 1/90 of a Dollar. It will be about the medium between the old and the new coppers of these states, and therefore will soon be substituted for them both. In Virginia coppers have never been in use. It will be as easy therefore to introduce them there of one value as of another. The Copper coin proposed will be nearly equal to three fourths of their penny, which is the same with the penny lawful of the Eastern states.  
A great deal of small change is useful in a state, and tends to reduce the prices of small articles. Perhaps it would not be amiss to coin three more peices of silver, one of the value of five tenths, or half a dollar, one of the value of two Tenths which would be equal to the Spanish pistereen, and one of the value of 5. Coppers, which would be equal to the Spanish halfbit. We should then have five silver coins, viz.  
  
1. the Unit or Dollar.  
2. the half dollar or five tenths.  
  
3. the double Tenth, equal to .2, or ⅕ of a Dollar, or to the Pistereen.  
4. the Tenth equal to a Spanish Bit.  
5. the five copper peice equal to .05 or 1/20 of a Dollar, or to the Halfbit.  
  
The plan reported by the Financier is worthy of his sound judgment. It admits however of objection in the size of the Unit. He proposes that this shall be the 1440th. part of a Dollar: so that it will require 1440. of his units to make the one before proposed. He was led to adopt this by a mathematical attention to our old currencies all of which this Unit will measure without leaving a fraction. But as our object is to get rid of those currencies the advantage derived from this coincidence will soon be past, whereas the inconveniencies of this Unit will for ever remain, if they do not altogether prevent it’s introduction. It is defective in two of the three requisites of a Money unit. 1. It is inconvenient in it’s application to the ordinary money transactions. 10,000 dollars will require 8. figures to express them, to wit, 14,400,000 Units. A horse or bullock of 80. dollars value will require a notation of six figures, to wit, 115,200 Units. As a money of account this will be laborious, even when facilitated by the aid of decimal arithmetic: as a common measure of the value of property it will be too minute to be comprehended by the people. The French are subjected to very laborious calculations, the Livre being their ordinary money of account, and this but between ⅕ and ⅙ of a dollar. But what will be our labours, should our money of account be 1/1440th of a Dollar only?  
2. It is neither equal, nor near to, any of the known coins in value.  
If we determine that a Dollar shall be our Unit, we must then say with precision what a Dollar is. This coin, as struck at different times, of different weights and fineness, is of different values. Sr. Isaac Newton’s assay and representation to the Lords of the Treasury in 1717 of those which he examined, make their values as follows.

The Financier states the old dollar as containing 376. grains of fine silver, and the new 365 grains. If the dollars circulating among us be of every date equally, we should examine the quantity of pure metal in each and from them form an average for our Unit. This is a work proper to be committed to Mathematicians as well as Merchants, and which should be decided on actual and accurate experiment.  
The quantum of alloy is also to be decided. Some is necessary to prevent the coin from wearing too fast. Too much fills our pockets with copper instead of silver. The silver coins assayed by Sr. Isaac Newton varied from 1 ½ to 76 pennyweight alloy in the pound Troy of mixed metal. The British standard has 18. dwt. The Spanish coins assayed by Sr. Isaac Newton have from 18. to 19 ½ dwt., the new French crown has in fact 19 ½, tho’ by edict it should have 20 dwt. that is 1/12. The taste of our countrymen will require that their furniture plate should be as good as the British standard. Taste cannot be controuled by law. Let it then give the law in a point which is indifferent to a certain degree. Let the legislatures fix the alloy of furniture plate at 18. dwt. the British standard and Congress that of their coin at one ounce in the pound, the French standard. This proportion has been found convenient for the alloy of gold coin, and it will simplify the system of our mint to alloy both metals in the same degree. The coin too being the least pure, will be less easily melted into plate. These reasons are light indeed, and of course will only weigh if no heavier ones can be opposed to them.  
The proportion between the values of gold and silver is a mercantile problem altogether. It would be inaccurate to fix it by the popular exchanges of a half Joe for eight dollars, a Louis for 4. French crowns, or 5. Louis for 23. Dollars. The first of these would be to adopt the Spanish proportion between gold and silver; the second the French; the third a mere popular barter, wherein convenience is consulted more than accuracy. The legal proportion in Spain is 16. for 1. in England 15 ⅕ for 1. in France 15. for 1. The Spaniards and English are found in experience to retain an overproportion of gold coins and to lose their silver. The French have a greater proportion of silver. The difference at market has been on the decrease. The Financier states it at present as at 14 ½ for 1. Just principles will lead us to disregard legal proportions altogether; to enquire into the market price of gold in the several countries with which we shall principally be connected in commerce, and to take an average from them. Perhaps we might with  safety lean to a proportion somewhat above par for gold, considering our neighborhood and commerce with the sources of the coins, and the tendency which the high price of gold in Spain has to draw thither all that of their mines, leaving silver principally for our, and other markets. It is not impossible that 15. for 1. may be found an eligible proportion. I state it however as conjectural only.  
As to the alloy for gold coin, the British is an ounce in the pound; the French, Spanish and Portuguese differ from that only from a quarter of a grain to a grain and a half. I should therefore prefer the British, merely because it’s fraction stands in a more simple form, and facilitates the calculations into which it enters.  
Should the Unit be fixed at 365 grains of pure silver, gold at 15. for 1. and the alloy of both be one twelfth, the weights of the coins will be as follows.

The quantity of fine silver which shall constitute the Unit being settled, and the proportion of the value of gold to that of silver; a table should be formed from the assay before suggested, classing the several foreign coins according to their fineness, declaring the worth of a pennyweight or grain in each class, and that they shall be lawful tenders at those rates, if not clipped or otherwise diminished; and where diminished offering their value for them at the mint, deducting the expence of recoinage. Here the legislatures should cooperate with Congress in providing that no money be received or paid at their treasuries, or by any of their officers, or any bank but on actual weight; in making it criminal in a high degree to diminish their own coins, and in some smaller degree to offer them in paiment when diminished.  
That this subject may be properly prepared and in readiness for Congress to take up at their meeting in November, something must now be done. The present session drawing to a close they probably would not chuse to enter far into this undertaking themselves. The Committee of the states however, during the recess  will have time to digest it thoroughly, if Congress will fix some general principles for their government. Suppose then they be instructed  
To appoint proper persons to assay and examine, with the utmost accuracy practicable, the Spanish milled dollars of different dates in circulation with us.  
To assay and examine in like manner the fineness of all other the coins which may be found in circulation within these states.  
To report to the Committee the result of these assays, by them to be laid before Congress.  
To appoint also proper persons to enquire what are the proportions between the values of fine gold and fine silver at the markets of the several countries with which we are or probably may be connected in commerce; and what would be a proper proportion here, having regard to the average of their values at those markets and to other circumstances, and to report the same to the Committee by them to be laid before Congress.  
To prepare an Ordinance for establishing the Unit of money within these states; for subdividing it; and for striking coins of gold, silver, and copper on the following principles.  
That the Money Unit of these states shall be equal in value to a Spanish milled dollar, containing so much fine silver as the assay before directed shall shew to be contained on an average in dollars of the several dates in circulation with us.  
That this Unit shall be divided into Tenths and Hundredths:  
That there shall be a coin of silver of the value of an Unit:  
One other of the same metal of the value of one Tenth of of an Unit:  
One other of Copper of the value of the Hundredth of an Unit:  
That there shall be a coin of Gold of the value of ten Units, according to the report before directed and the judgment of the Committee thereon;  
That the alloy of the said coins of Gold and Silver shall be equal in weight to one eleventh part of the fine metal.  
That there be proper devices for these coins:  
That measures be proposed for preventing their diminution, and also their currency and that of any others when diminished.  
That the several foreign coins be described and classed in the said Ordinance, the fineness of each class stated, and it’s value by weight estimated in Units and decimal parts of Units.  
And that the said draught of an Ordinance be reported to  Congress at their next meeting for their consideration and determination.  
Supplementory Explanations  
The preceding notes having been submitted to the Consideration of the Financier, he favored me with his opinion and observations on them, which render necessary the following supplementory explanations.  
I observed in the preceding notes that the true proportion of value between gold and silver was a mercantile problem altogether and that perhaps 15. for 1. might be found an eligible proportion. The Financier is so good as to inform me that this would be higher than the market would justify. Confident of his better information on this subject, I recede from that idea.  
He also informs me that the several coins in circulation among us have been already assayed with accuracy, and the result published in a work on that subject. The assay of Sr. Isaac Newton had superseded, in my mind, the necessity of this operation as to the older coins which were the subject of his examination. This later work with equal reason may be considered as saving the same trouble as to the latter.  
So far then I accede to the opinions of the Financier. On the other hand he seems to concur with me in thinking his smallest fractional division too minute for an unit, and therefore proposes to transfer that denomination to his largest silver coin containing 1000 of the units first proposed, and worth about 4/2 lawful or 25/36 of a dollar. The only question then remaining between us is Whether the Dollar, or this coin, be best for the Unit. We both agree that the ease of adoption with the people is the thing to be aimed at.  
1. As to the Dollar, events have overtaken and superseded the question. It is no longer a doubt whether the people can adopt it with ease. They have actually adopted it, and will be to be turned out of that into another tract of calculation if another Unit be assumed. They have now two Units, which they use with equal facility, viz. the pound of their respective state, and the dollar. The  first of these is peculiar to each state: the second happily common to all. In each state the people have an easy rule for converting the pound of their state into dollars, or dollars into pounds. And this is enough for them without knowing how this may be done in every state of the Union. Such of them as live near enough the borders of their state to have dealings with their neighbors learn also the rule of their neighbors. Thus in Virginia and the Eastern states where the dollar is 6/ or 3/10 of a pound, to turn pounds into dollars they multiply by 10. and divide by 3. to turn dollars into pounds they multiply by 3. and divide by 10. Those in Virginia who live near to Carolina where the dollar is 8/ or 4/10 of a pound learn the operation of that state, which is a multiplication by 4. and division by 10 et e converso. Those who live near Maryland where the dollar is 7/6 or ⅜ of a pound, multiply by 3 and divide by 8, or e converso. All these operations are easy, and have been found by experience not too much for the arithmetic of the people, when they have occasion to convert their old unit into dollars, or the reverse.  
2. As to the Unit of the Financier in the states where the dollar is 3/10 of a pound, this Unit will be 5/24. It’s conversion into the pound then will be by a multiplication by 5 and division by 24. In the states where the dollar is ⅜ of a pound, this unit will be 25/96 of a pound, and the operation must be to multiply by 25 and divide by 96. or e converso. Where the dollar is 4/10 of a pound, this unit will be 5/18. The simplicity of the fraction, and of course the facility of conversion and reconversion, is therefore against this unit, and in favor of the dollar, in every instance. The only advantage it has over the dollar is that it will in every case express our farthings without a remainder; whereas, tho the dollar and it’s decimals will do this in many cases, it will not in all. But, even in these, by extending your notation one figure further, to wit, to thousandths, you approximate to perfect accuracy within less than the two thousandth part of a dollar; an atom in money which every one would neglect. Against this single inconvenience the other advantages of the dollar are more than sufficient to preponderate. This unit will present to the people a new coin, and whether they endeavor to estimate it’s value by comparing it with a pound, or with a dollar, the Units they now possess, they will find the fraction very compound, and of course less accomodated to their comprehension and habits than the dollar. Indeed the probability is that they could never be led to compute in it generally.  
The Financier supposes that the 1/100 of a dollar is not sufficiently  small where the poor are purchasers or venders. If it is not, make a smaller coin. But I suspect that it is small enough. Let us examine facts, in countries where we are acquainted with them. In Virginia, where our towns are few, small, and of course their demand for necessaries very limited, we have never yet been able to introduce a copper coin at all. The smallest coin which any body will receive there is the half-bit, or 1/20 of a dollar. In those states where the towns are larger and more populous, a more habitual barter for small wants has called for a copper coin 1/90 or 1/96 or 1/108 of a dollar. In England where the towns are many and populous, and where ages of experience have matured the conveniencies of intercourse, they have found that some wants may be supplied for a farthing, or 1/216 of a dollar, and they have accomodated a coin to this want. This business is evidently progressive. In Virginia we are far behind. In some other states they are farther advanced, to wit to the appreciation of 1/90, 1/96, 1/108 of a dollar. To this most advanced state then I accomodated my smallest coin in the decimal arrangement as a money of paiment, corresponding with the money of account. I have no doubt the time will come when a smaller coin will be called for. When it comes, let it be made. It will probably be the half of the copper I propose, that is to say 5/1000 or .005 of a dollar, this being very nearly the farthing of England. But it will be time enough to make it when the people shall be ready to receive it.  
My proposition then is that our Notation of money shall be decimal, descending ad libitum of the person noting; that the Unit of this notation shall be a dollar, that coins shall be accomodated to it from ten dollars to the hundredth of a dollar; and that to set this on foot, the resolutions be adopted which were proposed in the Notes, only substituting an enquiry into the fineness of the coins in lieu of an assay of them.  
  
  
In a newspaper which frequently gives good details in political œconomy I find under the Hamburgh head that the present market price of gold and silver is in England 15.5 for 1; in Russia 15; in Holland 14.75; in Savoy 14.6; in France 14.42; in Spain 14.3; in Germany 14.155; the average of which is 14.675 or 14 ⅝. I would still incline to give a little more than the market price for gold because of it’s superior convenience in transportation. [Ed. Note:—TJ gathered this information

ON THE  
  
 FSTABLISMEAS  
  
*  
  
OD A  
MONEY UNIT,  
4D VF Mi  
  
5 COINAGE fon THE UNITED STATES.  
  
—  
  
IN fixing the Unit of Money, theſe circumſtances are of  
principal imporrance, |  
  
I. That it be of convenient ſize to be applied as a mea-  
ſure to the common money tranſactions of life.  
  
IT. That its parts and multiples be in an eaſy propor-  
tion to each other, ſo as to facilitate the money arich -  
metic.  
  
III. That the unit and its parts or diviſions be ſo near-  
ly of the value cf ſome of the noms coins, as that they  
may be of eaſy adoption for the people.  
  
The Spanish dollar ſeems to Fulfil all theſe conditions.  
  
I. Taking into our view all money tranſaQtions, great  
and ſmall, I queſtion if a common meaſure of more con-  
  
1  
venient ſize than the dollar could be propoſed. The va-  
lue of 100, 1000, 10,c00 dollars is well eſtimated by the  
mind. So is that of the tenth or the hundredth of a dol-  
lar. Few tranſactions are above or below theſe limits,  
The expediency of attending tothe ſize of the money unit  
will be evident to any one who will conſider how incon-  
venient it would be to a manufacturer or merchant, if  
inſtead of the yard for meaſuring cloth, either the inch or  
the mile had been made the unit of meaſure,  
  
IT. The moſt eaſy ratio of multiplication and diviſion  
is that by ten, Every one knows the facility of decimal  
arithmetic. Every one remembers, that, when learnin  
money- arithmetic, he uſed to be puzzled with adding the  
farthings, taking out the fours and carrying them on ; ad-  
ding the pence, taking our the twelves, and carrying them  
on; adding the shillings, taking out the twenties and car-  
  
ing them on. But when he came to the pounds, where  
he had only tens to carry forward, it was eaſy and free  
from error. The bulk of mankind are ſchool boys thro”  
life. Theſe little perplexities are always great to them,  
And even mathematical heads feel the relief of an eaſier  
ſubſtituted for a more difficult proceſs. Foreigners too  
who trade or travel among us, will find a great facility in  
underſtanding our coins and accounts from this ratio of  
ſubdiviſion. Thoſe who have had occaſion to convert the  
livres, ſols and deniers of the French, the gilders, ſtivers  
and penings of the Dutch, the pounds, shillings, pence and  
farthings of theſe ſeveral ſtares into each other, can judge  
how much they would have been aided had their ſeveral  
ſubdivifions been ina decimal ratio. Certainly in all caſes  
Where we are free to chuſe between eaſy and difficult  
modes of operation, it is moſt rational to chuſe the eaſy.  
The Financier, therefore, in his report, well propoſes thay  
out coins should be in decimal proportions to one another.  
If we adopt the dollar for our unit, we should ſtrike four  
coins, one of gold, two of ſilver, and one of copper. viz.  
  
1. A golden piece equal in value to 10 dollars,  
  
2. The unit, or dollar, of ſilver.  
  
3. The tenth of a dollar, of ſilver alſo.

A bare inſpection of the above operations will evince  
the labour which is occaſioned by ſubdividing the unit into  
zoths, 24oths, and g6oths, as the English do, and as we  
have done; and the eaſe of ſubdiviſions in a decimal ratio.  
The ſame difference ariſes in making payment. An Eng-  
lishman, to pay 81. 13s. 11d. 5qrs. mult find by calculation  
what combination of the coins of his country will pay this  
ſum. But an American, having the ſame ſum to pay, thus  
expreſſed 38.65 Dollars, will know by inſpection only,  
that 3 golden pieces, &amp; units or dollars, 6 tenths and five  
coppers pay it preciſely,  
  
III. The third condition required, is that the unit, its  
mulriples, and ſubdivifions coincide in value with ſome  
of the known coins ſo nearly, that the people may, by 2  
quick reference in the mind, eſtimate their value. If this  
be not attended to, they will be very long in adopting the  
innovation, if ever they adopt it. Let us examine In this  
point of view each of the four coins propoſed.  
  
  
  
  
  
l  
1. The golden piece will be more than a half Joe,  
and n more than a double guinea. It will be readily eſti-  
mated then by refercnce to cither of them ; bur more rea»  
dily and accurately as equal to 10 dollars, |  
2. The unit or dollar is a known coin, andthe moſt fa-  
  
  
ed from South to North; has identified our currency, and  
therefore happily offers itſelfas an unit already introduced.  
Our public debt, our requiſitions, and their apportion-  
ments have given it actual and long poſſeſſion o — place  
of unit. The courſe of our commerce too will bring us  
more of this than of any other foreign coin, and therefore  
renders it more worthy of attention. I know of no unit  
which can be propoſed in competition with the dollar, but  
the pound. But What is the pound? 1547 grains of fine  
ſilyer in Georgia; 1259 grains in Virginia, Connecticut,  
Rhode iſſand, Maſſachuſets, and New Hampshire; 10314  
2 in Maryland, Delaware, Pennſylvania, and New  
  
erſey; 966 grains in North Carolina and New York.  
Which of theſe shall we adopt? To which ſtate give that  
  
re-eminence, of which all are ſo jealous? And on which  
impoſe the difficulties of a new eſtimate for their corn, their  
cattle, and other commodities ? Or shall we hang the  
pound ſterling, as a common badge, about all their necks?  
This contains 718 5 grains of pure filver. It is difficult  
ro familiarize a new coin to the people. It is more diffi-  
cult to familiarize them to a new coin with an old name.  
Howe the dollar is familiar to them all ; and is alread  
as much referred to for a meaſure of value as their reſ-  
pective provincial pounds.  
  
3. The Tenth will be preciſely the Spanish bir, or half  
piſtereen. This is a coin Familiar to us all. When we shall  
make a ne coin then equal in value to this, it will be of  
ready eſtimate With the people.  
  
4. The hundredth, or copper, will differ little from the  
copper of the four Eaſtern ſtates, which is 281 of adollar ;  
ſtill lefs from the penny of New Vork and North Caro-  
  
  
penny or copper of Jerſey, Pennſylyania, Delaware and  
Maryland, which is ; of a dollar, It will then be about  
  
[ 6 ]  
  
the medium between the old and the new e  
  
ſtates, and therefore will ſoon be ſubſtituted for mo o-  
In Virginia coppers have never been in uſe, It will be  
as eaſy therefore to introduce them there of one valuc as  
of another. The copper coin propoſed will be nearly  
equal to three four hs of their penny, which is the fame  
with the penny lawful of the Eaſtern ſtares.  
  
A grear inte ſmall — is uſeful in a ſtate, and tends  
to reduce the prices of mall articles. Perhaps it would  
not be amiſs to coin 3 ſupplementory pieces of ſilver, one of  
the value of five tenths, or half a dollar, one of the value of  
two tenths, which would be equal to the Spanish piſte-  
reen, and one f the value of five coppers, which would  
  
be equal to the Spanish halſbit. We should chen have five  
filyer coins, viz, |  
  
1. The unit or dollar  
  
2. The half dollar or five tenths.  
  
3. The double tenth, equal to .z, or q of a dollar, or  
to the piſtereen.  
  
4. The tenth, equal toa Spanish bir.  
  
5. The five copper piece equal to. o or 35 of a dollar,  
or to the half bit.  
The plan reported by the Financier is worthy of his ſound  
judgment. Ir admits however of objection in the ſize of  
the unit. He propoſes that this shall be the 440 th part  
of a dollar: ſo that it will require 1440 of his units to  
make the one before propoſed. He was led to adopt this  
by a mathematical a tention to our old currencies all of  
which this unit will meaſure Without leaving a fr. ction.  
But as our object is to get rid of theſe currencies, the ad-  
vautage derived from this coincidence will ſoon be paſt,  
whereas the inconyer:iencics of this unit will for ever re-  
main, if they do not altogether prevent its introduction.  
It is defective in two of the three requiſites of a money  
unit. |  
  
1. It is inconvenient in its application to the ordinary  
money tranſactions. o, ooo dollars will require 8 *  
to expreſs them, to wit, 4, 40, o units. A horſe or  
bullock, of 80 dollars value, will require a notation of  
fix figures, to wit, 115, 200 units. As a money of account  
  
1  
  
this will be laborious, even when facilitated by the aid of  
decimal arithmetic: as a common meaſure of the value  
of property, it will be too minute to be comprehended by  
the people. The French are ſubjected to very laborious  
calculations, the livze being their ordinary money of ac-  
count, and this but between + and ; of a dollar. But what  
will be our labours, should our money of account be  
7z5zth of a dollar only?  
  
2. Ir is neither equal, nor near to any of the known  
coins in value. |  
  
If wedetermine that a dollar shall be our unit, we muſt  
then (ay with preciſion what a dollar is. This coin, as  
ſtruck at different times, of different weights and fineneſs,  
is of different values. Sir Iſaac Newton&#x27;s aſſay and re-  
2 to the Lords of the Treaſury in 1717 of  
  
ole which he examined, made their values as follows:  
  
dwt. grs. grains.  
  
The Seville piece of eight, 17 12 387 of pure ſil-  
The Mexico piece of eight, 17 103 3857 ver.  
The Pillar piece of eight, 17 9 5 3853 |  
The newSeville piece of eight, x4 o @ 308  
  
The Financier ſtates the old dollar as containing 376

rs circulating among us be of every dare equally, we  
should examine the quantity of pure metal in each, and  
from them form an average for our unit. This is a work  
proper to be committed to Mathemaricians as well as Mer-  
chants, and which should be decided on actual and accurate  
experiment.  
  
The quantum of alloy is alſo to be decided. Some is  
neceſſary to prevent the coin from wearing too faſt. Too  
much would fill our pockets with copper inſtead ofſilver. The  
ſilver coins aſſayed by Sir Iſaac Newton varied from 1 +  
to 76 penny- weight alloy in the pound Troy of mixed me-  
tal. The British ſtandard has 18 dwt. The Spanish coins  
aſſayed by Sir Iſaac Newton have from 18 to 19 f dwr.  
The new French crown has in fact 15 5, though by edict  
it should have 20 dwr. that is . The taſte of our coun-  
trymen Will require that their furniture plate chould be as  
good as the Bridsh ſtandard, Taſte cannot be controuled  
  
E  
  
by law. Let it then give the law in a point which is in-  
different to a certain degree. Let the legiſlatures fix the  
alloy of furniture plate at 18 dwt. the British ſtandard,  
and Congreſs that of their coin at one ounce in the  
  
ound, the French ſtandard. This proportion has been  
— convenient for the alloy of gold coin, and it v ill  
ſimplify the ſyſtem of our mint to alloy both metals in the  
ſame degree. The coin too being the leaſt pure, will be leſs  
eaſily melted into plate. Theſe reaſons are light indeed,  
and of courſe will only weigh if no heavicr ones can be  
oppoſed to them.  
  
The proportion between the values of gold and ſilver  
is a mercantile problem altogether. It would be inaccu-  
rate to fix it by the popular exchanges of a half Toe for  
eight dollars, a Louis for four French crowns, or five  
Louis for twenty-three dollars. The firſt of theſe would  
be to adopt the Spanish proportion between gold and il -  
ver; the ſecond the French; the third a mere popular  
barter, wherein convenience is conſulted more than ac-  
curacy. The legal proportion in Spain is 16 for 1, in  
England 15 for 1, in France 15 for 1. The Spaniards  
— English are found in experience to retain an over- pro-  
  
ortion of gold coins and to loſe their filver. The French  
— a greater proportion of ſilver. The difference at  
market has been on the decreaſe. The Financier ſtates it  
at preſent as at 14 f for 1. Juſt principles will lead us to  
diſregard legal proportions altogether; to enquire into the  
marker price of gold in the ſeveral countries with which  
we shall principally be connected in commerce, and to  
take an average from them, Perhaps we might with ſafe-  
lean to a proportion ſomewhat above par for gold, con-  
Gering our neighbourhood and commerce with the ſources  
of the coins, and the tendency which the high price of  
gold in Spain has to draw thither all that of their mines,  
leaving the ſilver principally for our, and other markets.  
  
It is not impoſſible that 15 for 1, may be found an eli-  
gible proportion. I ſtate it however as conjectural only.  
  
As to the alloy for gold coin, the British is an ounce in  
the pound; the French, Spanish, and Portugueſe differ

T HE preceding notes having been ſubmitted to the  
conſideration of the Financier, he favored me with his

I obſerved in the preceding notes, that the true propor-  
tion of value between gold and ſilver Was a mercantile  
problem altogether, * that perhaps 15 for 1 might be  
found an eligible proportion, The Financier is ſo good  
as to inform me, that this would be higher than the mar-  
ker would juſtify, Confident&#x27; of his better information  
on this ſubje&amp;, I recede from that idea.*

* In a Newſpaper, which frequently gives good details in politi-

4  
and the reſult published in a work on that ſubject. The  
aſſay of Sir Iſaac Newton had ſuperſeded, in my mind,  
the neceſſity of this operation as to — older coins, Which  
were the ſubject of his examination. This latter work,  
with equal reaſon, may be conſiderod as ſaving the ſame  
trouble as to the latter coins.  
  
So far then I accede to the opinions of the Financier.  
On the other hand, he ſeems to concur with me in think-  
ing his ſmalleſt fractional diviſion too minute for an unit,  
and therefore propoſes to transfer that denomination to  
his r= filver coin, containing 1000 of the units firſt  
propoſed, and worth about 4/2 lawful, or 1 of a dollar.  
The only queſtion then remaining between as, is whether  
the dollar, or this coin, be beſt for the unit. We both  
agree that the eaſe of adoption wii the people is the thing  
to be aimed at.  
  
t. As to the dollar, events have overtaken and ſuper-  
ceded the queſtion. It is no longer a doubt whether the peo-  
ple can adopt it with eaſe. They have actually adopted  
it, and will be tobe turned out of that into another tract  
of calculation, if another unit be aſſumed. They have  
now two units, which they uſe with equal facility, viz.  
the pound of their reſpective ſtate, and the dollar. The  
firſt of theſe is peculiar to each ſtate : the ſecond happily  
common to all, In each ſtate the people have an eaſy rule  
for converting the pound of their ſtate into dollars, or  
dollars into pounds. And this is enough for them with-  
out knowing how this may be done in every ſtate of the  
union. Such of them as live near enough the borders of  
their ſtate to have dealings with their neighbours, learn  
alſo the rule of their bout. Thus in Virginia, and  
the Eaſtern ſtates, where the dollar is / or of a pound,  
to turn pounds into dollars, they multiply by 10 and di-  
vide by 3: to turn dollars into pounds, they multiply by  
3 and divide by ten. Thoſe in Virginia who live near to  
Carolina, where the dollar is 8/ or 5; of a pound, learn  
the operation of that ſtate, which is a multiplication by 4,  
and diviſion by io, et e converſo. Thoſe who live near  
Maryland, where the dollar is 76 or 5 of a pound, multi-  
  
  
„  
  
ply by; and divide by 8, or e converſo. All theſe ope-  
rations are eaſy, and have been found by experience not  
too much for the arithmetic of the people, When they  
have occaſion to convert their old unit into dollars, or  
the reverſe. |  
2. As to the unit of the Financier, in the ſtates where  
the dollar is &amp; of a pound, this unit will be . Irs con-  
verſion into the pound then will be by a multiplic ation by  
5 and diviſion by 24. In the ſtates where the dollar is  
of a pound, this unit willbe 33 of a pound, andthe ope-  
ration mult be to multiply by 5 and divide by 96, or e con-  
verſo, Where the dollar is &amp; of a pound, this unit will  
be g. The ſimplicity of the fraction, and of courſe the  
facility of converſion and reconverſion, is therefore againſt  
this unit, and in favour of the dollar, in every inſtance.  
The only advantage it has over the dollar is, that it will in  
every caſe expreſs our farthings Without a remainder;  
whereas, though the dollar and its decimals will do this  
in many caſes, it will not in all. But, even in theſe, by  
extending your notation one figure further, to wit, to  
thouſandths, you approximate to perfect accuracy within  
leſs than the t o thouſandih part of a dollar, an atom in  
money Which every one would neglect. Againſt this  
ſingle inconvenience the other advantages of the dollar  
are more than ſufficient to preponderate.---This unit will  
  
  
deavour to eſtimate its value by comparing it with a  
pound, or with a dollar, the units they now nn, they  
of courſe lets  
accommodated to their comprehenſion and habits than the  
dollar. Indeed the probability is that they could never  
be led to compute in it generally. |  
The Financier ſuppoſes that the 55; of a dollar is nor  
ſufficiently ſmall — the poor are purchaſers or ven-  
ders. If it is not, make a ſmaller coin. But J ſuſpect  
that it is ſmall enough. Let us examine facts, in coun-  
tries where We are acquainted with them. In Virginia,  
where our towns are few, ſmall, and of courſe their de-  
mand for neceſſaries very limited, we have never yet been  
  
141  
able to introduce a copper coin at all. The ſmalleſt coin  
which any body will receive there is the half bir, or n of  
a dollar. In thoſe ſtates where the towns ate larger and  
more populous, a-more habitual barter for ſmall wants  
has called for a copper coin 5; or 5 or 5; of a dollar.  
In England where the towns are many and populous, and  
| where ages of experience have matured the conveniencies  
of intercourſe, they have found that ſome wants may be  
ſupplied for a farthing, or 7 of a dollar, and they have  
accommodated à coin to this want. This buſineſs is eyi-  
dently progreſſive, In Virginia we are far behind. In  
ſome other ſtates they are farther advanced, to wit, to  
the appreciation of =, =, Tag of a dollar, To this moſt  
advanced ſtate then I accommodated my ſmalleſt coin in  
the decimal arrangement as a money of payment, cor-  
reſponding with the money of account. I have no doubt  
the time will come when a ſmaller coin will be called  
for. When it comes, let it be made. Ir will probably  
be the half of the copper I propoſe, that is to ſay —— or  
oo of a dollar, this being nearly the farthing of Eng-  
  
land. But it will be time enough to make it when the  
people shall be ready to receive it.  
  
OY  
  
My propoſition then is that our notation of money shall  
be — os deſcending ad libitum of rhe perſon noting 3  
that the unit of this notation shall be a dollar, that coins  
Shall be accommodated to it from ten dollars to the hun-  
dredth of a dollar; and that to ſer this on foot, the reſo-  
lutions be adopted which were propoſed in the Notes, or-  
  
ly ſubſtituting an enquiry into the fineneſs of the coins,  
in lieu of an aſſay of them.

one unit, the other was not the English  
pound but the local pound. The coins  
of Spain and those of England were  
alike in embodying metallic value. The  
dollar of the one and the pound of  
twenty shillings of the other represented  
severally distinct values of silver. The  
same was true of the money of Portugal,  
of France, and of other European  
countries. They all had gold and silver  
coin, while the currency of America was  
  
a mere mode of expressing values. Mr.  
Jefferson, writing at the very time of  
which Mr. McMaster is speaking, says:  
  
They—the people of the United States—have  
now two units, which they use with equal facility,  
viz.: the pound of their respective state and the  
dollar. The first of these is peculiar to each state ;  
the second, happily, common to all. In each state  
the people have an easy rule of converting the pound  
of their state into dollars or dollars into pounds.  
  
This is clear and comprehensible.  
To the Virginian the two units were the  
Spanish dollar and the local pound,  
which was the equivalent of three anda  
third dollars. The English pound was  
no more a unit of value to him than the  
French crown was. The Virginia pound  
and the English pound had nothing in  
common but thename. Nowhere in the  
United States did the term pound, used  
by itself, mean the English pound. It  
always meant the pound of the state

The proportion, between .the values of  
gold and sliver is a mercantile problem  
altogether. It would be inaccurate to fix  
It by the popular exchanges of a half joe  
for eight dollars, a Louis for four French  
crowns, or five Louis for twenty-three dol­  
lars. The first of these would be to adopt  
the Spanish proportion between gold and  
silver; the second the French, the third a  
mere popular barter, wherein convenience  
is consulted more than accuracy.- The legal  
proportion in Spain is 16 for 1; In England,  
15V4 for 1; in France, 15 for-1. The Span­  
iards and English are found in experience  
to retain an overproportion of gold coins  
and to lose their silver. The French have  
a greater .proportion of silver. The differ­  
ence at market has been on the decrease.  
The financier states it at present at 14  
for 1. Just principles will lead us to disre­  
gard legal proportion altogether; to inquire  
Into the-market price of gold in the several  
countries with which we shall principally  
be connected in. commerce, and to take an  
average from them. Perhaps we might  
with safety lean to a proportion somewhat  
above par for gold; considering our neigh­  
borhood and the commerce with the sources  
of the coins and the tendency which the  
high price of gold in Spain has to draw  
thither all that of their mines, leaving sil­

the father of the decimal system in our  
coinage and his mathematical mind was  
searching for a unitthat would lend  
Itself readily to that system. &quot;In fixing  
the unit of money,&quot; he said, &quot;it was  
Important that the parts and multiples  
of the unit be in an easy proportion to  
each other, so as to facilitate the money

&quot;The unit or dollar is a known coin  
and the mo-t familiar of all to the

commerce, too, will bring us more of

‘‘The unit or dollar is a known coin and the most  
fumiliar of. all to the mind of the people. ‘It is al-  
ready adopted from South to North, has identified  
our currency, and, therefore, happily offers itself  
as a unit already introduced. Our public debt, our  
reguisitions, and their apportionments have given  
it actual and long possession of the place of unit.  
The course of our commerce, too, will bring us  
more of this than any other forelgn coin, and  
therefore renders it more worthy of attention.”  
  
Further on he says: ‘“‘If we determine that a.  
  
dollar shall be our unit we must then say with _  
  
precision what a dollar is.’’  
  
And then, again, on page 442, he says “* The  
quantity of fine silver which shall constitute the  
unit being settled, and the proportion of the value  
of goid to that of silver, a table should be formed  
from the assay before suggested ciassing the sev-  
eral foreign coins according to their fineness.’’

all the time contended that the ratio be­  
tween the metals was purely u mercan­  
tile problem. Said Jefferson :  
&quot;The proportion between the value- of  
gold and silver is a mercantile problem  
altogether. The legal proportion in  
Spain is Hi for 1 ; in England, ló&#x27;.j fori ;  
in France, 15 for 1. Just principles will  
lead us to disregard legal proportions  
altogether;&quot; to inquire into the market  
price of go. d in the several countries  
with which we shall be principally con­

sources of the coins and the tendency

Next came the following quotation

same po.-hion. Mr Benion said :

to facilitate the money arithmetic; and  
third, that the unit and its parts or di­

some of the known coins as that they  
may be of easy adoption for the peo­

JEFFERSON&#x27;» SOUND DOCTRINE  
Let us quote from Jefferson, the  
father of tbe Democratic party. He  
said In epposing the Morris scheme  
before congress in 1782:  
&quot;J ust principles will lead us to disre­  
gard legal proportions altogether to in­  
quire into the market price of trold in  
the several countries with which we  
shall be principally connected in com­  
merce, and to take an average from  
them. Perhaps we might well and  
safely lean to a proportion somewhat  
above par for gold, considering our  
neighborhood and commerce with the  
sources of the coins, and the tendency  
which the high price of gold in Spain  
has to draw thither all that of their  
mines, leaving silver principally for  
our and other market«.

The proportion between the values of  
gold and silver is a mercantile problem  
altogether.. It would be inaccurate to fix it  
by the popular exchanges of a half Joe for  
eight dollars, a Louis for four French  
crowns, or five Louis for twenty-three dol-  
lars. The first of these would be to adopt  
the Spanish proportion between gold. and  
silver; the second, the French; the third, a  
mere popular barter where convenience is  
consulted more than accuracy. The legal  
proportion in Spain is 16 to 1; in England,  
15% for 1; in France, 15 for 1. The Spaniards  
and English are found in experience to re-  
tain an overproportion of gold coins and to  
lose their silver. The French havea greater  
proportion of silver. The difference in  
market has been on the decrease. The  
Financier states it at present as at 14 for 1.  
Just principles will lead us to disregard legal  
  
&quot;proportions altogether; to inquire into the  
  
market price of gold in the several countries  
with which we shall principally be connected  
in commerce and to take an average trom

other markets. It is not impossible that 15  
for 1 may be found an eligible proportion.”

and fixed the ratio of 15 to 1 in 1792, and  
the effect of that ratio, and the other ra­  
tio of 16 to 1 adopted in 15.14, upon the  
circulation of gold and silver in the  
United Statps. The words of Jefferson  
relating to the adoption cf the ratio of  
  
15 to 1, as quoted by Mr. Harris, are as  
folows:  
&quot;The proportion between the value of  
gold ami silver is a mercantile prob­  
lem altogether; just principles will lead  
us to disregard legal proportions alto­  
gether to inquire Into the market price  
of gold In the several countries with  
which we shall lie principally connected  
in commerce, and to take an average  
from them; perhaps we might with  
safety lean to a proportion somewhat  
above par with gold. Considering our  
neighborhood and commerce with the  
sources of the coins and the tendency  
which the high price ot gold ln Spain.  
16 to 1. has to draw thither that of all  
their mines, leaving silver prlnelpally  
for other markets, it is not imposible  
that 15 to 1 may be found an eligible  
proportion.&quot;  
In reply. Col. Berry said that &quot;Mr.  
Harris made much of what Jefferson  
,said about disregarding the legal pro­  
portions and inquiring Into the market  
price of gold for the purpose nf fixing  
the ratio, but disregarded entirely the  
much more significant words which fol­  
  
lew, suggesting that this Country might  
with safety &quot;lean to a proportion (for  
silver) Somewhat above par with gold.&quot;  
the high price of gold in Spain, at its  
ratio of 16 to 1 tending to draw thither  
that (the gold) of all its mines, leaving  
silver principally for other markets.  
Mr. Harris not only disregards the must  
significant portions of what Jefferson  
said, but the still more significant thins  
that he did.  
&quot;At the time that Jefferson said these  
things there existed in Europe the fol­

gether. (Then follows a comparison pf the  
ratios of the leading nations.) Just princi­  
ples will lead us to disregard legal propo­  
sitions altogether; to inquire Into the mar­  
ket price of gold in the several countries  
with which we .shall principally be con­  
nected in commerce and to take an average  
from them. Perhaps we might lean to a  
proposition somewhat above par for gold,  
considering our neighborhood and com­  
merce with the sources of the coins and  
the tendency which the high price of gold  
in Spain has to draw thither all that of  
their mines, leaving sliver principally for  
our and other markets. It Is not Impossible  
that 13 to 1 may be found an eligibleproportion-Later  
the official financier, Robert Mor­  
ris, informed Mr. Jefferson that the ratio  
of 13 to 1 was not a true mercantile propor­  
tion, whereat the latter wrote as follows:  
I observed In the preceding notes that the  
true proportion of value between gold and  
silver was a mercantile problem altogether,  
and that perhaps 13 to 1 might be found an  
eligible proportion. The financier Is so gocd  
as to inform me rbat this would be higher  
than the market would justify. Confident  
of his better information, on this subject,  
I recede from that idea.  
Why was Jefferson so eager to ascertain  
the exact mercantile ratio between gold  
and silver? Because he knew, as all sub­  
sequent experience has demonstrated, that  
to adopt any other ratio than the mercan­  
tile one as the basis of money values would  
deprive the country of the metal which was  
undervalued, and that It would be forced  
to a monometallism of the overvalued met
