to you first to have a model made of about 3. I. to the foot, or ¼ the real dimensions, and to have two blocks, the 1st. of which, after taking out the pyramidal piece, &amp; sawing in crosswise above &amp; below, should be preserved in that form, to instruct workmen in making the  large &amp; real one. the 2d. block may be carried through all the operations, so as to present the form of the mould board complete. if I had an opportunity of sending you a model I would do it. it has been greatly approved here, as it has been before by some very good judges at my house, where I have used it for 5. years with entire approbation.  
Mr. New shewed me your letter on the subject of the patent, which gave me an opportunity of observing what you said as to the effect with you of public proceedings, and that it was not unusual now to estimate the separate mass of Virginia and N. Carolina, with a view to their separate existence. it is true that we are compleatly under the saddle of Massachusets &amp; Connecticut, and that they ride us very hard, cruelly insulting our feelings as well as exhausting our strength and substance. their natural friends, the three other Eastern states, join them from a sort of family pride, and they have the art to divide certain other parts of the Union, so as to make use of them to govern the whole. this is not new. it is the old practice of despots to use a part of the people to keep the rest in order. and those who have once got an ascendancy, and possessed themselves of all the resources of the nation, their revenues and offices, have immense means for retaining their advantages. but our present situation is not a natural one. the body of our countrymen is substantially republican through every part of the union. it was the irresistable influence &amp; popularity of Genl. Washington played off by the cunning of Hamilton which turned the government over to antirepublican hands, or turned the republican members chosen by the people into anti-republicans. he delivered it over to his successor in this state, and very untoward events since, improved with great artifice, have produced on the public mind the impression we see. but still, I repeat it, this is not the natural state. time alone would bring round an order of things more correspondent to the sentiments of our constituents. but are there not events impending which will do it within a few months? the invasion of England, the public and authentic avowal of sentiments hostile to the leading principles of our constitution. the prospect of a war in which we shall stand alone, landtax, stamp-tax, increase of public debt &amp;c. be this as it may, in every free &amp; deliberating society, there must from the nature of man be opposite parties, &amp; violent dissensions &amp; discords; and one of these for the most part must prevail over the other for a longer or shorter time. perhaps this party division is necessary to induce each to watch &amp; debate to the people the proceedings of the other. but if on a temporary superiority of the one party, the other is to resort to a scission of the union, no federal government can ever exist. if to rid ourselves of the present rule of Massachusets &amp; Connecticut, we break the union, will the evil stop there? suppose the N. England states  alone cut off, will our natures be changed? are we not men still to the South of that, &amp; with all the passions of men? immediately we shall see a Pennsylvania &amp; a Virginia party arise in the residuary confederacy, and the public mind will be distracted with the same party spirit. what a game too will the one party have in their hands by eternally threatening the other that unless they do so &amp; so, they will join their Northern neighbors. if we reduce our Union to Virginia &amp; N. Carolina, immediately the conflict will be established between the representatives of these two states, and they will end by breaking into their simple units. seeing therefore that an association of men who will not quarrel with one another is a thing which never yet existed, from the greatest confederacy of nations down to a town meeting or a vestry, seeing that we must have somebody to quarrel with, I had rather keep our New-England associates for that purpose, than to see our bickerings transferred to others. they are circumscribed within such narrow limits, &amp; their population so full, that their numbers will ever be the minority, and they are marked, like the Jews, with such a peculiarity of character, as to constitute from that circumstance the natural division of our parties. a little patience and we shall see the reign of witches pass over, their spells dissolve, and the people recovering their true sight, restore their government to it’s true principles. it is true that in the mean time we are suffering deeply in spirit, and incurring the horrors of a war, &amp; long oppressions of enormous public debt. but who can say what would be the evils of a scission and when &amp; where they would end? better keep together as we are, hawl off from Europe as soon as we can &amp; from all attachments to any portions of it, and if we feel their power just sufficiently to hoop us together, it will be the happiest situation in which we can exist. if the game runs sometimes against us at home, we must have patience, till luck turns, &amp; then we shall have an opportunity of winning back the principles we have lost. for this is a game where principles are the stake. better luck therefore to us all, and health happiness &amp; friendly salutations to yourself.

Jefferson penned his Resolutions—It is as follows :  
Thomas Jefferson to John Taylor.  
.... .. , “Philadelphia, June 1,17flS.  
Mr. New shewed me your letter on the subject or  
• lie patent which gave mo an opportunity of observing  
what you said as to the effect, with you, of public pro­  
ceedings, and that it was not unwise now to estimate  
the separate mass of Virginia and North Carolina, with  
a view to their separate cxis&#x27;enoe. It is true that we  
arc completely under the saddle of Massachusetts and  
Connecticut, and that they ride us very hard, cruelly in­  
stil mg our feelings, as well as exhausting our strength  
and subsistence. Their natural friends, the Mother eastern  
States join them from a sort of family pri.le, and they  
have the art to divide certain other parts of the Union  
so as to make use of them to govern the whole. Tills  
is not new; it is the old practice of despots to use a part  
o( tlie people to keep the rest in order. And those who  
Have once got an ascendancy and possessed themselves  
of all the resources of the nation, their revenues and of­  
fices, have immense means of retaining their advantage.  
Hut, our present situation is not a natural one. The  
republicans through every part of the Union say. that it  
was the irresistible influence and popularity of General  
W ashington played off hy the cunning of Hamilton  
which turned the government over to anti-republican  
hands,or turned the republicans chosen hy the people in -  
to anti-republicans lie delivered it over to his sttceea­  
sor m this State, and very untoward events,since improv­  
ed with groat artifice, have produced on the public mind  
the impression we see. Hut still, I repeat it, this is not

der of things more correspondent to the sentiments of  
which0* 7&quot;.?: Bf‘ are ,herc no impending

gland, the public and authentic avowal or sentiments,  
hostile o the leading principles of our constitution, the  
prospect of a war, in which we shall stand alone, land  
tax, stamp tax, increase of puhlic debt, &amp;c. He this as  
it may; in every free and deliberating society, there must,  
Irom the nature of man, lie opposite parties and violent  
dissensions and discords, and one of these, for the most  
part, must prevail over the other for a longer, or shorter  
tunc. Perhaps, this par y division is necessary to in­  
duce each to watch and debate to the people, the pro­  
ceedmgs of the other. Rut, if on a temporary supei i  
only of the one party, tin* other is to resort to a scission  
ol the Union, no federal government can ever exist. If  
to rid ourselves of the present rule of Massachusetts and  
Connecticut, we break the Union, will the evil stop  
there? Suppose the New England Slates alone cut off  
w ill our natures he changed? Are we nobinen still to the  
south of that, and with all the passions of iron? Imme­  
diately we shall see a Pennsylvania and a Virginia par­  
ty arise in the residuary confederacy, and the public  
mind will tic distracted with the same party spirit. What  
a game, too, will the one party have in their hnn.l* t,„  
  
eternally threatening the other, that unless they &lt;lo so  
nn«l so, they will join their northern neighbours. If we  
reduce our Union to Virginia and North Carolina imme­  
diately, the conflict will he established between the rc­  
presentaliyes of these two ‘t;i»es, and they will end, hv  
breaking info their simple units. Seeing, therefore,  
that an association of men who will not quarrel with one  
another, is a thing which never yet existed, from the  
greatest confederacy of nation-, down to a town meeting,

parties. A little patience, and we shall see the rei-M, rf  
witches pass over, thoir spells dissolved, and the people  
recovering their true sign, restoring their government to  
its true principles. It is true that in the meantime we are  
suffering deeply in spirit and incurring the horrors of a  
war, k long oppressions of enormous public debt. But who  
can say what would ho tin; evils of a scission, and when

are, haul off from Europe as soon as we can, and from  
all attachments to any portion- or it; and if they shew  
their power just sufficion&#x27;ly to hoop us together, it will

To John Taylor, June 1, ’99.—“Hut, if on a temporary  
superiority of the one party, the other is to resort to a  
scission of tlie Union, no federal government can ever ex­  
ist. If to rid ourselves of tlie present rule of Massachu­  
setts and Connecticut, we break tlie Union, will&#x27;tlio evil  
stop there? Suppose the New England Stales alone cut  
off, will our natures he changed? Are we not men still to  
the south of (fiat, and witli all tlie passions ot men? imme­  
diately, we shall see a Pennsylvania and a Virginia party  
arise in the residuary confederacy, and tlie public mind  
will be distracted with the same party spirit.”_“A little  
patience, and we shall see the reign of witches pass over,  
their spells dissolved, and the people recovering their true  
sight, restoring their government to its true principles.  
Ills true, that in tlie mean time, wo are suffering deeply  
in spirit, and Incurring the horrors of a war, and long op­  
pressions of enormous public debt. Hut who can say what  
would be (ho evils of a scission, and when and where they

achieved this great triumph for the Union !  
  
SECESSION.  
From an old number of the Southern Quarter­  
ly Review, the papers re-copy the following ex­  
tract from a letter by Mr. JelTerson to a distin­  
guished public man in Virginia, written in 1798:  
“But if,on a temporary superiority of the one party,  
the other is to resort to a secession from the Union, no  
Federal Government can ever exist. If, to rid our­  
selves of the present rule of Massachusetts and Con­  
necticut, we break the Union, will the evil stop there I  
Suppose the New England States alone cut off, will  
our nature be changed 1 Are we not men still to the  
south of that, and with all the passions of men 1 Im­  
mediately we shall see a Pennsylvania and a Virginia  
party arise in the residuary Confederacy, and the public  
mind will be distracted with the same party spirit.—  
What a game, too, will the one party have in their  
hands by eternallv threatening the other,that, unless  
theydoso and so, they will join their Northern neigh­  
bors! It we redact! our Union to Virginia and North  
Carolrua, immediately the conflict wrll ,tre established  
between the representatives of these two States, and  
they will end by breaking into their simple units. See­  
ing, therefore, that an association of men who will not  
quarrel with one another is a thing which never yet ex­  
isted, from the greatest confederacy of nations down to  
a town meeting or vestry; seeing that we have somebody  
to quarrel with, 1 had rather keep our New England as­  
sociates for that purpose, than to sec our bickerings  
transferred to others.

one of these, for the most part, must prevail  
over the other for a longer or shorter time.

duce each to watch and relate to the people tbo  
proceedings of the other. But, if on tempo­

They arc circumscribed within such narrow

Id every free and deliberating society there  
must, from the nature of man, be opposite par*  
ties, and violent dissensions and discords ; and  
one of these, for the most part; must prevail  
over the other for a longer cr shorter time.  
Perhaps this party division is necessary to in* ,  
duce each to watch and relate to the people the I  
proceedings of the other. But, if on tempera- j  
ry superiority of the one parly, the other is to  
resort to a scission of the Union, nofcdcral gov­  
ernment con ever exist. If to rid ourselves of  
the present rule of Massachusetts and Connec­  
ticut, we break the Union, will the evil s op

cut off, will our natures be changed? Are we  
not men still to the South ot that, and with all  
the pass-ions of men? Immediately, we shall  
see a Pennsylvania and a Virginia partv arise in  
the residuary confederacy, and the public mmd  
will be distracted with the same party spirit.  
What a game, too, will the one party have in

their Northern neighbors. If we reduce our  
Union to Virginia and North Carolina, immedi­  
ately the conflict will he established between the  
representatives of these two States, and thev  
will end by breaking into their simple units.  
Seeing, therefore, that an association of men  
who will cot quart el with one another is a thing  
which neveryet existed, from the greatest con­  
federacy of nations down to a town meeting of  
a vestry; seeing that we roust have somebody  
to quarrel with, 1 bad rather keep our New  
England associates for that purpose, than to  
fee our bickerings transferred 10 others. They  
are circumscribed within such narrow limits,  
and their population so full that their numbers  
will ever be the minority—and they are marked,  
like the Jews, with such a perversity of charac­  
ter, as to constitute, from that circumstance,  
the natural division of our parties. A i’.lle  
patience and we shall see the reign of witches  
pass over, their -pells dissolved and the people  
recovering their true sight, restoring their gov­  
ernment to its true principles. It Ist rue we are  
suffering deeply in spirit, and incurring li.e  
horrors of a war, acd long oppressions of enor­  
mous public dots. But who cun say tyhut would

interests in the new combination which has arisen among

tion would set towards those points where it could be  
most advantageously employed, leaving bare the borders  
which security most requires should be covered. Islands

He had said to this disunionist, on the first of  
June: ‘‘If, on a temporary superiority of the  
one party, the other is to resort to a scission of  
the Union, no Federal government can ever ex-  
ist. If, to rid ourselves of the present rule of  
Massachusetts and Connecticut, we break the  
Union, will the evil stop there? Suppose the  
New England States alone cut off, will our na-  
ture be changed? Are we not men still to the  
South of that, and with all the passions of men ?  
Immediately we shall see a Pennsylvania and a  
Virginia party arise in the residuary confederacy,  
and the public mind will be distracted with the  
same party-spirit. What a game, too, will the  
one party have in their hands, by eternally threat-  
ening the other that unless they do so and so they  
will join their Northern neighbors! If we reduce  
our Union to Virginia and North Carolina, im-  
mediately the conflict will be established between  
the representatives of these two States, and they  
will end by breaking into their simple units........  
Better keep together as we are, haul off from  
Europe as soon as we can, and from all attach-  
ments to any portion of it. If the game runs  
sometimes against us at home, we must have  
patience till luck turns.”

A paragreph is going the rounds to the  
effect that Jefferson deprecated a separation  
of the southern states from New England,  
becaase it was better to quarrel with this sec-  
tion than among themeclves. We presume  
this statement is based on the following ex-  
tract of a letter written by Jefferson to John  
Taylor in 1708 &gt;—  
  
“Suppose the New England states alone  
cut off, will our nature be changed? Are we  
not men still to the south of that, with all the  
passions of men? Immediately we shall see  
a Pennsylvania party and a Virginia party  
  
public mind will be distracted by the same  
party spirit, Whata game too will the one  
party have in their hands, by eternally threat-  
ening the other that unless they do so and so,  
they will join their northern neighbors. If  
we reduce our Union to Virginie and North  
Carolina, immediately the conflict will be es-  
tablished between the representatives of these  
two states, and they will end by breaking  
into their simple units, Beoing, therefore,  
that an association of mea who will not quar-  
rel with one another is a thing which never  
yet existed, from the greatest confederacy of  
nations down to a town meeting or a vestry;  
seeing that we must have somebody to quarrel  
with, I had rather keep our New England  
associates for that purpose, than to see our  
bickerings transferred to others. They are  
circumscribed within such marrow limita, and  
their population is so full, that their numbers  
will ever be the minority, and they are mark-  
ed, like the Jews, with such a perversity of  
character, as to constitute from that ciroum-  
stance, the natural division of our parties.”

which never yet existed, from the great-
