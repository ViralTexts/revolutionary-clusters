I believe I may, with great truth affirm, that no Man perhaps since the first Institution of Armys ever commanded one under more difficult Circumstances than I have done—to enumerate the particulars would fill a volume—many of my difficulties and distresses were of so peculiar a cast that in order to conceal them from the Enemy, I was obliged to conceal them from my friends, indeed from my own Army thereby subjecting my Conduct to interpretations unfavourable to my Character—especially by those at a distance, who could not, in the smallest degree, be acquainted with the Springs that govern’d it—I am happy however to

said he, ‘‘the Lord only knows.” Cramped and  
confined in the over-crowded ships the Tories  
suffered severely. Some enlisted as seamen, and  
all paid dear for their desertion of the cause of  
freedom. Washington was far from being pained  
to hear of their miserable condition, and in de-  
scribing it said, ‘‘Two have done what a greater  
number ought to have done long ago, committed  
suicide.” These misguided men had supposed  
the British army invincible. ‘When the order  
issued therefore for embarking the troops, no  
electric shock, no explosion of thunder, in a  
word, not the last trump could have struck them  
with greater consternation.”
