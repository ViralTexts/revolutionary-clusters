[1 Jan. 1795]  
  
By the President of the United States of America.  
A Proclamation  
When we review the calamities which afflict so many other Nations, the present condition of the United States affords much matter of consolation and satisfaction. Our exemption hitherto from foreign war, an increasing prospect of the continuance of  
  
that exemption, the great degree of internal tranquillity we have enjoyed, the recent confirmation of that tranquillity by the suppression of an insurrection which so wantonly threatened it, the happy course of our public affairs in general, the unexampled prosperity of all classes of our Citizens—are circumstances which peculiarly mark our situation with indications of the Divine Beneficence towards us. In such a state of things it is, in an especial manner, our duty as a people, with devout reverence and affectionate gratitude, to acknowledge our many and great obligations to Almighty God and to implore him to continue and confirm the blessings we experience.  
Deeply penetrated with this sentiment I George Washington President of the United States do recommend to all Religious Societies and Denominations and to all persons whomsoever within the United States to set apart and observe thursday the nineteenth day of February next as a day of public Thanksgiving and prayer; and on that day to meet together and render their sincere and hearty thanks to the great ruler of Nations for the manifold and signal mercies, which distinguish our lot as a Nation; particularly for the possession of Constitutions of Government which unite and by their union establish liberty with order, for the preservation of our peace foreign and domestic, for the seasonable controul which has been given to a spirit of disorder in the suppression of the late insurrection, and generally for the prosperous course of our affairs public and private; and at the same time humbly and fervently to beseech the kind author of these blessings graciously to prolong them to us—to imprint on our hearts a deep and solemn sense of our obligations to him for them—to teach us rightly to estimate their immense value—to preserve us from the arrogance of prosperity and from hazarding the advantages we enjoy by delusive pursuits—to dispose us to merit the continuance of his favors, by not abusing them, by our gratitude for them, and by a correspondent conduct as citizens and as men—to render this Country more and more a safe and propitious asylum for the unfortunate of other Countries—to extend among us true and useful knowledge—to diffuse and establish habits of sobriety, order, morality, and piety and finally to impart all the blessings we possess, or ask for ourselves, to the whole family of mankind.  
In Testimony whereof I have caused the Seal of the United  
  
States of America to be affixed to these presents and signed the same with my hand. Done at the City of Philadelphia the First day of January one thousand seven hundred and ninety five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the nineteenth.

By vraz PRESIDENT or Tue UNITED  
STATES or AMERICA.  
WI-IEN we review the calamities,  
which affli&amp; so many other nations,  
the present condition of the United States  
affords much matter of consolation and  
fatisfaQion. .~ Our exemption hitherto  
from foreign war—an encicauag prolpect  
of the continuance of that exemption—  
the great degree of internal tranquility we  
bave enjoyed—the recent confirmation of  
that tranquility by the suppression of an  
infurre@ion, which so wantonly threatened  
it—the happy course of public affairs in  
general—the unexampled prosperity of all  
clafles of our citizens ; arecircumftances,  
which peculiarly mark our situation with  
indications of the divine beneficence to­  
wards us. In such a state of things, it is,  
in an especial manner; our duty as a peo­  
ple, with devout revererice and affetionate  
gratitude to acknowledge our many and  
great obligations to Almighty God, and  
to implore him to continue and confirm  
the bleflings we experience.  
Deeply penetrated with this sentiment,  
I, GEORGE WASHINGTON, President  
of the United States, do recommend to all  
religious societies and denominations, and  
to.all persons whomsoever, within the U­  
nited States, to set apart, and observe,  
T harfday; the nineteentl&gt; day of February next,  
as a day of pablic Thank(giving and pray­  
er : and, on that day, to meet together  
and render their sincere and hearty thanks  
to the great Ruler of nations, for the  
manifold and signal mercies, which dif­  
tinguith our lot as a nation, particularly,  
far the poffeflion of coaftitutions of gov­  
ernment, which unite, and, by their union,  
eftablith liberty with order ; for the pre­  
servation of peace, foreign and domef&#x27;tJic 3  
for the seasonable control, which has been  
given to a spirit of disorder, in the sup­  
pression of the late infurreftion ; and,  
generally, for the prosperous course of our  
affairs, public and private ; and, at the  
fame time, humbly and fervently to be­  
seech the kind Author of these bleflings,  
graciously to prolong them to us—to im­  
print,;on our hearts, a deep and solemn  
sense of our obligations to him for them  
~—to teach us; rightly to estimate their  
immense value—to preserve us from the  
arrogance of prosperity, and from hazard.  
ing the advantages we enjoy, by delusive  
pursuits—to dispose us to merit the con­  
tinuance of his favors, by not abusing  
them, by our gratitude for them, and by  
a correspondent condud, as citizens and  
as men—to renderthis country, more and

When we teview the calamities which afflict ?o many  
other nations, the present condition of the United Statea  
affords much matter of consolation and satislaction. Our  
exemption hitherto from foreign war; an increasing pros­  
pect ol the continuance of that exemption; the great de­  
gree of internal tranquillity we have enjoyed ; the recent  
confirmation of that tranquillity by the Hippression of an  
insurrection which so wantonly threatened it; the happy  
course of our public affairs in general; the unexampled  
prosperity of all classes of our citizens?are circumstances  
which peculiarly mark our situation with indications of  
the Divine beneficence towards us In such ? stats ol  
things it is, in an especial manner, our duty as a people,  
with devout reverence and affectionate gratitude, to  
acknowledge our many and great obligations to Almighty  
God, and to implore him to continue and confirm the  
blessings we experience.  
Deeply penetrated with this sentiment, I, George  
Washington, President of the United Statea, do recom­  
mend to all religious societies and denominations, and to  
all penone whomsoever within the United States, to set  
apart aod ofceerve Thursday, the nineteenth day of Feb­  
  
maty next, iu a tlay of public thanksgiving and p&gt;??,  
and oil that day to meet togethei uad render their muter*  
and hearty thanks to the Great Unlet of Nation* (or the  
inauifold and signal mercies which distinguish our lot as  
a natiou?particularly for the possession of sonstitutions  
of government which mute, and by their union Utah&#x27;  
lish, liberty with order; for the preservation of oar peace,  
foreign and domestic; for the seasonable control which  
has been given to a spirit of disorder in the suppression of  
the lefts insurrection; and generally for the prosperous  
course of our affairs; public and private : and, at the same  
time, humbly 2nd fervently to beseech the kiud Author  
of these blessings graciously to proloug theui to us; to  
imprint on our hearts a deep and solemn sense of our obli­  
gations to Him for them; to teach us rightly to estimate  
their iin.riense value; to preserve us from the arrogance  
of prosperty, and from hazarding the advsutages we en­  
joy by delosive pursuits; to dispose us to merit the con­  
tinuance of His favors by not abusing them, by our  
t gratitude for them, und by a correspondent conduct as

When we review the calamities which afflict so |  
many other nations, the present condition of the |  
United States affords much matter of conselation and |  
satisfaction. Qur exemption hitherto from foreign  
war, an increasing of the continuance of that |  
exemption, the great degree of internal tranquillity |  
we have enjoyed, the receat confirmation of that |  
tranquillity by the suppression of aninsurrection which |  
so wantonly threatened ii, the happy course of eur |  
public affairs in general, the unexampied prosperity  
of all classes of our citizens, are circumstances which  
peculiarly mark our situation with indications of the  
divine beneficence toward us. In such a state of  
things, it is, in an especial manner, our duty as a  
people, with deveut reverence and affectionate grat  
tude, to acknowledge our many and great obligations  
to Almighty Ged, and to implore him to continue and  
confirm the blessings we experience.  
  
Deeply penetrated with this sentiment, I, Gzerer  
Wasuincton, President of the United States, do rec-  
ommend to all religious societies and denominations,  
and to all persons whomsoever withia the United  
States, to set apart and observe Thursday, the nine-  
teenth day of February next, as a day ef Public |  
Thavkegiving and Prayer; and on that day to meet

to the Great Ruler of Nations for the manifold and  
signal mercies which distinguish our lot as a nation :  
Particularly for the possession of constitutions of gov-  
ernment which unite, and, by their unien, establish  
liberty with order ; for the prescrvation of our peace,  
foreign and domestic; for the seasonable eontrol  
which has teen given to a spirit of disorder In the  
suppression of the late insurrection; and generally  
for the prosperous course of our affairs, public and  
private ; and, at the same time, humbly and fervently |

THE FIRST THANESGIVING.  
  
Copy of ProclamationjIssued by President  
George Washington.  
Rev. W. N. Bacon of Bridport read the  
following at his recent Thanksgiving Day  
services:  
The following is the first national pro­  
clamation issued by George Washington,  
first president of the United States. It  
is dated Jan. I, 1795, and will be read  
with interest at this time, especially in  
view of the fact that some persons would  
have us believe that a national Thanks­  
giving proclamation is a recent invention  
in our country:  
PROCLAMATION.  
When we review the calamities which af.  
flict so many other nations, the present con­  
dition of the United States affords much mat­  
ter of consolation and satisfaction. Our ex­  
emption hitherto from foreign war, an in.  
creasing prospect of the continuance of that  
exemption, the great degree of internal  
tranquillity we have enjoyed, the recent con-  
firmation of that tranquillity by the suppres  
sion of an insurrection which so wantonly  
threatened it, the happy course of our public  
  
affairs in general, the unexampled prosperity  
of all classes of our citizens, are circum.  
  
stances which peculiarly mark, our situation  
with indications of the divine beneficence to­  
ward us. In such a state of things it is in an  
  
especial manner our duty as a people, with  
devout reverence and affectionate grat tude,  
to acknowledge our many an d great obliga­  
tions to Almighty God, and to impiore Him  
  
to continue and confirm the blessings we ex­  
perienced  enetrated with this sentiment, i,  
George Washington, President of the United  
tates, do recommend to all religious so-  
cieties and denominations, and to all persons  
whomsoever, within the United States to set  
apart and observe Thursday, the 19th day of  
February next, as a day of public thanksgiy  
ing and prayer, and on that day to meet to.  
gether and render sincere and hearty thanks  
to the great Ruler of nations for the manifold  
and signal mercies which distinguish our lot  
as a nation: particularly for the possession of  
constitutions of Government which unite and,  
by their union, established liberty with order,  
for the preservation of our peace, foreign and  
  
domestic; for the reasonable control which  
has been given to a spirit of disorder in the  
suppression of the late insurrection, and  
generally for the prosperous condition of our  
affairs, public and private, and at the same  
time humbly and fervently beseech the kind  
Author of these blessings graciously to pro.  
long them to us; to imprint on our hearts a  
deep and solemn sense of our obligations to  
Him for them; to teach us rightly to estimate  
their immense value; to preserve us from the  
arrogance of prosperity, and from hazarding  
the advantages we enjoyed by delusive pur­  
suits, to dispose us to merit the continuance  
of His favors by not abusing them, by our  
gratitude for them, and by a corresponding  
conduct as citizens and as men to render this  
country more and more a safe and propitious  
asylum for the unfortunate of other countries;  
to extend among us true and useful know.  
ledge; to diffuse and establish habits of  
sobriety, order, morality, and piety, and fin-  
ally to im part all the blessings we possess or  
ask for ourselves to the whole family of man-  
kind.  
In testimony whereof, I have caused the  
seal of the United States of America to be af.  
fixed to these presents, and signed the same  
with my hand. Done at the city of Philadel­
