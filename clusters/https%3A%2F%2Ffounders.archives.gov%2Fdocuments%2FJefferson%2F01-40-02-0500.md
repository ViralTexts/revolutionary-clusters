your party being small, it is . to be ex­  
pected that you will, encounter considerable  
dangers from the Indian Inhabitants. Should  
you escape those dangers and reach the  
Pacific Ocean. jxu may find it Imprudent  
to hazard a return the same way, and be  
forced to seek a passage round by sea in  
such vessels as you may find on the West­  
ern coast. But you will be without money,  
without clothes &amp; other necessaries; as a  
sufficient supply cannot be carried with  
you from hence. Your resource in , that  
case can only be in the credit of the US.,  
for which purpose I hereby au­  
thorize youi to draw -on the  
Secretaries of . State, of the Treas­  
ury, of War &amp; of .the Navy of the US.,  
according as you. may find your draughts  
will be most&#x27; negotiable,; for the purpose  
of obtaining money or necessaries for your­  
self &amp; your men; and I solemnly pledge  
the faith of the United States that these  
draughts shall be paid punctually at the  
date they are made payable. I also ask  
of the consuls, agents, merchants, &amp; citi  
zens of any nation with which we have in  
tercourse or amity to furnish you with  
those supplies which your necessities may  
call for. assuring them of honorable and  
prompt retribution and our consuls Inforeign-parts  
whence -you may happen -to be.  
are hereby instructed &amp; required to be  
aiding &amp; assisting to you in whatsoever  
may be necessary for procuring your re  
turn back to the United States and to give  
more entire satisfaction &amp; confidence to  
those who may be disposed to aid you. I

Statejof America, have written this let­  
ter of general credit for you with my own
