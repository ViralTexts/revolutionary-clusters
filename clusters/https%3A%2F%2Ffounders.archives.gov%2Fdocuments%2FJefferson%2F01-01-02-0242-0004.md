And, if any Writ or process shall be executed so late that the Sherif or other officer hath not reasonable Time to return the same before the day of appearance thereto, and an Alias, Pluries, Attachment or other Process be awarded thereupon, the sherif shall not execute such subsequent Process, but shall return the first process by him executed, on which there shall be the same proceedings, as if it had been returned in due time.  
In all actions or suits, which may be commenced against the Governor of this Commonwealth, any member of the privy Council or the sherif of any County, during his continuance in office, instead of the Ordinary process, a summons shall Issue to the sherif or other proper officer, reciting the cause of Action and summoning such Defendant to appear and answer the same on the proper return day in the next General Court; and, if such Defendant being summoned or a Copy left at his house ten days, before the return day, shall not appear to Answer the same on Attachment shall be awarded against his Estate, and thereafter, the proceedings in the suit shall be in like manner, as is directed in case of an Attachment awarded upon the Sherifs returning Non est Inventus on Ordinary process.  
In all actions to recover the penalty for breach of any penal Law, not particularly directing special Bail to be given in Actions of Slander, Trespass, Assault and Battery, Actions on the Case for Trover or other wrongs, and all other personal actions, except such as shall be hereinafter particularly mentioned, the Plaintiff or his Attorney shall, on pain of having his suit Dismissed with Costs, indorse on the Original Writ or subsequent Process the true species of Action, that the sherif, to whom the same is directed, may be thereby informed whether Bail is to be demanded on the execution thereof; and, in the cases before mentioned, the sheriff may take the Engagement of any Attorney practising in the General Court indorsed upon the Writ that he will appear for the Defendant or Defendants, and such appearance shall be entered with the Clerk in the office on the second day after the end of the Court to which such process is returnable; which is hereby declared to be the appearance day in all process returnable to any day of the Court next  preceding. And every Attorney, failing to enter an appearance according to such engagement, shall forfeit to the Plaintiff fifty shillings for which Judgment shall be immediately entered and Execution may Issue thereupon. Provided always that any Judge of the said Court, in Actions of Trespass, Assault and Battery, Trover and Conversion, and, in actions on the case, where, upon proper affidavit or affirmation, as the case may be, it shall appear to him proper that the Defendant or Defendants should give appearance Bail, may, and he is hereby authorised to direct such Bail to be taken by indorsement on the Original Writ or subsequent process, and every sherif shall Govern himself accordingly.  
In all actions of Debt, founded on any Writing Obligatory, Bill or note in Writing for the Payment of Money or Tobacco, all actions of Covenant or Detinue, in which cases the true species of action shall be endorsed on the Writ, as before directed, appearance Bail is to be required, the sheriff shall return on the Writ the name of the Bail by him taken, and a Copy of the Bail Bond to the Clerks office, before the day of appearance; and, if the Defendant shall fail to appear accordingly, or shall not give special Bail, being ruled thereto by the Court, the Bail for appearance may defend the suit and shall be subject to the same Judgment and recovery as the Defendant might or would be subject to, if he had appeared and given special Bail. And if the sherif shall not return Bail, and a Copy of the Bail Bond, or the Bail returned shall be judged insufficient by the Court and the Defendant shall fail to appear or give special Bail, if ruled thereto, in such case the sherif may have the like liberty of defence and shall be subject to the same recovery, as is provided in the case of appearance Bail; and, if the sherif depart this life before Judgment be confirmed against him, in such case, the Judgment may be Confirmed against his Executors or Administrators, or, if there shall not be a Certificate of Probat or Administration granted, then it may be confirmed against his Estate, and a Writ of Fieri Facias may, in either case, be Issued. But the Plaintiff shall object to the sufficiency of the Bail, during the sitting of the Court, to which the writ is returnable, or in the office at the first or second rule day after that Court and, at no time thereafter. And all questions concerning the sufficiency of Bail so objected to in the office shall be determined by the Court on the eighth day of the succeeding Court and, in all cases where the Bail shall be Adjudged insufficient and Judgment entered against the sherif he shall have the same remedy against the Estate of the Bail as against the Estate of the Defendant. Also that every Judgment entered in the office  against a Defendant and Bail or against a Defendant and Sherif shall be set aside, if the Defendant upon the eighth day of the succeeding Court shall be allowed to appear without Bail, put in good Bail, being ruled so to do, or surrender himself in Custody and shall Plead to Issue immediately; on which eighth day the Court shall also regulate all other Proceedings in the office, during the preceding Vacation and rectify any mistakes or errors, which may have happened therein.  
In every case, where Judgment shall be confirmed against any Defendant or Defendants, and his Bail or the Sherif, his Executors, Administrators or Estate, as aforesaid; the Court, upon a Motion of such Bail or of such Sherif, his Executors or Administrators, or any other person on behalf of his Estate may Order an Attachment against the Estate of such Defendant or Defendants returnable to the next succeeding Court and, upon the execution and return of such attachment the Court shall order the Estate seised or so much thereof as will be sufficient to satisfy the Judgment and Costs and all Costs, accruing on the Attachment, to be Sold, as Goods taken in execution upon a fieri facias and out of the money such Judgment and all Costs shall be satisfied, and the surplus, if any restored to the Defendant or Defendants when required.  
Any Judge of the said Court, when the Court is not sitting, or any Justice of the peace authorized for that purpose by the said Court, may take a recognizance of Special Bail, in any Action therein depending, which shall be taken de bene esse and shall be transmitted by the person taking the same, before the next succeeding General Court to the Clerk of the said Court to be filed with the Papers in such Action, and if the Plaintiff or his Attorney shall except to the sufficiency of Bail so taken, notice of such exception shall be given to the Defendant or his Attorney at least ten days previous to the day on which such exception shall be taken. And if such Bail shall be judged insufficient by the Court the Recognizance thereof shall be discharged and such proceedings shall be had as if no such Bail had been taken. Every Special Bail may surrender the Principal before the Court where the suit hath been or shall be depending at any time either before or after Judgment shall be given; and thereupon the Bail shall be discharged and the Defendant or Defendants shall be Committed to the Custody of the Sherif or Gaoler attending such Court, if the Plaintif or his Attorney shall desire the same; or such special Bail may discharge himself or herself by surrendering the principal or principals to the Sherif of the County, where the Original Writ was served, and such sherif shall  receive such Defendant or Defendants and Commit him, her or them to the Gaol of his County, and shall give a receipt for the Body or Bodies of such Defendant or Defendants, which shall be by the Bail forthwith transmitted to the Clerk of the Court, where the suit is or was depending. When such render, after Judgment, shall be to the sherif, he shall keep such Defendant or Defendants in his Custody in the same manner and subject to the like Rules, as are provided for Debtors committed in Execution, during the space of twenty days; unless the Creditor, his Attorney, or Agent, shall sooner consent to his, her or their Discharge; the Bail shall give immediate notice of such render to the Creditor his Attorney or Agent; and if within the said twenty days, such Creditor his Attorney or Agent shall not, in Writing, charge the Debtor or Debtors in Execution, he, she or they shall be forthwith discharged out of Custody, but the Plaintif or Plaintifs may nevertheless afterwards sue out an Execution either against the Bodies or Estates of such Debtor or Debtors.  
When the Sherif or other proper officer shall return on any Original or mesne process that he hath taken the Body of any Defendant and committed him to Prison for want of Appearance Bail, the Plaintif may proceed, and the Defendant make his defence, in like manner, as if his appearance had been entered and accepted, but such Defendant shall not be discharged out of Custody until he shall put in good Bail or the Plaintif shall be ruled by Court to accept an appearance without Bail, and, where any Defendant, after appearance entered, shall be confined in prison, the Plaintif may file his Declaration, give a Rule to plead and deliver Copies of such Declaration and rule to the Defendant or his attorney; and, if the Defendant shall fail to enter his plea within two months after receiving such Declaration and Notice, the Plaintif may have Judgment by Default as in other cases.  
Where the Sherif or other proper officer shall return on any Writ of Capias to answer in any civil Action, that the Defendant is not found within his Bailiwick, the Plaintif may either sue out an alias or a Pluries Capias until the Defendant be arrested or a Testatum Capias, where he shall be removed into another County, or may, at his Election, sue out an Attachment against the Estate of the Defendant to force an appearance. And, if the Sherif or other officer shall return that he hath Attached any Goods, and the Defendant shall not appear and replevy the same by entering his appearance and giving Special Bail, in case he shall be ruled so to do, the Plaintif shall file his Declaration and be entitled to a Judgment  for his Debt or Damages &amp; Costs, which Judgment shall be final in all Actions of Debt founded on any Specialty, Bill or Note in Writing ascertaining the Demand; and, in other cases, the Damages shall be settled by a Jury sworn to enquire thereof; the Goods Attached shall remain in the hands of the officer, till such final Judgment be entered, and then be Sold in the same manner, as Goods taken upon a Fieri Facias; and, if the Judgment shall not be thereby satisfied, the Plaintif may sue out Execution for the residue; and, in case more Goods be attached, than will satisfie the Judgment, the surplus shall be returned to the Defendant. On the Return of a Pluries Capias that the Defendant is not to be found the Court, instead of the Process to outlawry formerly used, may Order a Proclamation to be Issued, warning the Defendant to appear at a certain day therein to be named or that Judgment will be rendered against him, which Proclamation shall be Published on three successive Court days at the Door of the Court-house of the County, to which the last process was directed and also three Times in the Virginia Gazette; and, if the Defendant fails to appear, pursuant to such Proclamation, the same proceedings shall be had and the same Judgment given, as in other cases of Default. In the prosecution of all suits in the General Court the following rules shall be observed.  
The Plaintif shall file his Declaration in the Clerk’s office at the succeeding rule day after the Defendant shall have entered his appearance, or the Defendant may then enter a Rule for the Plaintif to declare; and, if he shall fail or neglect so to do at the succeeding Rule day, or shall at any Time fail to prosecute his suit, he shall be nonsuited and pay to the Defendant or Tenant, besides his Costs, One hundred and fifty pounds of Tobacco, where his place of abode is at the distance of twenty Miles or under from the place of holding the General Court; and, where it is more, five pounds of Tobacco for every mile above twenty. One month, after the Plaintiff hath filed his Declaration, he may give a Rule to plead with the Clerk, and, if the Defendant shall not plead accordingly, at the expiration of such Rule, the Plaintiff may enter Judgment by default for his Debt or Damages and Costs.  
All Rules to declare, plead, reply, rejoin or for other proceedings, shall be given regularly, from Month to Month, shall be entered in a Book to be kept by the Clerk for that purpose and shall be out on the succeeding Rule day.  
All Judgments by Default, for want of an Appearance, Special Bail or pleas as aforesaid, and Nonsuits or Dismissions obtained in  the office and not set aside on the eighth day of the succeeding General Court, shall be entered by the Clerk as of that day, which Judgment shall be final in Actions of Debt founded on any Specialty Bill or Note in Writing ascertaining the Demand, and, in all other cases the Damages shall be ascertained by a Jury to be impanel’d and sworn to enquire thereof as is hereinafter directed.  
In all such cases and other Judgments for Plaintiff or Defendant, the Clerk shall allow a Lawyer’s Fee in the Bill of Costs, if the party employed one, which fee, in real, personal or mixed actions, where the Title or Bounds of Land shall or may come in question, shall be five pounds or one thousand pounds of Tobacco, and, in all other Cases fifty shillings or five hundred pounds of Tobacco, at the election of the party Paying.  
No Plea in abatement or of Non est factum shall be admitted or received unless the party offering the same shall prove the truth thereof by affidavit or affirmation as the case may be; and where a plea in Abatement shall upon argument be Judged insufficient, the Plaintif shall recover full Costs to the Time of overruling such plea, a Lawyers fee only excepted. The Plaintif, in Replevin and the Defendant in all other actions may plead as many several matters whether of Law or Fact as he shall think necessary for his defence.  
In all Cases, where a Fine is laid on the Justices of any County Court or the Vestry of a Parish, one Action may be brought against all the Members jointly.  
Immediately, after the end of each General Court, the Clerk shall make a Transcript of the Record in each and every suit depending in the said Court, wherein an Issue is to be Tri

When any person not being a slave shall be charged, before a Justice of the Peace with any Criminal offence, which in the Opinion of such Justice ought to be examined into by the County Court, the said Justice shall take the Recognizance of all material Witnesses to appear before such Court and immediately by his Warrant Commit the person so Charged to the County Gaol, and moreover shall Issue his Warrant to the Sherif of the County requiring him to summon the Justices of the County to meet at their Court-house on a certain day, not less than five or more than Ten day’s after the date thereof, to hold a Court for examination of the Fact, which Court shall consider whether, as the case may appear to  them, the prisoner may be discharged from further prosecution, may be Tried in the County or must be tried in the General Court or Court of Assize; if they shall be of Opinion that the Fact may be tried in the County the prisoner shall be bound over to the next Grand Jury Court to be held for that County for Trial, or, upon refusing to give sufficient Bail, shall be remanded to the County Gaol, there to remain until such Court, or until he or she shall be Bailed. But if they shall be of Opinion that the Prisoner ought to be Tried in the General Court or Court of Assize they shall take the Depositions of the Witnesses and bind such as they shall think proper by recognizances to appear and give Evidence against such Criminal at his Trial; and, having remanded the Prisoner to Gaol, any two of the Justices, one being of the Quorum, by warrant under their hands and seals, shall direct the sherif or his Deputy to remove the prisoner and commit him to the Gaol of that assize Court, at which the Issues in civil cases for the County from whence he is removed are herein directed to be Tried, there to be safely kept until he or she be discharged by due course of Law. By virtue of which Warrant the sherif, as soon as may be, shall remove the Prisoner and deliver him or her with the Warrant to the keeper of the Assize Gaol, who shall receive and safely keep him or her accordingly.  
And for Enableing the Sherif safely to Convey and deliver such Prisoner the said two Justices by their Warrant shall empower him, as well within his County as without, to impress such and so many Men, Horses and Boats, as shall be necessary for the Guard and safe Conveyance of the Prisoner, proceeding therein as the Laws may direct in Cases of Impressing on other Occasions, and all persons are to pay due Obedience to such Warrant.  
Provided that, if such person shall in the Opinion of the Court be Bailable by Law, he or she shall not be removed within twenty days after the examining Court, but shall and may be admitted to Bail before any Justice of the same County within that Time or at any Time afterwards before any Judge of the General Court.  
When any person shall be so removed to be Tried for Treason or Felony, the Clerk of the County, from whence the Prisoner is removed, shall immediately after the Court held for his or her examination Issue a Writ of venire Facias to the Sherif of the County commanding him to summon twelve good and lawful Men, being Freeholders of the County, residing as near as may be to the place, where the Fact is alledged to have been Committed, to come before the Court of Assize, where the Prisoner is to be Tried at it’s  next session, and return a pannel of their names, which Freeholders or so many of them, as shall appear, not being challenged, together with so many other good and lawful Freeholders of the bystanders, as will make up the number twelve, shall be a lawful Jury for the Trial of such Prisoner.  
Every Venire man summoned and attending such Court of Assize shall have the same allowance for travelling and attendance as is herein before provided for Witnesses, to be paid by the Public.  
If any Person summoned as a Venire Man shall fail to attend accordingly, not having a reasonable excuse to be made at the time he should have appeared or at the next General Court or Court of Assize for that District, the Court of Assize may fine every such person not exceeding forty shillings or four hundred pounds of Tobacco for the use of the Commonwealth.  
If a Prisoner shall desire any Witnesses to be summoned for him or her to appear, either at the examining Court or on the Trial at the Assizes, the Clerk of the Assize or of the County Court, as the case may be, shall Issue Subpoena for such Witnesses, who being summoned and attending, shall have the like allowance for travelling and attendance and be subject to the same Penalty for failing to attend, as is provided for Witnesses in Civil Causes.  
The keepers of the respective Assize Gaols, by Order of any two Justices of the same County, may impress Guards for the safe keeping of all Prisoners in their Custody to be paid by the Public.  
The fee to the Sherif of the County and to the Assize Gaoler for keeping and Dieting any such Prisoner shall be one shilling per day and no more.  
Where the Criminal shall be Convicted and hath Estate sufficient to pay the Charges of Prosecution, the whole shall be paid out of such Estate, and the Public only made Chargeable where there is no such Estate or not sufficient to be found.  
The Sherif of each of the Counties of Accomack, Nansemond, York, Essex, Spotsylvania, Sussex, Charlotte, Bedford, Montgomerie, Powhatan, Culpeper, Albemarle, Augusta, Fairfax, Frederick, and Monongalia, Yohogania, for the Time being, shall before every meeting of the Court of assize in their respective Counties summon Twenty four Freeholders of the Counties Assigned to each Assize, qualified as the Laws require, for Grand Jurors to appear at the succeeding Court of Assize, which twenty four Men or any sixteen of them, shall be a Grand Jury and shall enquire of and present all Treasons, Murders, Felonies or other Misdemeanors whatever which shall have been committed or done in any of  the Counties within the Jurisdiction of such assize Courts respectively. And, upon any Indictment for a Capital offence being found by a Grand Jury to be true against any person or persons, the Judges shall cause such person or persons to be immediately arraigned and tried by a Petit Jury, summoned as herein before directed and he or they being found Guilty, pass such Judgment, as the Laws direct, and thereupon award Execution; and, if the Prisoner shall be found not Guilty, to acquit him or her of the Charge.  
Provided that in all Trials the Defendant shall, on petition be allowed Counsel, and that when sentence of Death shall be passed upon any Prisoner, there shall be one Calender Month at least between the Judgment and Execution.  
The Judges of the General Court may also on other Occasions upon good C

fail to appear and give ſpecial bail, if ruled thereto, in ſuch caſe the ſherift may  
have like liberty of defence, and ſhall be ſubje&amp; to the ſame recovery as is pro-  
vided in the cafe of appearance-bail, And if the ſheriff depart this life before  
judgment be confirmed againſt him, in ſuch caſe the judgment may be confirmed  
againſt his executors or adminiſtrators; or if there ſhall not be a certificate of  
probate or adminiftration granted, then it may be confirmed againſt his eſtate, and  
a writ of fiert facias may in either caſe be iſlued ; but the plaintiff ſhall object to  
the ſufficiency of the bail during the ſitting of the court next ſueceding that to  
which the writ is returnable, or in the office on the firſt or ſecond rule-day, and  
at no time thereafter. And all queſtions concerning the fufficiency of bail ſo ob-  
  
  
ſucceeding court; and in all caſes where the bail ſhall be judged inſufficient,  
and judgment entered againſt the ſheriff, he ſhall have the ſame remedy againſt  
the eſtate of the bail as againſt the eſtate of the defendant: Alſo, that every  
judgment entcred in the ollice againſt a defendant and bail, or againſt a defend-  
ant and ſheriff, ſhall be ſet aſide, if the defendant, upon the third day of the ſue-  
ceeding court, ſhall be allowed to appear without bail, put in good bail, being  
ruled ſo to do, or ſurrender himſelf in cuſtody, and ſhall plead to iſſue imme-  
diately; on which third day the court ſhall regulate all other proceedings in the  
  
  
may have happened therein. In every caſe where judgment ſhall be confirmed  
againſt any defendant or defendants and bail, or the ſheriff, his executors, &#x27; ad-  
miniſtrators, or eſtate, as aforeſaid, the court, upon motion of ſuch bail, or of  
ſuch ſheriff, his executors or adminiſtrators, or any other perſon on behalf of  
his eſtate, may order an attachment againſt the eſtate of ſuch defendant or de-  
fendants, returnable to the next ſucceeding court; and upon the execution and  
return of ſuch attachment, the court ſhall order the eſtate ſeized, or ſo much  
thereof as will be ſufficient to ſatisfy the judgment and coſts, and all coſts ac-  
cruing under the attachment, to be fold as goods taken in execution upon a filers  
faciagz and out of the money ſuch judgment and all cofts ſhall be ſatisfied, and  
the ſurplus, if any, reſtored to the defendant ot defendants when required.  
  
SECT. XI. ANY judge of the ſaid court, when the court is not fitting, or any  
juſtice of the peace, may take recognizance of ſpecial bail in any action thereinl  
depehding, which ſhall be taken, and ſhall be tranſmitted by the perſon taking  
the ſame before the next ſucceeding court, to the clerk of the ſaid court, to be  
filed with the papers in ſuch action; and if the plaintiff or his attorney ſhall ex-  
cept to the ſufficiency of bail ſo taken, notice of ſuch exception ſhall be given  
to the defendant or his attorney, at leaſt ten days previous to the day on which  
ſuch exception ſhall be taken : And if ſuch bail ſhall be judged inſufficient by  
  
the court, the recognizance thereof ſhall be diſcharged, and ſuch proceedings ſhall  
be had as if no ſuch bail had been taken, | |  
  
SECT. XII. EVERY ſpecial bail may ſurrender the principal before the court  
  
  
judgment ſhall be given, and thereupon the bail ſhall be diſcharged, and the  
defendant or defendants ſhall be committed to the cuſtody of the ſheriff or jail-  
or attending ſuch court, if the plaintiff or his attorney ſhall deſire the ſame 3  
or ſuch ſpecial bail may diſcharge himſelf or herſelf, by ſurrendering the prinei-  
pal or principals to the ſheriff of the county where the original writ was ſerved,  
and ſuch ſheriff ſhall receive ſuch defendant or defendants; and commit him, her,  
or them to the jail of his county, and ſhall give a receipt for the body or bodies  
of ſuch defendant or defendants, which ſhall be by the bail forthwith tranſmitted  
to the clerk of the county where the ſuit is or was depending. When ſuch ren-  
dei after judgment ſhall be to the ſheriff, he ſhall keep ſuch defendant or defend-  
ants in his cuſtody in the ſame manner, and ſubject to the like rules, as are pro-  
vided for debtors committed in execution during the ſpace of twenty days, unleſs  
the creditor, his attorney or agent, ſhall ſooner conſent to his, her, or their dif-  
  
  
attorney or agent; and if within the ſaid twenty days ſuch creditor,  
or agent, ſhall not in writing charge the debtor or debtors  
or they ſhall be forthwith diſcharged out of cuſtody ;  
  
SecT. XII. WHEN the ſheriff or other proper officer ſhall return on any ori-  
  
  
the defendant make his defence in like manner as if his appearance-bail had heen  
entered and accepted; but ſuch defendant ſhall not be diſcharged out of cuſtod  
  
until he ſhall put in good bail, or the plaintiff ſhall be ruled by the court to accept  
an appearance without bail; and where any defendant, after appearance entered,

plead, and deliver copies of ſuch declaration and rule to the defendant 4 or hiv

against the other is not erroneous. 1. Wash. 9, Brown  
t. Belches.  
  
The omission of the clerk, at the rules, to enter the  
suit abated as to Fisher, is not error.  
  
By the statute of Virginia respecting the District  
Courts of that state it is enacted that where the  
sheriff or other officer, shall return on any writ of  
capias to answer in any civil action, that the Defendant  
is not found within his bailiwick, the Plaintiff may  
either sue out an alias or a plurias capias, until the De-  
fendant shall be arrested, or a testatwm capias where he  
shall be removed into another county; or may at his  
election sue out an attachment against the estate of the  
Defendant to force an appearance.” Rev. Code, p. 86,  
§ 33. And « on the retarn of the pluries, that the De-  
fendant is not found, the Court, instead of the process  
of outlawry formerly used, may order a proclamation  
to issue, warning the Defendant to appear at a certain  
  
day therein named, or that judgment will be rendered  
  
against him, which proclamation shall be published,”  
&amp;c.—« and if the Defendant fails to appear pursuant  
to such proclamation, the same proceedings shall be  
had, and the same judgment given, as in other cases of  
default.” Rev. Cove, p. 87, § 44.
