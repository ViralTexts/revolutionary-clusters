[New York, 20 July 1776]  
  
After usual Compliments in which as well as through the whole Conversation Col. P. addressed Gen. Washington by the Title of Excelly: Col: Patterson entered upon the Business by saying That Gen. Howe much regretted the Difficulties which had arisen respecting the Address of the Letters to Genl W.—that it was deemed consistent with Propriety &amp; founded upon  
  
Precedents of the like Nature by Embassadors &amp; Plenipotentiaries where Disputes or Difficulties of Rank had arisen—That Gen. W. might recollect he had last Summer address’d a Letter to Gen. Howe to the Hon: William Howe Esqe—That Ld Howe &amp; General H. did not mean to derogate from the Respect or Rank of Genl W.—that they held his Person &amp; Character in the highest Esteem—That the Direction with the Addition of &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—implied every thing that ought to follow. He then produced a Letter which he did not directly offer to Gen. W. but observed that it was the same Letter which had been sent &amp; laid it on the Table with a Superscription to Geo. Washington &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—The General declined the Letter &amp; said that a Letter directed to a person in a publick Character should have some Description or Indication of it otherwise it would appear a mere private Letter—That it was true the &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. implied every thing &amp; they also implied any thing. That the Letter to Gen. Howe alluded to was an Answer to one received under a like Address from him—which the Officer on Duty having taken he did not think proper to return, but answered it in the same Mode of Address. That he should absolutely decline any Letter directed to him as a private Person when it related to his publick Station. Col. P. then said that Genl Howe would not urge his Delicacy farther &amp; repeated his Assertions that no Failure of Respect was intended. He then said that he would endeavour as well as he could, to recollect Gen. Howes Sentiments on the Letter &amp; Resolves of Congress sent him a few Days before respecting the Treatment of our Prisoners in Canada—“That the Affairs of Canada were in another Department not subject to the Controul of Genl Howe—but that he &amp; Ld Howe utterly disapproved of every Infringement of the Rights of Humanity.[“] Col. P. then took a Paper out of his Pocket &amp; after looking it over said he had expressd nearly the words—Gen. W. then said that he had also forwarded a Copy of the Resolves to Gen. Burgoyne. To which Col. P. replied he did not doubt a proper Attention would be paid to them, &amp; that he (Gen. W.) was sensible that Cruelty was not the Characteristick of the British Nation.  
Col. P. then proceeded to say he had it in Charge to mention the Case of Genl Prescott who they were informd was treated with such Rigour that under his Age &amp; Infirmities fatal Consequences  
  
might be apprehended. Gen. Washington replied that Genl Prescotts Treatment had not fallen under his Notice—That all Prisoners under his particular Direction he had treated with Kindness &amp; made their Situation as easy &amp; comfortable as possible. That he did not know where General Prescott was, but believed his Treatment very different from their Information. Gen. W. then mentioned the Case of Col. Allen &amp; the Officers who had been confined in Boston Gaol—As to the first Col. P. answered that Gen. Howe had no Knowledge of it but by Information from Gen. Washington &amp; that the Canada Department was not under his Direction or Controul. That as to the other Prisoners at Boston whenever the State of the Army at Boston admitted it they were treated with Humanity &amp; even Indulgence—that he asserted this upon his Honour &amp; should be happy in an Opp[ortunit]y to prove it.  
Gen: W. then observed that the Conduct of several of the Officers would well have warranted a different Treatment from what they had received—some having refused to give any Parole, &amp; others having broke it when given by escaping or endeavouring so to do. Col. P. answered that as to the first they misunderstood the Matter very much &amp; seemed to have mistook the Line of Propriety exceedinly—and as to the latter Gen. Howe utterly disapproved &amp; condemned their Conduct—that if a Remonstrance was made such Violations of good Faith would be severely punished—but that he hoped Gen. W. was too just to draw publick Inferences from the Misbehaviour of some private Individuals that bad Men were to be found in every class &amp; Society—that such Behaviour was considered as a dishonour to the British Army.  
Col. Patterson then proceeded to say that the Goodness and Benevolence of the King had induced him to appoint Ld Howe &amp; Gen. H. his Commissioners to accomodate this unhappy Dispute—that they had great Powers &amp; would derive the greatest Pleasure from effecting an Accomodation—&amp; that he (Col. P.) wish’d to have this Visit considered as making the first Advances to this desirable Object. Gen. W. replied he was not vested with any Powers on this Subject by those from whom he derived his Authority &amp; Power. But from what had appeared or transpired on this Head Ld Howe &amp; Gen. Howe were only to grant Pardons—that those who had committed no Fault wanted no Pardon:  
  
that we were only defending what we deemed our indisputable Rights—Col. P. said that that would open a very wide Field for Argument. He then expressed his Apprehensions that an Adherence to Forms was likely to obstruct Business of the greatest Moment &amp; Concern. He then observed that a Proposal had been formerly made of exchanging Govr Skene for Mr Lovel, that he now had Authority to accede to that Proposal. Gen. W. replied that the Proposition had been made by the Direction of Congress, and having been then rejected he could not now renew the Business or give any Answer till he had previously communicated it to them.  
Col: Patterson behaved with the greatest Politeness &amp; Attention during the whole Business—express’d strong Acknowledgments that the usual Ceremony of blinding his Eyes had been dispensed with—At the breaking up of the Conference General Washington strongly invited him to partake of a small Collation provided for him—which he politely declined, alledging his late Breakfast—&amp; an Impatience to return to Gen. Howe tho he had not executed his Commission so amply as he wish’d—Finding he did not propose staying he was introduced to the General Officers, after which he took his Leave &amp; was safely conducted to his own Boat which waited for him about 4 Miles distant from the City

Hon. William Howe, Efq; that Lord  
Howe and Gen. Howe, did not mean to

Wathington ; that they held his perfon  
and chara¢ter in the higheft efteem; that  
the direction, with the addition of &amp;c.  
implied every thing that ought to follow.  
He then produced a letter which he did  
not directly offer to Gen. Wathington,  
but obierved that it was the fame letter  
  
  
  
343  
which had been fent, and laid it on the  
table, with a fuperfeription to George  
Wathington, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The General  
declined the letter, and faid, that a let-  
ter direéted te 2 perfon in a public cha»  
  
racter, fhou&#x27;d have fome defeviption or  
indication it, otherwife it would ap«  
pear a mere private letter; that it was  
true the &amp;e. &amp;c. &amp;c. implied every thing  
  
and they alfo implied any thing ; that  
the jetter to Gen Howe alluded to, was  
an anfwer to one received under a like  
addrefs from him, which the officer on  
daty having taken, he did not think  
proper to return, but anfwered it in the  
fame mode of addrefs; that he fhould  
abfolutely decline any letter direéted to  
him as a private perfon, when it related  
to his public flation, Col. Patterfon  
then faid, that Gen. Howe would not  
urge lis delicacy farther, and repeated  
his affertions, that no failure of refpeé&amp;  
was intended. He then faid that he  
would endeavour, as wellas he could,  
to recolleé&amp;t Gen. Howe’s fentiments on  
the letter and refolves of Congrefs, fent  
him a few days before, refpecting the  
treatment of onr prifoners in Canada.  
‘* That the affairs of Canada were in an-  
other departmesit, not fubjeét to the  
controu! of Gen. Howe, but that he and  
Lord Howe utterly difapproved of every,  
infringement of the rights of humanity.’*  
Col. Patterfon then took a paper vut of  
his pocket; and, after looking it over,  
faid he had exprefled nearly the words.  
Gen. Wafhington then faid that he had  
alfo forwarded a copy of the Refolves to  
Gen. Burgoyne. To which Col, Pat-  
terfon replied he did not doubt a proper  
attention would be paid to them, and  
that he (Gen. Wafhington) was fenfible  
that cruelty was not the charatteriftic of  
the Britith nation. Col. Patterfon then  
proceeded to fay he had it in charge to  
mention the caie of Gen. Prefcot, who  
they were informed was treated with fuch  
rigour, that, under his age and infirmi-  
tics, fatal confequences might be appre-  
hendeds ’  
  
Gen. Wahhirgton replied that Gen.  
Preteot’s treatment had not fallen under  
his notice; that all perfons under his  
particular diregtion, he had treated with  
kindnefs, and made their fituation as ea-  
fy and comfortable as pofflible; that he  
did not know where Gen, Prefcot was,  
but believed his treatment very different  
from theic information. Gen. Wafhing-  
  
ton then mentioned the cafe of Col. Al-  
len, and the officers who had been con-  
fined in Bofton jail. As tothe firft, Col.  
Patterfon anfwered that Gen. Howe had  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
344  
no knowledge of it but by information  
from Gen. Washington, and that the  
Canada department was not under his  
direction or controul; that as to the o-  
ther prifoners at Bofton, when ever the  
ftate of the army at Bofton admitted it,  
they were treated with humanity and e-  
ven indulgence ; that he affeited this up-  
on his honor, and fhould be happy in an  
opportunity to prove it.  
  
Gen. Waihington then obferved, that  
the conduct of feveral of the officers would  
well have warranted a different treatment  
. from what they had received ; fome hav-  
ing refufed to give any parole, and others  
having broke it when given, by efcaping  
or endeavouring fo to do. Col. Patter-  
fon aniwered, that as to the firft, they  
mifunderftood the matter very much,  
and feemed to have miftook the line of  
propriety exceedingly ; and as to the lat-  
ter, Gen. Howe utterly dijapprovéd and  
condemned their conduct.  
  
That if a remonftrance was made, fuch  
violations of good faith would be feverely  
punithed; but that he hoped General  
Wathington was too juft to draw public  
inferences from the mifbehaviour of fome  
private individuals ; that bad men were  
to be found in every cflafs and fociety ;  
that fuch behaviour was confidered as a  
difhonour to the Britifh army. Colonel  
Patterfon then proceeded to fay, that  
the goodnefs and benevolence of the  
King had induced him to appoint Lord  
Howe and Gen. Howe his Commiffion-  
ers, to accommodate this unhappy dif-  
pute, that they had great powers, and  
would derive the greate(t pleafure from  
effecting an accommodation; and that  
he (Col. Patterfon) wifhed to have this  
vifit confidered as making the firft ad-  
vances to this deficable objeét. General  
Webhington replied, he was not vefted  
with any powers on this fubje&amp;, by thofe  
from whom he derived his authority and  
power, But from what had appeared or  
tran{pired on this head, Lord Howe and  
Gen. Howe were only to grant pardons;  
that thofe who had committed no fault  
wanted no pardon, that we were only  
defending what we deemed our indifput-  
able right. Col. Patterfon {aid that he  
would open a very,wide field for argu-  
ment. He then exprefled his apprehen-  
fions that an adherence to forms was  
likely to ob{truét bufineis of the greatest  
moment and concern.  
  
He then obferved that a propofal had  
been formerly made of exchanging Gov.  
Skene for Mr. Lovell; that he now had  
authority to accede to that propofal.  
Gen, Wathington replied, that the pro-  
pofition had been made by the direétion

of Congrefs, and having been then rejec-  
ted, he could not now renew the bufi-  
nefs, or give any anfwer, till he had pre-  
vicuily communicated it to them.  
  
Col. Patterfon behaved with the great.

an impatience to return to Gen. Howe,

der General Howe, July 20, 1776.  
After usual compliments, in which, as  
through the whole conversation, Col. Pat­  
terson addressed General Wathington by the  
title of Excellency, Col. Patterson entered  
upon the business by {aying, that Géeneral  
Howe much regretted the difficulties which  
had arisen refpe&amp;ing the address of the let­  
ters to General Wathington ; thatit wasdee­  
med confittent with propriety, &amp; tound=d on  
precedents of the like nature by Ambafladors  
and Plenipatentiaries where disputes or d Hi­  
culties of rank had arisen ; that Generz!  
Wathington might recollect he had,laft ftum­  
mer, addrefled a letter to Gen. Howe, To  
the Hon. Wm. Howe, Eiq ; that Lord Howe  
and Gen. Howe did not mean to derogate  
from the refpeét or rank of General Wath­  
ington ; that they held his person and cha­  
rallerin the highest esteem ; that the directi­  
on, with the addition of &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. implied  
every thing that cught to follow. He then  
produced a letter which he did not directly  
offer to General Wathington, but obterved  
that it was the fame letter which had been  
sent, and laid it on the table, with a fuper­  
{cription to George Wzthington,&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.  
The General declined the letter, and laid  
that a letter directed to a person in a public  
charaéter, fliould have some description or  
indicaion of it, otherwise it would appear a  
mere private letter ; that it was true the &amp;c.  
&amp;c. &amp;c. implied every thing, and they also  
implied any thing ; that the letter to Gen.  
Howe alluded to, was in answer to one re­  
ceived under a like address from him, which  
the officer on duty having taken, he did not  
think proper to return, but anfwerd itin the  
fame mode of address ; that he should abso­  
lutely decline any letter directed to him as a  
private person, when it related to his public  
station Col. Patterson then said, that Ge­  
neral Howe would not urge his delicacy any  
further, and repeated his assertions, that no  
failure of refpe@ was intended. He then  
said, that he would endeavour as well as he  
could, to recollet General Howe’s sentiments  
on the letter and resolve of Congress, sent  
him a few days before, refpetting the treat­  
ment of our priforers in Canada. “That  
the affairs of Canada were in 2another depart­  
ment not subject to the controul of Gene­  
ral Howe, but that he and Lord Howe ut­  
terly disapproved of every infringement on  
the righ&#x27;s ot humanity.” Cal. Patierfon then  
took a paper out of his pocket ; and after  
looking it over, said he had expreficd nearly  
the words. General Wathington said that  
he had alio forwarded a copy of the resolves  
  
SATURDAY, August 17, 1776.  
  
to General Burgoyne. To which Col, Pat­  
terson replied, he did not doubt a proper at­  
tention would be paid to them, and that he  
(Gen. Wathington)was sensible that cruelty  
was not the charalteriftic of the Britith na­  
tion. Col, Patterson then froceeded to fay,  
he had it in charge to mention the case of  
Gen. Prefcot, who they were informed was  
treated with such rigour, that under his age  
~and infirmities, fatal conifequences might be  
apprehended. &#x27;  
General Wathington replied, that General  
Preicot’s treatment had not fallen under his  
notice ; that all persons under his particular  
direétion, be had treated with Kindness, and  
made their situation as ealy and comtortable  
as poflible ; that he did not know where Gen­  
eral Prefcot was, but believed his treatment  
was very diff:rent from their information,  
General Wathington then mentioned the  
case of Col. Allen, and the othicers who had  
beent confined in Boston goal. &#x27;‘As to the  
figit, Col. Patterson answered, that General  
H»owe, had no knowledge ot it but by infor­  
mation from General Washington, and that  
the Canada deparrment was not under his  
dire&amp;tion or controul ; that as to the other  
pritoners at B .fton, when ever the state of  
the army at Boftun admitred it, they were  
treated with humanity and even induigence ;  
that this he asserted upon his honour, and  
thould be happy inan opp-rtunity to prove it.  
General Waihington then oblerved, that  
the conduét of several of the officers would  
well have warranted a different treatment  
from what they had received ; some having  
refuted to give any parole, and aothers having  
broke it when given, by escaping, or endea­  
vouring so to do. Col. Patterson answered,  
that as to the firft, they mifunderfiocd the  
matter very much, and seemed to have mif­  
tock the line of propriety exceedingly ; and  
asto the latter, General Howe utterly disap­  
proved and condemned their conduct.  
_That if a 2 remonfirance was made, such  
violations of good faith, would be severely  
punished ; but that he hoped General Wath­  
ington was too just tudraw public inferences  
from the mifbehaviour of some private indi­  
viduals ; that bad men were to be found in  
every class and society ; that such bebaviour  
was considered as a dithonour to the Britith  
army. Col, Paterson then proceeded to {ay,  
that the goodness and benevolence of the  
King had induced him to appoint Lord and  
Gen. Howe his Commissioners, to accommo­  
date this unhappy difpute,that they bhad great  
powers, &amp; would derive the greatest pleasure  
from effeéting an accommodation ; &amp; that he  
(Col. Patterson) wished to have this visit con­  
sidered as making the firit advances to this  
desirable object. General Wafhinton repli­  
ed that, he was not vefled with any powers  
on this fubjeét, by thote from whom he de­  
rived his authority and power. But from  
what had appeared or tranipired on this head  
Lord Howe and General Howe were only  
to grant pardons ; thar those who had com­  
mitted no fault wanted no pardon, that we  
were only defending what we deemed cur in­  
disputable right, Col, Patterion said that  
  
would open avery wide field for argument,  
He then exprefled his apprehension that an  
adherance to forms was likely to obftru¢t bu­  
siness ot the greateit moment and concern.  
He then cbferved that a proposal had been  
formerly made of exchavrging Gov. Skene  
for Mr. Lovell; that he now had authori­  
ty to accede to that proposal, General Wafh­  
ingron replied, that the propofirion had been  
made by the dire¢tion ot Congress, and ha­  
ving been then rejected, he could not now re­  
new the business, or give any answer, till he  
had previously communicated it to them.  
Col. Patterson behaved with the greatest  
attention and politeness during the whole  
business, exprefling strong acknowledgments  
that the usual ceremony of blinding his eyes  
had been dispensed with. At the breaking  
up of the conferrence, General Wathington  
{trongly invited him to partake of a small  
collation provided for hitu, which he politely  
declined, aliedging his late breakfaft, and  
an impatience to return to General Howe,  
thought he had not executed his commiflion  
so amply as he withed. Finding he did not  
propote staying, he was introduced to the  
General Officers, after which he took his  
leave, aed was fafely condulted to his own

his public ftation. Col. Paterfon then  
faid, that Gen. Howe would not urge  
his delicacy any farther, and repeated  
his affertions, that no failure of refpe&amp;  
was intended. He then faid that he  
would endeavour, as well as he could,  
to recollect Gen. Howe’s (entiments on  
the letter and refolves of Congrefs,  
fent him a few days before, refpeéting  
the treaiment of our prifoners in Ca-  
nada.  
  
That the affairs of Canada were in  
another department, not fubjeét to the  
controul of General Howe, but that he  
and Geneial Howe uiterly difapproved  
of every intringement of the rights of  
humaniy.—Colonel Paterfon then took  
a paver out of his pocket; and, after  
looking it over, faid he had expreffed  
nearly the fame words. Gen. Wath-  
ington then faid, that he had alfo fore  
warded a copy of the refolves to Gen.  
Burgoyne. To which Col. Paterion  
replied, he did not doubt but a proper  
attention would be paid to them, and  
that he (Gen. Wafhington) was fen-  
fible that cruelty was not the charac-  
teriftic of the Britith nation. Colonel  
Paterfon then proceeded to fay he  
had it in charge to mention the cafe of  
Gen. Prefcot, who they were informed  
was treated with fuch rigour, that,  
under his age and infirmities, fatal  
confequences might be apprehended.

Arguments on a Claim of the Lord-Mayor’s Privilege.  
  
Prefecot’s treatment had not fallen un-  
der his notice; that all perfons under  
his particular direétion, he had treated  
with kindnefs, and made their fituation  
as eafy and comfortable as poffible ;  
that he did not know where Gen. Pref-  
cot was, but believed his treatment was  
different from their information. Gen.  
Wathington then mentioned the cafe  
of Col. Allen, and the cfhicers who  
had been confined in Botton jail. As  
to the firft, Col. Pate:fon anfwered,  
that Gen. Howe had no knowledge of  
it, but by information from General  
Wahhington, and that the Canada com-  
pany was not under his direétion or  
controul ; but as to the other prifon-  
ers at Bolton, whenever the ftate of the  
army at Bofton admitted it, they were  
treated with humanity and even indul-  
gence; that he afferted this upon his  
honour, and fhould be happy in an  
opportunity to prove it.  
  
General Wathington then obferved,  
that the conduct of feveral of the offi-  
cers would well have warranted a dif-  
ferent treatment from what they had  
received ; fome having refufed to give  
any parole, and others having broke it  
when given, by elcaping or endeavour-  
ing foto do. Col. Patcrfon anfwered,  
that, as to the firft, they mifunderftood  
the matter very much, and feemed to  
have miftook the line of propriety ex-  
ceedingly ; and as to the latter, Gen,  
Howe utterly difaoproved, and con-  
demned their conduct.  
  
That, if a remonitrance was made,  
fuch violations of good faith would be  
feverely punifhed ; but that he hoped  
General Wafhington was too juft to  
draw public inferences from the m:fbe-  
haviour of fome private individuals ;  
that bad men were to be found in every  
clafs and fociety ; and fuch behaviour  
was confidered as a difhonour to the  
Britih army. Col. Paterfon then pro-  
ceeded to fay, that the goodnefs and  
benevolence of the King bad induced  
him to appoint Lord Howe ard Gene-  
rai Howe his commiffioners, to accom-  
modaie this unhappy difpute; that they  
had great powers, and would derive  
the greateft pleafure from effe@ing an  
accommodation ; and that he (Col. Pa-  
terfon) withed to have this vifit confi-  
dered as making the firft advances to  
this defirable obje&amp;t. Gen. Wathing-  
ton replied, he was not velted with any  
power on this fubjeét, by thofe from  
whom he dirived his authority and  
power, But from what had appeared  
or tranfpired on this head, Lord Howe  
  
551  
and General Howe were only to grant  
pardons; that thofe who had commit-  
ted no fault wanted no pardon; that  
we were only defending what we deem.  
ed our indifputable right. Col. Pater-  
fon faid that would open a very wide  
field for argument. He then exprefled  
his apprehenficns, that an adherence to  
forms, was likely to obftrué bufinefs  
of the greateft moment and concern.  
  
He then obferved, that a propofal  
had been formerly made of exchanging  
Governor Skene for Mr. Lovell ; thae  
he now had authority to accede to that  
propofal, Gen. Wathington replied,  
that the propofi:ion had been made by  
the diregtion of Congrefs, and having  
been then rejeéted, he could not now  
reoew the bufinefs, or give any anfwer,  
till he had previoufly communicated it  
to them,  
  
Colonel Paterfon behaved with the  
greateft attention and politenefs during  
the whole bufinefs, expreffed ftrong ac-  
knowledgments that the ufual ceremo-  
ny of blinding his eyes had been dif-  
penfed with. At the breaking up of  
the conference, General Wathington  
ftrongly invited him to partake of a  
fmall collation provided for him, which  
he politely declined, alledging his late  
breakfaft, and an impatience to return  
to Gen. Howe, though he had not ex-  
ecuted his commiffion fo amply as he  
wifhed, Finding he did not propofe  
ftaying, he was introduced to the Ge-  
neral Officers, after which he took his  
leave, and was fafely conducted to his  
own boat, which waited for him, about  
four miles diftant from the city

department, not fubject to the controul of gene-  
rl Howe, bute that he and general Howe utterly  
dilapprov: d of every infringement’ of the rights  
of humanity. — Colonel Paterfon then took a  
out of his pocket; and, after looking  
  
es faid he had exprefled nearly the  
fame words. General Wafhington then faid,  
  
that he had alfo forwarded a copy of the refolves  
to general Burgoyne. To which colonel Pater-  
fon replied, he did not doubt but a proper at-  
tention would be paid to them, and that he  
(general Wafhington) was fenfible that cruelty  
was pot the characterrttic of the Britith nation,  
Colonel Paterfon then proceeded to lay he had  
tt in charge to mention the cafe of general  
Prefcot, who they were informed was treated  
with {uch rigour, that, under his age and infirmi-  
ties, fatal confequences might be apprehended.  
General Wafhington replied, that general  
Prefcot’s treatment had not fallen under his no-  
tice; that all perfons under his particular direc-  
tion, he had treated with kindnefs, and made  
their fituation as eafy and comfortable as pofli-  
ble: that he did not know where general Pref-  
cot was, but believed his treatment was differ-  
entfrom their information. Gen, Wafhington  
then mentioned the cafe of colonel Allen, and  
  
the oficers who had been confined in Bofton  
  
jail, As to the firft, colonel Paterfon anfwered,  
that general Howe had no knowledge ot it, bus  
by information from general Wafhington, and  
that the Canada company was not under his  
direStion or controul; but as to the other pri-  
foners at Bofton, whenever the ftate of the  
army at Bofton admitted it, they were treated  
with humanity and even indulgence; that he  
afferted this upon his honour, and fhould be  
happy in an opportunity to prove it.  
  
General Wafhington then obferved, that the  
tonduct of feveral of the officers would well have  
warranted a different treatment from what they  
had received; fome having refuled to give any  
parole, and others having broke it “when given,  
by elcaping or endeavouring fo to do. Col. Pa-  
terion anfwered, that, as to the firft, they mil-  
underftood the matter very much, and feemed to  
have miftook the line of p:opriety exceedingly ,  
wd as to the latter, Gen Howe utterly diiap-  
proved, and condemned their conduct,  
  
That, if a remonftrance was made, fuch vio-  
lations of good faith would be feverely punithed ,  
but that he hoped general Wafhington was too  
jult to diaw public inferences from the mifbe-  
haviour of fome private individuals, that bad  
  
| Men were to be found in every clafs and fociety ;  
| @adlach behaviour was confjdercd as a difho-

nour to the Britifh army. Col, Paterfon then  
proceeded to fay, that the goodnefs and bene~  
volence of the king had induced him to appoing  
lord Howe and general Howe his commiffioners  
to accommodate this unhappy difpute; that the .  
had great powers, and would derive the realtek  
Plealure from effecting an accommodation; and  
that he (colonel Paterfon) withed to have  
this vifit confidered as making the firft advances  
to this defirable object. General Wathington  
replied, he was not invefted with any power on  
this fubject, by thofe from whom ‘he derived  
his authority and power. . But from what had  
appeared or trantpired on this head, lord Howe  
and general Howe were only to grant ardons  
that thofe who had committed no fault wanted  
no pardon, that we were only defending whag  
we deemed our indifputable right. Colonel Pas  
terfon taid that would open a very wide field fos  
argument. He then expreffed his apprehenfions,  
that an adherence to forms, was likely to ob»  
{truct bufinels of the greateft moment and con«  
cern.  
  
He then obferved, that a propofal had been  
formerly made of exchanging governor Skene  
for Mr. Lovell; that he now had authority to  
accede to that propofal. Gen, Wathington’ re.  
plied, that the propofition had been made by the  
diretion of congrefs, and having been then re.  
jected, he could not now renew the bufinets, or  
give any aniwer, till he had previoufly commuyu-  
nicated it to them.  
  
Colonel Paterfon behaved with the greateft  
attention and politenefs during the whole bufinefe  
expreffed ftrong acknowledgments that the  
ufual ceremony of blinding his eyes had been  
diipented with. At the breaking up of the con+  
ference, gencral Wathington ftrongly invited hima  
to partake of a {mall collation provided for him,  
which he politely declined, alledging his late  
breakfalt, and an impatience to return to gen,  
Howe, though he had not executed his commif-  
fion fo amply as he wifhed. Finding he did  
not propofe ftaying, he was introduced te the  
general ofhcers, after which he took his leave,  
and was fafely conducted to his own boat, which  
waited for him, about four miles diftant from

description or indication of it otherwise U  
would appear a mere private letter ; that it  
war true the &amp;c Ac. Ax. implied every

that tba letter to, General Howe alluded to,

To which Colonel Patterson replied he did  
not doubt a proper attention would be paid

Was sensible that cruelty was not the char­

ness, and msde their situation as easy and

prisoners at Boston, whenever the, state of
