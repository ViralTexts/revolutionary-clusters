But so far as abuses of power are engendered by a division of a Community into the agricultural &amp;  
manufacturing interests and by the necessary ascendancy of  one or the other, as it may comprize the majority, the  
question to be decided is whether the danger of oppression from this source must not soon arise within the several States  
themselves; and render a majority Govt. as unavoidable an evil in the States individually as it is represented to be in  
the States collectively;  
That Virginia must soon become manufacturing as well as agricultural, and be divided into those two great  
interests is obvious &amp; certain. Manufactures grow out of the labour not needed for agriculture, and labour will  
cease to be so needed or employed, as its products satisfy &amp; saturate the demands for Domestic use &amp; for  
foreign markets. Whatever be the abundance or  fertility of the soil, it will not be cultivated when its fruits must  
perish on hand for want of a demand for a market. And is it not manifest that this must be henceforward more &amp;  
more the case; &amp; in this State particularly. The Earth produces at this time, as much as is called for by the home  
&amp; the foreign markets: whilst the labouring population, notwithstanding the emigrations to the West &amp; the  
S. West is fast increasing. Nor can we shut our eyes to the fact, that the rapid increase of the exports of flour  
&amp; Tobo. from a new &amp; more fertile soil, will be continually lessening the demand on Virginia for her two  
great staples; and be forcing her, by the inability to pay for imports by exports, to provide within herself substitutes  
for the former.  
Under every aspect of the subject it is clear that Virga. must be speedily a manufacturing as well as an  
agricultural State; that the people will be formed into the same great classes here as elsewhere, that the case  
of the tariff must of cou
