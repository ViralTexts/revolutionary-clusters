looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord  
looketh on the heart”? And was not the cry of  
David to God, “ Behold thou desirest truth in the  
inward parts”? “Love your enemies, bless them  
that curse you, do good to them that hate you,” said  
Jesus. “If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass  
going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him  
again,” said Moses. “If thou see the ass of him that  
hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest for-  
bear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.”  
And Solomon had added: “If thine enemy be hun-  
gry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty,  
give him water to drink: for thou shalt heap coals of  
fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee.”  
And so all through the Sermon on the Mount.

partly in the wrong. The commandment  
of God on which all the reasoning of ex­  
treme peace men is based is; “Thou shalt  
do no murder.” It was certainly never  
intended by the great Law Giver that  
&#x27;human life should never be taken; for  
in thousands of instances the same Giver  
of Law sanctioned and directed the tak­  
ing of human life. And I believe it is a  
mistake to assert that the principles of  
law were changed by our Lord. He ex­  
pressly states that he came not to de­  
stroy the law or the prophets, but to  
fulfill. The everlasting principle was  
always the same as given by Moses,  
when he says; “Thou shalt not avenge  
nor bear any grudge against the chil­

## [THE SIN OF USURY.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/87302156)

n whose words I commenced my  
sermon by quoting, tho rector of St.  
Mary Woolnoth, &#x27;Lombard-street, a  
century or two ago, quite rightly  
interpreted his text from Ezekiel about  
the men who have given themselves over  
to usury. When he said — mark it — &#x27; He  
that taketh any increase above the  
principal, not six in a hundred, but let  
it be never so little, and never so  
moderate, he that taketh any interest is  
a usurer, and such as shall surely die  
for his usury.&#x27; The early Jewish law on  
the subject is quite explicit in its  
detailed exposition. You will remember  
what is said.in Exodus xxii., 25, 2C— &#x27;  
If thou lend money to any of My people  
that is poor by thee thou shalt not be  
to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou  
lay upon him usury. If thou at all take  
thy neighbor&#x27;s raiment to pledge, thou  
sbalt .deliver it unto him by that the  
sun goeth down.&#x27; In Leviticus xxv., 35,  
a similar clause runs thus— &#x27;.If thy  
brother be waxen poor and his hand  
failetli with thee, then ehalt thou hold  
him. . . . Take no usury of him or  
increase, but fear thy God that thy  
brother may live with thee.&#x27; One might  
quote many passages from the Psuhns and  
the Prophets where commsndation is  
pronounced ou those who take no usury,  
and malediction on those who do. On the  
other hand, it is true that i
