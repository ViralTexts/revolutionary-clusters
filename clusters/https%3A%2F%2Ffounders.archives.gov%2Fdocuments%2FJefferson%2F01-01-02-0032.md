The Association entered into last Friday, the 22d instant, by the Gentlemen of the House of Burgesses, and the Body of Merchants, assembled in this city.  
We his Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects of Virginia, declaring our inviolable and unshaken fidelity and attachment to our gracious sovereign, our affection for all our fellow subjects of Great Britain, and our firm determination to support, at the hazard of our lives and fortunes, the laws, the peace, and good order of government in this colony; but at the same time affected with great and just apprehensions of the fatal consequences certainly to follow from the arbitrary imposition of taxes on the people of America, for the purpose of raising a revenue from them, without the consent of their representatives; and as we consider it to be the indispensable duty of every virtuous member of society to prevent the ruin, and promote the happiness, of his country, by every lawful means, although in the prosecution of such a laudable and necessary design some unhappy consequences may be derived to many innocent fellow subjects, whom we wish not to injure, and who we hope will impute our conduct to the real necessity of our affairs: Influenced by these reasons, we do most earnestly recommend this our association to the serious attention of all Gentlemen merchants, traders, and other inhabitants of this colony, not doubting but they will readily and cordially accede thereto. And at the same time we, and every of us, do most solemnly oblige ourselves, upon our word and honour, to promote the welfare and commercial interests of all those truly worthy merchants, traders, and others, inhabitants of this colony, who shall hereafter conform to the spirit of this association; but that we will upon all occasions, and at all times hereafter, avoid purchasing any commodit[y o]r article of goods whatsoever from any importer or seller of British merchandise or European goods, whom we may know or believe, in violation of the essential interests of this colony, to have preferred their own private emolument, by importing or selling articles prohibited by this association, to the destruction of the dearest rights of the people of this colony. And for the more effectual discovery of such defaulters, it is resolved,  
That a committee of five be chosen in every county, by the majority of associators in each county, who, or any three of them, are hereby  authorized to publish the names of such signers of the association as shall violate their agreement; and when there shall be an importation of goods into any county, such committee, or any three of them, are empowered to convene themselves, and in a civil manner apply to the merchant or importers concerned and desire to see the invoices and papers respecting such importation, and if they find any goods therein contrary to the association to let the importers know that it is the opinion and request of the county that such goods shall not be opened or stored, but reshipped to the place from whence they came: And in case of refusal, without any manner of violence, inform them of the consequences, and proceed to publish an account of their conduct.  
Secondly. That we the subscribers, as well by our own example as all other legal ways and means in our power, will promote and encourage industry and frugality, and discourage all manner of luxury and extravagance.  
Thirdly. That we will not hereafter, directly or indirectly, import, or cause to be imported, from Great Britain, any of the goods hereafter enumerated, either for sale or for our own use; to wit, spirits, cider, perry, beer, ale, porter, malt, pease, beef, fish, butter, cheese, tallow, candles, fruit, pickles, confectionary, chairs, tables, looking glasses, carriages, joiners work, and cabinet work of all sorts, riband, India goods of all sorts (except spices) calico of more than 3s. sterling per yard, upholstery (by which is meant paper hangings, beds ready made, furniture for beds, and carpetting) watches, clocks, silversmiths work of all sorts, silks of all sorts (except womens bonnets and hats, sewing silk, and netting silk) cotton stuffs of more than 3s. sterling per yard, linens of more than 2s. sterling per yard (except Irish linens) gauze, lawns, cambrick of more than 6s. sterling per yard, woollen and worsted stuffs of all sorts of more than 2s. sterling per yard, broadcloths of more than 8s. sterling per yard, narrow cloths of all kinds of more than 4s. sterling per yard, not less than 7–8ths yard wide, hats of greater value than 10s. sterling, stockings of more than 36s. sterling per dozen, shoes of more than 5s. sterling per pair, boots, saddles, mens exceeding 25s. and womens exceeding 40s. sterling, exclusive of bridles, which are allowed, portmanteaus, saddle bags, and all other manufactured leather, neither oil or painters colours, if both, or either of them, be subject to any duty after the 1st of December next. And that we will not import, or cause to be imported, any horses, nor purchase those which may be imported by others after the 1st of November next.  
Fourthly. That we will not import or bring into the colony, or cause to be imported or brought into the colony, either by sea or land, any slaves, or make sale of any upon commission, or purchase any slave or slaves that may be imported by others after the 1st day of November next, unless the same have been twelve months upon the continent.  
Fifthly. That we will not import any wines, on which a duty is laid by act of Parliament for the purpose of raising a revenue in America, or purchase such as may be imported by others, after the 1st day of September next.  
Sixthly. That no wine be imported by any of the subscribers, or other  person, from any of the colonies on this continent, or any other place, from the time of signing this association, contrary to the terms thereof.  
Seventhly. That all such goods as may or shall be imported into this colony, in consequence of their having been rejected by the association committees in any of our sister colonies, shall not be purchased by any associator; but that we will exert every lawful means in our power absolutely to prevent the sale of all such goods, and to cause the same to be exported as quickly as possible.  
Eighthly. That we will not receive from Great Britain, or make sale of, upon commission, any of the articles above excepted to, after the first day of September next, nor any of those articles which may have been really and bona fide ordered by us, after the 25th of December next.  
Ninthly. That we will not receive into our custody, make sale of, or become chargeable with, any of the articles aforementioned, that may be ordered after the 15th of June instant, nor give orders for any from this time; and that in all orders which any of us may hereafter send to Great Britain we will expressly direct and request our correspondents not to ship us any of the articles before excepted, and if any such goods are shipped contrary to the tenour of this agreement we will refuse to take the same, or make ourselves chargeable therewith.  
Provided nevertheless, that such goods as are already on hand, or may be imported according to the true intent and meaning of this association, may be continued for sale.  
Tenthly. That a committee of merchants, to be named by their own body, when called together by their chairman, be appointed to take under their consideration the general state of the trade in this colony, and report to the association, at their next meeting, a list of such other manufactures of Great Britain, or commodities of any kind whatever, now imported, as may reasonably, and with benefit to the colony, be excepted to.  
Eleventhly. That we do hereby engage ourselves, by those most sacred ties of honour and love to our country, that we will not, either upon the goods which we have already upon hand or may hereafter import within the true meaning of this association, make any advance in price, with a view to profit by the restrictions hereby laid on the trade of this colony.  
Twelfthly. That we will not at any time hereafter, directly or indirectly, import, or cause to be imported, or purchase from any person who shall import, any merchandise or manufactures exported from Great Britain, which are, or hereafter shall be, taxed by act of Parliament for the purposes of raising a revenue in America.  
Resolved, that a meeting of the associators shall be called at the discretion of the Moderator, or at the request of twenty members of the association, signified to him in writing; and in case of the death of the present Moderator, the next person subscribing hereto be considered as Moderator, and act as such until the next general meeting.  
Lastly. That these resolves shall be binding on all and each of the subscribers, who do hereby, each and every person for himself, agree  that he will strictly and firmly adhere to and abide by every article of this association from the time of his signing the same until the act of Parliament which imposes a duty on tea, paper, glass, and painters colours, be totally repealed, or until a general meeting of one hundred associators, after one month’s publick notice, shall determine otherwise, the twelfth article of this agreement still and for ever continuing in force, until the contrary be declared by a general meeting of the members of this association.  
  
Signed in Williamsburg, this 22d of June, 1770.  
  
Peyton Randolph, Moderator.

The Association entered into last Friday, the 22d  
instaut, by the gentlemen of the House of Bur­  
gesses and the Body of Merchants aesembled  
in this city.  
We, his Majesty&#x27;s most dutiful and loyal subjects of Fir  
ginig, declaring our invioluble and unshaken fidelity and  
attachment to our gracious Sovereign, our affec ion for all  
our fellow-subjects of Great Britain, and our firm deter­  
mination to support, at the hazard of our lives and for­  
tunes, the laws, the peace, and good order of Government  
in this colony; but, at the same time, affected with great  
and just apprehensions of the fatal consequences certainly  
to follow from the arbitrary imposition of taxes on the peo­  
ple of Americe, for the purpose of raising a revenue from  
them, without the consent of their representatives; and,  
as we consider it to be the indispensable duty of every vir­  
tuous member of society to prevent the ruin and promote  
the happinces of his country by every lawful means, al­  
though in the prosecution of such a laudable and necessary  
design some unhappy conscquences may be derived to  
many innocent fellow-subjects, whom we wish nst to in­  
jure, and who we hope will impute our conduct to the real  
necessity of our affairs. Influenced by these reasons, we  
do most earnestly recommend this our association to the  
serious attention of all gentiemen, merchants, traders and,  
other inhabitants of this colony, not doubting but they will

merciel interests of all those truly worthy merchants, trad­

after conform to the spirit of this association; but that we  
will upon all occasions and at all times hereafter avoid pur.  
chasing any commodity or article of goods whatsoever from  
any importer or seller of British merchandise or Europeun  
goods, whom we may know or believe, in violation of the  
essential interests of this colony, to have preferred their  
own private emolument, by importing or selling articles  
prohibited by this association, to the destruction of the  
erris of mis colony. And for  
more effectual discovery of such defaulters, it in in  
Resolved, That a committee of five!en in every

names of such stiers of the association as shall violate  
their age-nent; and when there shall be an importation  
afgoods into any county, such committee, or any thiee of  
them, are empowered to convene themselves, and in a ci­  
vil manner apply to the merchant or importers concerned,  
and desire to see the invoices and papers respecting such  
importation, and, if they find any goods therein contrary to  
the association, to let the importers know that it is the  
opinion and request of the country that such goods shall  
not be opened or stored, but reshipped to the place from  
whence they came; and in case of refusal, without any  
manner of violence, inform them of the conrequences, and  
proceed to publish an account of their conduct.

Ths. Association entered into last Friday, the 224  
instant, by the gentlemen of the House of Bur­  
gesses and the Body of Merchants assembled in  
this city:  
We, his Majesty&#x27;s most dutiful and loyal sub­  
jects ol Virginia, declaring our inviolable and  
unshaken fidelity and attachment to our gracious  
Sovereign, our affection lor all our lellow sub­  
jects of Great Britain, and our firm determina­  
tion to support, at the hazjrd of our lives and lor­  
tunes, the laws, the peace, anrf good order of go­  
vernment in this colony; but, at the same time,  
affected with gieat and just apprehensions ol the  
fatal consequences certainly to follow from the  
arbitrary imposition ol taxes on the people of  
America, for the purpose of raising a revenue  
from them, without the consent of their represen­  
tatives; and, as we consider it to be the indispen­  
sable duty of every virtuous member of society to  
prevent the ruin and promote the happiness of his  
country by every lawful means, although in the  
prosecution of such a laudable and necessary de­  
sign some unhappy consequences may be derived  
to many innocent fellow-subjects, whom we wish  
  
not to injure, and who, we hope, will impute our  
conduct to the real necessity oI our afiairs. In­  
fluenced by iht*3e reasons, we do most earnestly  
recommend this, our association, to the serious  
attention ol all gentlemen, merchants, traders, and  
other inhabitants ol this colony, not doubting but  
they will readily and cordially accede thereto.?  
And, at the same time, we, and every one ol us,  
do most solemnly oblige ourselves, upon our word

who shall hereafter conform to the spirit of this  
association; hut that we will, upon all occasions,  
and at all times, hereafter avoid purchasing any  
commodity or at tide of goods whatsoever from  
any importer or seller of Urilish merchandise or  
European goods, whom we may know or believe,  
in violation of the essential interests of this colo­  
ny, to ha*e preferred their own private emolu­  
ment, by importing or selling articles prohibited  
by this association, to the destruction of the dear­  
est rights of the people of this colony. And, for  
the more effectual discovery of such defaulters,

goods into any county, such committee, or any  
three of them, are empowered to convene them­  
selves, and in a civil manner apply to the mer­

the invoices anil papets respecting such impor­  
tation, and if they find any goods therein, con­  
trary to the association, to let the importers know  
| that it is the opinion and request of the country  
that such goods shall not be opened or stored,

The dasctution eatered into lost Friday.

 Hous of Burgesses, and the body of Mer­

firm determination to support, at the hazard  
of our lives and fortunes, the laws, the peace,  
 and good order of government in this colony;  
but, at the same time, allected with great and  
just apprehensions of the fatal consequences  
 certainly to follow from the arbitrary imposi­  
tion of taxes on the people of America, for  
e the purpose of raising a revenue from them,  
without the consent of the representatives,  
and, as we consider it to be the indispensable  
duty of every virtuous member to society to  
  
prevent the rain and promote the happiness  
of his country by every lawful means, al-  
though in the prosecution of such a laudabje  
and necessary design some unhappy conse-  
juences may be derived to many innocent  
lellow-subjects, whom we wish not to injure  
and who we hope will impute our conduct to  
the real necessity of our affairs. Influenced  
by these reasons, we do most earnestly recom­  
mend this our association to the scrious atten­

just apprehensions of the fatal consequences cer­  
tainly to follow from the arbitrary imposition of  
taxes on the people of aAmerica, for the purpose of  
  
raising a revenue from them, without the consent

be the indispensable duty of every virtuous mem­

happiness of his country by every lawful means,  
  
although in the prosecution of such a laudable and

earnestly recommend this our association to the se­

ers, and other inhabitants of this colony, not doubt

honor, to promote the welfare and commercial in

cle of goods whatsoever from any importer or sell  
  
er of British merchandise or European goods, whom  
we may know or believe, in violation of the essen

articles pronibited by this assoclation, to the ad­

The Association entered into last Friday, the 20

We, his Maiesty&#x27;s most dutiful and loval sub

Sovereign, our affection for all our fellow-sub

The ASSOCIATION entered into last Friday, the 22nd instant,  
by the Gentlemen of the House of Burgesses, and the Body  
of Merchants, assembled in this city.  
  
\ E his Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects of Vir-  
  
ginia, declaring our inviolable and unshaken fidelity  
and attachment to our gracious sovereign, our affection for  
all our fellow subjects of Great Britain, and our firm deter-  
mination to support, at the hazard of our lives and fortunes,  
the laws, the peace, and good order of government in this  
colony; but at the same time affected with great and just  
apprehensions of the fatal consequences certainly to fol-  
low from the arbitrary imposition of taxes on the people of  
Imerica, for the purpose of raising a revenue from them,  
without the consent of their répresentatives; and as we  
consider it to be the indispensable duty of every virtuous  
member of society to prevent the ruin, and promote the  
happiness, of his country, by every lawful means, although  
in the prosecution of such a laudable and necessary design  
some unhappy consequences may be derived to many in-  
nocent fellow subjects, whom we wish not to injure, and  
who we hope will impute our conduct tothe real necessity  
of our affairs: Influenced by these reasons, we do most  
earnestly recommend this our association to the serious at-  
tention of all Gentlemen merchants, traders, and other in-  
habitants of this colony, not doubting but they will readily  
and cordially accede thereto. And at the same time we,  
and every of us, do most solemnly oblige ourselves, upon  
our word and honor, to promote the welfare and commer-  
cial interests of all those truly worthy merchants, traders,  
and others, inhabitants of this colony, who shall hereafter

upon all occasions, and at all times hereafter, avoid pur-  
chasing any commodity or article of goods whatsoever from  
any importer or seller of British merchandise or European  
goods, whom we may know or believe, in violation of the  
essential interests of this colony, to have preferred their  
own private emolument, by importing or selling articles  
prohibited by this association, to the destruction of the  
dearest rights of the people of this colony. And for the  
more effectual discovery of such defaulters, it is resolved,  
  
That a committee of five be chosen in every county, by  
the majority of associaters in each county, who, or any  
three of them, are hereby authorized to publish the names of  
such signers of the association as shal] violate their agree-  
ment; and when there shall be an importation of goods  
into any county, such committee, or any three of them, are  
empowered to convene themselves, and in a_ civil manner  
apply to the merchant or importers concerned and desire  
to see the invoices and papers respecting such importation,  
and if they find any goods therein contrary to the associa-  
tion to let the importers know that it is the opinion and  
request of the country thatsuch goods shall not be opened  
or stored, but reshipped to the place from whence they  
came: And in case of refusal, without any manner of vio-  
lence, inform them of the consequences, and proceed to  
publish an account of their conduct.  
  
Secondly. That we the subscribers, as well by our own  
example as all other legal ways and means in our power,  
will promote and encourage industry and frugality, and dis-  
courage all manner of luxury and extravagance.  
  
Thirdly. That we will not hereafter, directly or indirectly,  
import, or cause to be imported, from Great Britain, any of  
the goods hereafter enumerated, either for sale of for our  
own use ; to wit, spirits, cider, perry, beer, ale, porter, malt,  
pease, beef, fish, butter, cheese, tallow, candles, fruit, pick-
