On the 25th of November instant, the Honorable Continental Congress passed the following resolve—vizt.  
“Resolved. That General Washington be directed to publish in General orders, that Congress will speedily take into consideration the merits of such officers as have distinguished themselves by their intrepidity and their attention to the health and discipline of their men; and adopt such regulations as shall tend to introduce order and good discipline into the army, and to render the situation of the officers and soldiery, with respect to cloathing and other necessaries, more eligible than it has hitherto been.  
“Forasmuch as it is the indispensible duty of all men, to adore the superintending providence of Almighty God; to acknowledge with gratitude their obligations to him for benefits received, and to implore such further blessings as they stand in need of: and it having pleased him, in his abundant mercy, not only to continue to us the innumerable bounties of his common providence, but also, to smile upon us in the prosecution of a just and necessary war, for the defence of our unalienable rights and liberties”—It is therefore recommended by Congress, that Thursday, the 18th day of December next be set apart for Solemn Thanksgiving and Praise, that at one time, and with one voice, the good people may express the grateful feelings of their hearts, and consecrate themselves to the service of their divine benefactor; and that, together with their sincere acknowledgements and offerings, they may join the penitent confession of their sins; and supplications for such further blessings as they stand in need of—The Chaplains will properly notice this recommendation, that the day of thanksgiving may be duly observed in the army, agreeably to the intentions of Congress.

success that had followed our arms, these  
gentlemen, in drafting the first proclamation  
of Thanksgiving that emanated from the  
Congress of the United States, gave full  
scope to their devotional nature in the in­  
strument which they reported. But in do­  
ing so they knew well the temper of the  
Congress. The proclamation was reported  
by them on November 1, 1777, and was  
adopted without amendment. As the proto­  
proclamation of the Government and as a fit­  
ting memento of the illustrious men who  
framed it, it is here inserted:  
&quot;Forasmuch as it is the indispensable duty of all  
men to adore the superintending providence of Al­  
highty od; to neknowledge with gratitude thelr  
plore such farther bleraings as they ttand in nod  
such farther blessings as they stand in need  
of; and it having pleased Him in his abundant mer.­  
ey not only to continue to us the innumerable  
bounties of His common providence, but also to  
smile upon us in the prosecution of a just and nee.­  
essary war, for the defence and esfablishment of  
our unalienable rights and, liberties; particularly in  
that He hath been pleased in so great a measure to  
prosper the means sed for the support of our  
troops and to crown our arins with most signal suc.­  
cess. It is therefore recommended to the legisla
