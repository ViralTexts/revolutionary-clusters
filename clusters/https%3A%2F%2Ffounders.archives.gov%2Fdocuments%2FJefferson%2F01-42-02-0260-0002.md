An inquiry concerning the Northern Boundaries of Canada &amp; Louisiana  
  
  
  
 By the tenth article of the treaty of Utrecht, (in 1713) Great Britain and France agreed as follows  
  
  
  
  
 France shall restore to Great Britain “the bay and streights of Hudson, together with all lands, seas, sea coasts, rivers and places situate in the said bay and streights, and which belong thereunto, no tracts of land or of sea being excepted, which are at present possessed by the subjects of France.”  
  
  
  
  
 “But it is agreed on both sides to determine within a year, by commissaries, to be forthwith named by each party, the limits which are to be fixed between the said bay of Hudson, &amp; the places appertaining to the French.”  
  
  
  
  
  
 “The same commissaries shall also have orders to describe and settle in like manner the boundaries between the other British and French colonies in those parts.”  
  
  
  
  
 The only information we have of the proceedings under this article, in respect to boundaries, is that of Mr. Hutchins late Geographer, to the United States, in his “Historical narrative &amp; Topographical description of Louisiana and West Florida, printed at Philadelphia in 1784. Mentioning the grant of Louisiana by Louis 14 to Crozat, he says (page 7) “In this grant, the bounds are fixed by the Illinois river, and the lake of that name on the North, by Carolina on the East, the gulph of Mexico, on the South, and New Mexico on the West. As to Canada or New France, The French court would scarcely admit it had any other Northern boundary than the Pole. The avidity of Great Britain was equal, but France having been unfortunate in the war of 1710, the Northern boundary of Canada was fixed by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It assigns New Britain and Hudsons bay on the North of Canada, to Great Britain:   
  
Hutchins’s incorrectness is so notorious that it would be a waste of time to argue on his very words they would probably be found to be very loose expressions of his own very loose ideas. we have an example of it in his account of the grant to Crozat.  
  
  
and commissioners afterwards on both sides ascertained the limits by an *imaginary line, running from a cape or promontory in New Britain, on the Atlantic Ocean in 58 degrees 30. minutes North latitude, thence South West to the lake Misgosink or Mistasim; from thence farther South West directly to the latitude of 49 degrees. All the lands to the North of the imaginary line being assigned to Great Britain and all southward of that line, as far as the River St Lawrence, to the French. These were at that time the true limits of Louisiana and Canada, Crozats grant not subsisting long after the death of Louis 14.”  
*by an imaginary line he means a line defined in writing but not by actual demarcation  
  
  
 On reading the paragraph from Hutchins, the idea which first presented was, that t

 then yet to seek for the Northern boundary of Louisiana; at some period subsequent to the treaty of Utrecht. And the 4th. &amp; 7th. articles of the treaty of 1763 appear to have decided this point.  
  
  
  
  
  
 By the Fourth Article, France cedes to Great Britain: “in full right Canada, with all its dependencies.’ And by the seventh article it is declared that “to remove forever all subject of dispute with regard to the limits of the British and French territories on the continent of America; it is agreed, that for the future, the confines between the dominions of his Britannic majesty and those of his most Christian Majesty, in that part of the world, shall be fixed irrevocably by a line drawn along the middle of the river Mississipi from its source to the river Iberville, &amp; from thence by a line drawn along the middle this river, &amp; the lake Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the sea.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 Now it is presumed to be incontrovertible, that at this time, Great Britain &amp; France supposed the source of the Mississipi to be far North of the 49° of latitude. Mitchells map so extends it; and the American Ministers and those of Great Britain, in fixing the boundaries of the US in the treaty of 1783, it is well known went on that ground.

 its formerly supposed Northern Extent. Mackenzie (general history of the Fur trade) states [“]the Northernmost branch of the source of the Mississipi to be in latitude 47° 38’ North and longitude 95. 6.

h sides grants and settlements are extending &amp; will unavoidably interfere. If Great Britain should not now be disposed to make any difficulty about the North Western boundary yet her situation may probably prevent her attending to a new negociation on the subject, for some time to come: And from the facts and reasons above stated, the result would probably be less favourable to the US than the terms of the present convention.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 If the Convention be not ratified, then the US will be held by the 4th. article of the treaty of Amity and commerce to survey, in conjunction with Great Britain, the river Mississipi, from one degree of latitude below the falls of St Anthony, to its principal source or sources; and also the parts adjacent; and if they do not, (as they will not) find that it would be intersected by a line due West from the Lake of the Woods, why then, after all the labour, delay and expence “the two parties are to proceed by amicable negociation, to regulate the boundary
