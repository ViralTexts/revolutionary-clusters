Sir,  
Head Quarters, Buffalo Sept. 4th. 1814.  
  
Your Letter of the 10th. ultimo after going the rounds, was delivered to me a few days since, on my way to this place.  
The exception you take at my letter to the Secretary, would be very reasonable and proper, provided the fleet of Lake Ontario was your private property, over which the Government had no controul. But as I have been induced to believe that it was the property of the nation; subject to the orders of the Government; and as the Government led me to beleive that  
  
the fleet under your command, would be upon Lake Ontario, to cooperate with my Division of the army, the 1st. week in July; I have deemed it fit and proper to let the nation know, that the support I had a right [to] expect was not afforded me.  
I consider my conduct towards yourself and the Navy, as not only honorable, but, Sir, as being very liberal and friendly, from the date of my report of the Battle at Sacketts-Harbor to the present hour. The troops under my command have always been disposed of, so as to meet your views, to the extent of my power, and authority; and as far as was consistent with the rights and the honor of the Army.  
Your information appears to be very incorrect as to the situation of the army previous to the arrival of reinforcements with Lt. Gen. Drummond. From the 9th. of July to the 24th. the whole country was in our power, from Ft. George to Burlington Heights; and could the army have been supplied with provisions from the Depots provided on the shores of Lake Ontario; we should not have doubted our ability (without reinforcements or additional guns) to carry the Heights: when we could have returned upon Forts George and Niagara, or advance upon Kingston, (as might have been thought most advisable,) with the cooperation of the Fleet.  
You speak of responsibility; I do not desire you, or any man, to be responsible for me. I have endeavour’d to execute the orders given me; success has not attended my endeavours; but I humbly trust in Heaven, that the honor of the brave men intrusted to my command, has been and will be preserved, let what may happen.  
It will be very difficult to retire from Ft. Erie, pressed as the remains of my gallant little army are, by a superior force of the Enemy. But no other alternative will be left us, unless reinforcements speedily arrive. The Militia are coming in, in very considerable numbers, but it is not yet ascertained, how many of them will cross. The Secretary has given me to understand, that Gen. Izard would move to the St. Lawrence, with a view of attacking Kingston, (should he and you deem that measure advisable), Should you decide otherwise, that Gen. Izard would come with, or send to me a Reinforcement of, from two to three thousand men.  
I have not heard from Gen. Izard and begin to apprehend that something has occurred to retard or prevent his movement. I will thank you for any information you can give me on this subject. I am Sir, with great consideration &amp; respect Your most obedt. Servt.

i but, sir, as being very liberal and friendly,  
irom the date ol my report of the battle

views to the extent of my power and au-

the rights and honor ol the army  
  
Your information appears very incor-  
rect £s to the situation of the army pre-  
vious to the arrival of reinforcements with  
Lt. Gen. Drummond. From the ninth of  
July to the 24th the whole country

ble for me. I have endeavored to exe-  
cute the orders given me ; success has  
not attended my endeavors ; but 1 hum-  
bly trust in Heaven, that the honor of the  
brave men entrusted to my con.mand  
iias been and will be preserved, let what  
may happen.  
  
It will be very difficult to retire from  
fort Erie, pressed as the remains of my  
gallant little army are, by a superior force  
of the enemy. But no other alternative  
will be left us, unless reinforcements  
speedily arrive. The militia are coming  
in very considerable numbers, but it is  
not yet ascertained how many of them will  
cross. - The Secrctaiv has given me to  
understand, that Gen. Izard would move  
to the St. Lawrence, with a view of at-  
tacking Kingston, (should he and you  
deem that measure advisable.) Should  
you decide otherwise, that Gen. Izard  
would come with, or send to me a rein-  
forcement of from two to three thousand  
men.  
  
1 have not heard from Gen. Izard, and  
begin to apprehend that something has  
occurred to retard or prevent his move-  
ment. 1 will thank you for any informa-  
tion you can give me on this subject.  
  
I am, sir, with great consideration and  
respect, your most obt. servt.
