At a stated Circuit Court of the United States held for the District of New York at the City of New York on Thursday the fifth day of April One thousand seven hundred and ninety two, at ten of the Clock Ante Meridiem.  
Present The Honorable John Jay Esquire Chief Justice of the United States. The Honorable William Cushing Esquire One of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.  
  
The Honorable James Duane Esquire Judge of the District of New York.  
The Court proceeded to take into consideration the following Act of the Congress of the United States—Vizt  
“An Act to provide for the settlement of the claims of Widows and Orphans barred by the limitations heretofore established, and to regulate the claims to Invalid Pensions.”  
(Here follows the Act, verbatim.)  
The Court was thereupon unanimously of opinion and agreed  
That by the Constitution of the United States the Government thereof is divided into three distinct and independent branches, and that it is the duty of each to abstain from, and to oppose encroachments on either.  
That neither the legislative nor the executive branches, can constitutionally assign to the judicial any duties but such as are properly judicial, and to be performed in a judicial manner.  
That the duties assigned to the Circuit Courts by this Act, are not of that description, and that the Act itself does not appear to contemplate them as such; inasmuch as it subjects the decisions of these Courts made pursuant to those duties, first to the consideration and suspension of the Secretary of War, and then to the revision of the Legislature; Whereas by the Constitution neither the Secretary at War nor any other executive Officer, nor even the Legislature are authorized to sit as a Court of Errors on the Judicial Acts or opinions of this Court.  
As therefore the business assigned to this Court by the Act, is not judicial, nor directed to be performed judicially, the Act can only be considered as appointing Commissioners for the purposes mentioned in it, by Official instead of personal descriptions.  
That the Judges of this Court regard themselves as being the Commissioners designated by the Act, and therefore as being at liberty to accept or to decline that Office.  
That as the Objects of this Act are exceedingly benevolent, and do real honor to the humanity and justice of Congress; And as the Judges desire to manifest on all proper occasions, and in every proper manner their high respect for the national Legislature, they will execute this Act in the capacity of Commissioners.  
That as the legislature have a right to extend the Session of this Court for any term which they might think proper by law to  
  
assign, the term of five days as directed by this act ought to be punctually observed.  
That the Judges of this Court will as usual during the Session thereof adjourn the Court from day to day or other short periods, as circumstances may render proper, and that they will regularly between the Adjournments proceed as Commissioners to execute the business of this Act, in the same Court Room or Chamber.

On the 5th April, 1792, the circuit

sisting of Jay, Chief Justice, Ccshino  
Juttke and Dcauk District Judge,) pro­  
ceeded to take into consideration the

directing the Circuit Courts of the United  
States to receive and examine the applications  
of soldiers of the Revolution to be placed on  
the pension list, and certify them to the Secre-  
tary of War, but several judges refused to act.  
The Circuit Judges of New York, consisting  
of Jay, Chief Justice, and Cushing, Justice,  
held that the act was unconstitutional. ‘ By  
the Constitution of the United States,’’ it was  
said, ‘‘the government thereof is divided into  
three distinct and independent branches, and  
it is the duty of each to abstain from, and to  
oppose encroachments on either. Neither  
the legislature nor the executive branches

ary any duties but such as are properly  
judicial, and to be .performed in a judicial  
manner.’’ Hayburn’s case, 2 Dallas, 409.  
The Supreme Court of New York also held that  
the act was unconstitutional, because it im-  
posed duties upon the court which were not of  
a judicial character, or to be performed in a  
judicial manner. And it was further held,  
that, because the act imposed the duties upon  
the court, the judges could not act as commis-  
sioners, and their acts as such were unauthor-  
ized and void. See Chief Justice Taney’s  
note to U. S. v. Ferveria, 13 Howard, 52. A

Court of the United States in 1851. By

directed to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Dis-  
trict of Pennsylvania, commanding that court to proceed in  
a petition by Hayburn to be put on the pension list of the  
United States in conformity with an act of Congress, ap-  
proved March 23, 1792, c. 11, 1 Stat. 243, which provided for  
the settlement of the claims of widows and orphans barred  
by limitations previously established, and to regulate claims  
to invalid pensions. This court took the case under advise-  
ment, but as Congress provided in another way for the relief  
of invalid pensioners, no decision was made. Nevertheless,  
by a note to Hayburn’s case, we are informed of the views  
expressed at the circuit by different members of this court in  
relation to the act of 1792. They concurred in holding that  
it was not in the power of Congress to assign to the courts of  
the United States any duties except such as were properly  
judicial, and to be performed in a judicial manner; and that  
the duties assigned to the Circuit Courts were not of that  
description, and were not contemplated by the act of Con-  
gress as of that character; and, consequently, that the act  
could be considered as only appointing commissioners for the  
purposes mentioned in it by official instead of personal de-  
scriptions, which positions the judges of the court were at  
liberty to accept or decline.  
  
In a note prepared by Chief Justice Taney, under the  
direction of this court, and found in 13 How. 51, 52, an account  
is given of Todd’s case, which also involved the validity of  
the act of 1792, so far as it imposed upon the Circuit Courts  
duties relating to pensions. And it is there stated that Chief
