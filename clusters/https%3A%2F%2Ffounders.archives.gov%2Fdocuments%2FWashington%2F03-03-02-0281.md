Mrs Phillis,  
Cambridge February 28th 1776.  
  
Your favour of the 26th of October did not reach my hands ’till the middle of December. Time enough, you will say, to have given an answer ere this. Granted. But a variety of important occurrences, continually interposing to distract the mind and withdraw the attention, I hope will apologize for the delay, and plead my excuse for the seeming, but not real, neglect.  
I thank you most sincerely for your polite notice of me, in the elegant Lines you enclosed; and however undeserving I may be of such encomium and panegyrick, the style and manner exhibit a striking proof of your great poetical Talents. In honour of which, and as a tribute justly due to you, I would have published the Poem, had I not been apprehensive, that, while I only meant to give the World this new instance of your genius, I might have incurred the imputation of Vanity. This, and nothing else, determined me not to give it place in the public Prints.  
If you should ever come to Cambridge, or near Head Quarters, I shall be happy to see a person so favourd by the Muses, and to whom nature has been so liberal and beneficent in her dispensations. I am, with great Respect, Your obedt humble servant,

olite notice of me in the elegant lines you  
inclosed, and however undeserving I may  
be of encomium and panegyric, the style  
and manner cxhibita striking proof of your  
poetic al talents, in honor of which, and as  
tribute justly due to you, I would have

might have incurred the imputation of  
vanity. This, aud nothing else, deter­

MIss PHILLIS:  
  
Your favor of the 26th of October  
did not reach my hands till the middle of De-  
cember. Time enough, you will say, to have  
given an answer ere this. Granted. Buta  
variety of important occurrences, continually in-  
terposing to distract the mind and withdraw the  
attention, I hope will apologize for the delay,  
and plead my excuse for the seeming but not  
real neglect. Ithank you most sincerely for  
your polite notice of me in the elegant lines you  
enclosed ; and however undeserving I may be of  
such encomium and panegyric the style and  
manner exhibit a striking proof of your poetical  
talents; in honor of which and as a tribute justly  
due to you, I would have published the poem  
had I not been apprehensive that while I only  
meant to give the world this new instance of  
your genius, I might have incurred the imputa-  
tion of vanity. This, and nothing else, deter-  
mined me not to give it place in the public  
prints.  
  
If you should ever come to Cambridge or near  
headquarters, I shall be happy to see a person  
so favoured by the Muses, and to whom nature  
has been so liberal and beneficent in her dispen-  
sations. I am with great respect,  
  
Your obedient humble servant,  
GEORGE WASHINGTON
