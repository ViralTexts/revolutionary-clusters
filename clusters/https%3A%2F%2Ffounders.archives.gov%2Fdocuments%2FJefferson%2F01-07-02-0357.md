Enclosure  
Reasons in support of the new proposed articles in the Treaties of commerce‥‥  
By the original Law of Nations war and extirpation was the punishment of injury. Humanizing by degrees, it admitted slavery instead of death. A farther step was the exchange of prisoners instead of slavery. Another, to respect more the property of private persons under conquest, and be content with acquired dominion. Why should not this Law of Nations go on improving? Ages have intervened between its several steps; but as knowledge of late encreases rapidly, why should not those steps be quickened? Why should it not be agreed to as the future law of Nations that in any war hereafter the following discriptions of men should be undisturbed, have the protection of both sides, and be permitted to follow their employments in surety, viz.  
  
  
1. Cultivators of the earth, because they labour for the subsistance of mankind.  
2. Fishermen, for the same reason.  
3. Merchants and Traders in unarmed ships; who accomodate different Nations by communicating and exchanging the necessaries and conveniencies of life.  
4. Artists and Mechanics inhabiting and working in open towns.  
  
  
It is hardly necessary to add that the Hospitals of Enemies should be unmolested, they ought to be assisted.  
It is for the interest of humanity in general, that the occasions of war, and the inducements to it should be diminished.  
If rapine is abolished, one of the encouragements to war is taken away, and peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting. The practice of robbing merchants on the high seas, a remnant of the antient piracy, tho’ it may be accidentally beneficial to particular persons, is far from being profitable to all engaged in it or to the nation that authorizes it. In the beginning of a war some rich ships, not upon their guard, are surprized and taken. This encourages the first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels, and many others to do the same, but the Enemy at the same time, become more careful, arm their merchant ships better and render them not so easy to be taken; they go also more under the protection of convoys. Thus while the privateers to take them are multiplied, the vessels subject to be taken and the chances of profit are diminished, so that many cruises are made wherein the expences overgo the gains; as it is the case in other lotteries, tho’ particulars have got prizes the mass of Adventurers are losers, the whole expence of fitting out all the privateers during a war, being much greater than the whole amount of goods taken. Then there is the national loss of all the labour of so many men during the time they have been employed in robbing; who besides spend what they get in riot, drunkenness, and debauchery, lose their habits of industry, are rarely fit for any sober business after a peace, and serve only to encrease the number of Highwaymen and House-breakers. Even the Undertakers who have been fortunate, are by sudden wealth led into expensive living, the habit of which continues, when the means of supporting it cease, and finally ruins them. A just punishment for their having wantonly and unfeelingly ruined many honest innocent Traders and their families, whose substance was employed in serving the common interests of Mankind

‘ The practice of robbing merchants on the high seas, a remnant  
of the ancient piracy, though it may be accidentally beneficial to  
particular persons, is far from being profitable to all engaged in it,  
or to the nation that authorizes it. In the beginning of a war,  
some rich ships not upon their guard are surprized and taken.  
This encourages the first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels,  
and many others to do the same. - But the enemy at the same time  
become more careful, arm their merchant-ships better, and render  
them not so easy to be taken; they go also more under protection  
of convoys ; thus, while the privateers to take them are multiplied,  
the vessels subject to be taken and the chances of profit are dimi-  
nished, so that many cruizes are made wherein the expences  
overgo the gains ; and as is the case in other lotteries, though par-  
ticulars have got prizes, the mass of adventurers are losers, the  
whole expence of fitting out all the privateers during a war being  
much greater than the whole amount of goods taken. Then there  
is the national loss of all the labour of so many men during the  
time they have been ere in robbing ; who besides spend  
what they get in riot, drunkenness, and debauchery, lose their  
habits of industry, are rarely fit for any sober business after a  
  
eace, and serve only to increase the number of highwaymen and  
  
ousebreakers. Even the undertakers who have been fortunate  
are by sudden wealth led into expensive living, the habit of which  
continues when the means of supporting it cease, and finally ruins  
them. A just punishment for their having wantonly and unfeel-  
ingly ruined many honest innocent traders and their families,  
whose subsistence was employed in serving the common interests  
  
of mankind.’ P. 420, 421

‘It is for the interest of humanity in general, that the occasions  
of war, and the inducements to it should be diminished.  
  
‘If rapine is abolished, one of the encouragements to war is  
taken away, and peace therefore more likely to continue and be

‘ ‘Lhe practice of robbing merchants on the high seas, a remnant  
  
of the ancient piracy though it may be accidentally beneficial to  
particular persons, is far from being profitable to all engaged in  
it, or tothe nation that authorizes it. In the beginning ofa war,  
some rich ships, not upon their guard, are surprized and taken.  
This encourages the first adventurers to fit out more armed ves-  
sels, and many others to do the same. But the enemy at the  
same time become more careful, arm their merchant ships better ;  
and render them not so easy to be taken; they go also more un-  
der protection of convoys: thus while the privateers to take  
them are multiplied, the vessels subject to be taken and the chan-  
ces of profit are diminished, so that many cruizes are made  
wherein the expences overgo the gains; and as is the case in  
other lotteries, though particulars have got prizes. the mass of  
adventurers are losers, the whole expense of fitting out all the  
privateers during a war, being much greater than the whole  
amount of goods taken. Then there is the national loss of all the  
labour of so many men during the time they have been employed  
in robbing; who besides spend what they get in riot, drunken-  
ness, and debauchery, lose their habits of industry, are rarely fit  
for any sober business after a peace, and serve only to increase  
the number of highwaymen and house-breakers. Even the un-  
dertakers who have been fortu: ate, are by sudden wealth led in-  
io expensive living, the habit of which continues when the means  
of supporting it ceases, and finally ruins them. A just punish-

of the encouragements to war is taken away,  
and peace, therefore, more likely to continue, and  
be lasting. The practice of robbing merchants  
on the high seas, a remnant of the ancient pi­  
racy, though it may be accidentally beneficial  
to particular persons, is far from being profitable  
to all engaged in it, or to the nation that author­  
izes it. In the beginning of a war, some rich  
ships, not on their guard, are surprized and taken.  
This encourages the first adventurer to fit out  
more armed vessels, and many others to do the  
same. But the enemy, at the same time, be­  
come more careful, arm their merchant ships  
better, and render them not so easy to he taken :  
they go also more under the protection of convoys.  
Thus, while the privateers to take them are mul­  
tiplied, the vessels subject to be taken, and the  
chances of profit are diminished, so that many  
cruises are made wherein the expenses average  
the gains ; aud, as is the case in other lotteries,
