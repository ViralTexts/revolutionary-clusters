To the House of Representatives    
  
  
of the United States.  
Feb. 4. 1808.  
  
In my message of January 20. I stated that some papers forwarded by mr Daniel Clark of New Orleans to the Secretary of State in 1803. had not then been found in the office of State: and that a letter had been addressed to the former Chief Clerk, in the hope that he might advise where they should be sought for. by indications recieved from him they are now found. among them are two letters from the Baron de Carondelet to an officer serving under him at a separate post, in which his views of a dismemberment of our Union are expressed. extracts of so much of these letters as are within the scope of the resolution of the House are now communicated. with these were found the letters written by mr Clarke to the Secretary of State in 1803. a part of one only of these relates to this subject, and is extracted and inclosed for the information of the House. in no part of the papers communicated by mr Clarke, which are voluminous and in different languages, nor in his letters, have we found any intimation of the corrupt reciept of money by any officer of the US. from any foreign agent. as to the combinations with foreign agents for dismembering the union, these papers &amp; letters offer nothing which was not probably known to my predecessors, or which could call anew for enquiries which they had not thought necessary to institute, when the facts were recent and could be better proved. they probably believed it best to let pass into oblivion transactions which, however culpable, had commenced before this government existed, and had been finally extinguished by the treaty of 1795.

To the House of Representatives  
Of the United States.  
In my meflage of January 20, I  
stated that some papers forwarded by  
Mr. Daniel Clark of New.OQrleans, to  
the Secretary of State in 1803, had  
not then been found in the office of  
State ; and that a letter had been ad­  
drefled to the former chief clerk,|in  
the hope that he might advise whtre  
they should bedought for. By indi­  
cations from him they are now found.  
Among them are two letters from the  
Baron de Carondelet to an officer  
serving under him at a separate pok ;  
in which his views of a dismember-.  
ment of our union are expressed.—  
Extra&amp;ls of so much of these letters ag  
are within the scope of the resolution  
of the House are now communicated,  
With these were found the letters  
written by Mr. Clark to the Secretary  
of slate in 1803, A part of one only  
of these relates to this fubje@, and. is  
extradted and enclosed for the infor­  
mation of the House. In no part of  
the papers communicated by Mr.  
Clark, which are voluminous, and in  
different languages, ner in his letters,  
have we found any information of the  
corrupt receipt of money by any offi­  
cer of the U. S. from any foreign a­  
gents for dismembering the union ;  
thele papers or letters offer nothing  
which was not probably known tomy  
predeceffors,or which would call anew  
for enquiries, which they had not  
thought neceffury to institute, when  
the faéts were recent, and conld be  
better proved. They probably be­  
lieved it best to let pass into oblivion  
tranfa&amp;ions which, however culpable,  
had commenced before this, govern­  
ment existed, and had been finally ex­  
‘tinguifhed by the treaty of 17g5s.
