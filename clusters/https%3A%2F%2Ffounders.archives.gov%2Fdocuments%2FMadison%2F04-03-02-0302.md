acancy, by resignation or otherwise, should permit his appointment to a similar grade in the line. He was at the same time named to the command of Military District No. 7, of which New Orleans made a part. This proposition in both its branches, the promissory as well as the appointing, was approved by the President, and a communication to General Jackson made accordingly. On the twenty second of May, General Harrison’s resignation was received at the War Office, and on the day following, was reported to the President, as furnishing means for giving immediate execution to the promise already stated. The President’s answer was indecisive. ‘The better way,’ says he, ‘will be to send on a Major General’s commission at once; but on this I suspend a final decision ‘till I see you.’ The Secretary, on the other hand, not believing that a right to tamper with engagements solemnly made and communicated, existed any where, or for any length of time, hastened to act on what appeared to be the first impression of the President; immediately forwarded the commission; and took on himself the responsibility of doing so.”

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th. of June last. The case you put is a very strong one, &amp; if all the circumstances stated by you unite, the conclusion is inevitable.  
It becomes our duty to carry our arms where we find our Enemies. It is beleived and I am so directed by the President to say, that there is a disposition on the part of the Spanish Govt. not to break with the United States, nor to encourage any conduct on the part of her subordinate Agents, haveing a tendency to such rupture. We must therefore in this case be careful to ascertain facts &amp; even to distinguish between what, on the part of the Spanish Authorities may be the effect of menace &amp; compulsion, or of choice &amp; policy.  
The result of this enquiry must govern. If they admit, feed, arm and cooperate with the British &amp; hostile Indians, we must strike on the broad principle of Self-preservation. Under other and different circumstances, we must forbear. I have the honour &amp;c

ed the following letter from general Armstrong, the then Secretary at  
War:  
  
“The case you put isa very strong one: and if ail the cizycumstances sia-  
ted by you unite; the conclusion is irresistible. J¢ becomes our duty to car-  
vy our arms wherever we find our enemies. It is believed, and I am so di-  
Fected by the President to say, that there is a disposition on the part of  
the Spanish gevernment not to break with the Uni-ed States, nor to en-  
courage any conduct on the part of her subordinate agents, having a ten-  
déncy tosuch rupture. We must therefore in this case be careful to as-  
  
certain facts, and even to distinguish what, on the part of the Spanish au-  
‘thorities, may be the effect of menace and compulsion, or of their choice  
  
and policv. The result of this inquiry must govern. Jf they admit, feed,  
arm, and co-operate with the British and hostile Indians, we must strike on, the  
broad principle of self preservation: —under other and different circumstan-  
ces we must forbear.’ ”

The following statement, made from documents of the highest  
character, will, we believe, settle this question. Early in the  
month of May, 1814, the then Secretary of War proposed to confer  
on Gen. Jackson, the appointment of Brigadier in the army of the  
United States, with the brevet rank of Major-General, until a va

to a similar grade in the line. He was, at the same time, named to  
the command of military district No. 7, of which New-Orleans made  
apart. This proposition, in both its branches, the promissory as  
well as the appointing, was approved by the President, and a com-  
munication to Gen. Jackson made accordingly. On the 22d of May,  
Gen. Harrison’s resignation was received at the War-Oflice, and on  
the day following was reported to the President, as furnishing means  
for giving immediate execution to the promise already stated. The  
President’s answer was indecisive—‘* The better way,” says he,  
‘*¢ will be to send on a Major General’s commission at once ; but on  
this I suspend a final decision till I see you.”* ‘The Secretary, on  
the other hand, not believing that a right to tamper with engage-  
ments solemnly made and communicated, existed any where, or for  
any length of time, hastened to act on what appeared to be the first  
impression of the President—immediately forwarded the commission,
