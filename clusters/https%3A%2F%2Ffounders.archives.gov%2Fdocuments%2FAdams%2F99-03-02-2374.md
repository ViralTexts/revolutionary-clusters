N. 17.  
My Dear Son.  
St: Petersburg 14 September 1813  
  
The fourth and last point of view, in which I proposed to offer you some general observations upon the sacred Scriptures, was with reference to Literature. And the first remark which presents itself here is that the five Books of Moses, are the most antient monument of written language, now extant in the World—The Book of Job is nearly of the same date, and by many of the Christian and Jewish Commentators is believed to have been written by Moses.  
The employment of alphabetical characters to represent all the articulations of the human voice, is the greatest invention that ever was compassed by human Genius—Plato says that it was the discovery either of a God, or of a man divinely inspired—The Egyptians ascribed it to That, whom the Greeks afterwards worshipped under the name of Hermes—This however is a fabulous origin—That it was an Egyptian invention there is little reason to doubt, and it was a part of that learning of the Egyptians, in all of which we know that Moses was versed.  
It is probable that when Moses wrote, this Art was if not absolutely of recent, yet of no very remote invention—There was but one copy of the Law written in a Book; it was deposited in the Ark of the Covenant; and was read aloud once in seven years, to all the People at their general Assembly in the feast of tabernacles. Deut: XXXI. 9. 10.—25.26.—There was one other copy, written upon stones, erected on mount Ebal. Deut. XXVII. 3–8.—It does not appear that there existed any other copies—In process of time, the usage of reading it every seven years must have been dropp’d, and the monument upon mount Ebal must have perished—For in the reign of Josiah (II. Kings. XXII.) about eight hundred years afterwards, the Book of the Law was found in the Temple—How long it had been lost is not expressly told; but from the astonishment and consternation of Josiah upon hearing the book read, its contents must have been long forgotten, so that scarcely a tradition of them remained—We are indeed told I Kings VIII.9. and II Chron: V. 10. that when the Ark of the Covenant was deposited in the Temple of Solomon, “there was Nothing in the ark, save the two tables, which Moses put therein at Horeb.” The two tables contained, not the whole Law, but only the ten Commandments (Deut. V. 22.—X. 4. 5.) The Book of the Law, was therefore no longer in the Ark, at the Dedication of Solomon’s Temple; that is about 500 years the Law was given, and 300 years before the Book was found by Hilkiah the High-Priest in the 18th: year of Josiah.  
From these Circumstances, as well as from the expedients used by Moses and Joshua, for preserving the memorial of the Law, and the repeated Covenants, between God and the People (Deut: V.2. X.I. XXIX.I Joshua XXIV.25.) it is obvious that the art and the practice of writing were extremely rare—that very few of the People were ever taught to read; that there were few books extant, and of those few only single copies.  
The Arts of writing, speaking and thinking, with their several modifications of Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic, were never cultivated among the Hebrews, as they were, though not untill nearly a thousand years later than Moses, among the Greeks—Philosophical research, and the Spirit of Analysis, appears to have belonged among the Antient Nations exclusively to the Greeks—They studied language as a Science, and from the discoveries they made in this pursuit, resulted a system of literary composition founded upon logical deductions—The language of the sacred writers was not constructed upon the foundation of abstruse Science—It partakes of the nature of all primitive language, which is almost entirely figurative; and in some degree of the character of primitive writing and of hieroglyphics—We are not told from what materials Moses compiled the Book of Genesis, which contains the History of the Creation, and of three thousand years succeeding it, and which terminates three Generations prior to the birth of Moses himself.—Whether he had it altogether from tradition, or whether he collected it from more antient written or painted memorials. The Account of Creation, of the Fall, and all the antedeluvian part of the History carries strong internal evidence of having been copied or if I may so express myself, translated from hieroglyphical or symbolical records—The narrative is of the most perfect simplicity—the discourses of the persons introduced are given as if taken down verbatim from their mouths, and the narrative is scarcely any thing more than the connecting link of the discourses—The Genealogies are given with great precision, and this is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the Old Testament—The rest is all figurative—The Rib, the Garden, the Trees of life, and of the knowledge of Good and Evil, the Apple, the Serpent, are all images, which seem to indicate a hieroglyphical origin  
All the historical Books both of the Old and new Testament retain the peculiar characteristics that I have noticed—the simplicity and brevity of the Narrative—the practice of repeating all discourse, as in the identical words spoken, and the constant use of figurative, symbolical and allegorical language—But of the Rules of composition prescribed by the Grecian Schools, the unities of Aristotle, or the congruities of figures taught by the Greek philologists, not a feature is to be seen—The Psalms are a collection of Songs—The song of Solomon is a Pastoral Poem; the Proverbs are a collection of moral sentences and maxims, apparently addressed by Solomon to his Son, with the addition of some others of the same description—The prophetical Books are partly historical, and partly poetical—They contain the narrative of the Visions, and other Revelations of the Deity to the Prophets who recorded them—In the New Testament, the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are historical—They contain memoirs of the life of Christ, and some of his discourses; and the proceedings of his principal Apostles for some years immediately after his decease—The simplicity of the narrative is the same as that of the Old Testament; the style in general indicates an age when reading and writing had become more common, and books more multiplied—The Epistles of St: Paul are the productions of a mind educated to the learning of the age, and well versed even in the Grecian Literature—From his History it appears that he was not only capable of maintaining an Argument with the Doctors of the Jewish Law, but of discussing Principles with the Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers—His Speech at Athens, as a specimen of Eloquence was worthy of an Audience in the native Country of Demosthenes—The Apocalypse of St: John, resembles in many Respects some of the prophetical Books of the Old Testament—The figurative, symbolical and Allegorical Language of these Books, shew a range of Imagination, suitable only to be the record of Dreams and Visions—their meaning is in many parts inexplicably obscure—It has been and is to this day among the follies and vices, of many Sects of Christians to attempt explanations of them adapted to Sectarian purposes and opinions. The style of none of the Books either of the old or new Testament, affords a general model for imitation to a writer of the present age—The principles and rules of composition derived from the Greek and Roman Schools, and the examples of their principal writers, have been so generally adopted in modern literature, that the style of the Scriptures, differing so essentially from them could not be imitated without great affectation—But for pathos of narrative—for the selection of incidents that go directly to the heart—for the picturesque of character and manners; the selection of circumstances that mark the individuality of persons; for copiousness, grandeur and sublimity of imagery, for unanswerable cogency and closeness of reasoning and for irresistible force of persuasion, no Book in the world deserves to be so unceasingly studied, and so profoundly meditated upon as the Bible.  
I shall conclude here the series of letters, which I purposed about two years since to write you, for the purpose of exhorting you to Search the Scriptures, and of pointing out to your Consideration the general points of application with a view to which, I thought this Study might be made profitable to the improvement and usefulness of your future life—There are other and particular points, to which I may hereafter occasionally invite your attention—I am sensible how feeble and superficial, what I have written has been; and every letter has convinced me more and more of my incompetency to the adequate performance of the task I had assumed—But my great object was to shew you the importance of devoting your own faculties to this pursuit. To read the Bible is of itself a laudable occupation, and can scarcely fail of being an useful employment of Time—But the habit of reflecting upon what you have read is equally essential as that of reading itself to give it all the efficacy of which it is susceptible—I therefore now recommend it to you to set apart a small portion of every day to read one or more Chapters of the Bible, and always to read it with reference to some particular train of observation or of reflection—In these letters I have suggested to you four general ones—considering the Scriptures as Divine Revelations—as Historical Records—as a System of Morals—and as literary Compositions—but there are many others points of view in which they may be  subjects of useful investigation—As an expedient for fixing your own attention, make it also a practice for some time to minute down in writing your reflections upon what you read from day to day—You may perhaps at first find this irksome, and your reflections themselves scanty and unimportant—but they will soon become both easy and copious. And be careful above all, not to let your reading make you either a pedant or a bigot—let it never puff you up with a conceited opinion of your own knowledge, or make you intolerant of the opinions which others drew from the same source; however different from your own—And may the merciful Creator who gave the Scriptures for our Instruction, bless your study of them, and make them to you fruitful of good works!—  
from your affectionate father.

posed to offer you some gener  
Scriptures, was with reference to literature  
and the first remark that presents itself is, that the  
oke of Moses are the most ancient mon  
ts of written language now extant  
f the same date, and by  
Jewish and Christiar  
written by Moses. The  
employmont of alphabetical characters to  
an voice, is the

man genius. Plato says &quot;that it was the discovery  
lod, or a man divinely inspired.&quot; The  
ans ascribed it to Thot, whom the Greeks  
afterward worshiped under the name of Hermes.  
it, is, however a fabulous origin. That it was an  
Lepptian invention there is little doubt, and it was  
apart of that learning of the Egyptians, in all of  
we are told &quot;Moses was versed.&quot; It is  
ses wrote, this act was, if  
a absolutely recent, of no very remote invention.  
was but one copy of the law written in a  
the Covenant,  
was read aloud once in seven years, to all the  
al assembly in the Feast of  
is there was one other copy of the law,  
in Mount Ebal. It  
s not appear that there existed any other copies.  
usage of reading it thus must  
een dropped, and the monument upon Mount  
ust have perished, for in the reign of Jo  
siah, about 800 years afterward, the book of the  
w was found in the temple How long it had been  
st is not expressly told, but from the as  
ment and consternation of Josiah upon hearing the  
book read, its contents must have long been for  
ten, so that scarcely a tradition of them remain  
We are indeed told that when the Ark of the  
enant was deposited in the temple of Solomor  
was nothing in the ark save the two tables  
Moses put therein at Horeb. The two tables

the 18th year of Josiah. From  
imstances, as well as from the expedients  
ised by Moses and Joshua, for I  
ionial law and the repeated covenant be  
tween God and the people, it is observed that the  
art and practice of writing was extremely rare  
and that vary few of the people were even taught  
to read, that there were few books extant, and of  
those few, only single copies, the art of writin­  
speaking and thinking with their several modifica  
tions of grammar, rhetoric and logic, were never  
taltivated among the Hebrews, as they were  
sthough not till a thousand years later than Moses  
among the Greeks. Philosophical research, and  
the spirit of analy sis appeared to have belonged  
among the ancient nations exclusively to the  
Oreeks they studied language as a scier  
m the discoveries they made in this pursuitr  
fulted a system of literary compositions founded  
pon logical deductions. The lang  
cient writers was not constructed upon the founda  
tion of abstruse science, it partakes of the nature  
of all primitive languages, which is almost entirely  
figurative; and in some degree of the character of  
primitive writing and hieroglyphics. We are not  
told from what materials Moses compiled the Book  
Genesis, (which contains the history of the crea  
tion, and of 300 years succeeding it, which term  
astes three generations prior to the birth of Moses  
self,) whether he had it altogether from tradi  
tion, or whether he collected it from the more an  
cient written or printed memorials. The account  
f the creation, of the fall of man, and all the anti  
tiluvian part of the history, carries strong interna&#x27;  
evidences of having been copied or fif I may ex  
as my self, translated from hieroglyphic or sym  
bolical record, the story is of the most perfect  
simplicity, the discourses of the persons introduced  
are given as if taken down verbatim from their  
moutha, and the narrative is scarcely anything  
ore than the connecting link of the discourses;  
the genealogies are given with great precision, and  
is is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of  
Old Testament; the rest is all figurative; the  
Rib, the Garden, the Tree of Life and the Know!  
edge of Good and Evil, the Apple, the Serpent ars  
all images which seem to indicate a hicroglyphic  
origin. All the historical books, both of the Old and  
New Testaments, retain the peculiar characteristics  
that I have noticed; the simplicity and brevity of  
arrative, the practice of repeating all dis  
courses in the identical words spoken, and the  
stant use of figurative symbolical and al  
langusge. But of the rules of composition, pre  
scribed by the Grecian schoole, the unities or Aris  
 of agures taught by the  
ists not a feature is to be seen.­  
The Psalms are a collection of songs the s  
Solomon is a pastoral Poem; the Proverbs are a  
tion of moral sentences and maxims appar­  
ently addressed by Solomon to his son, with the  
thers of the same description the  
tical books are partly historical and partly  
poetical--they contain the narative of visions and  
revelations of the Deity to the Prophets who re.  
corded them. In the New Testament the four Gos  
pels and the Acts of the Apostles are historical,  
they contain memories of the life of Christ and  
some of His apostles, and the proceedings of some  
of His principal apostles, for some years after  
His decease. The simplicity of the narrative is the  
same as that of the Old Testament the style in  
general indicates an age when reading and writing­  
had become more common and books more multi  
plied. The Epistles of Paul are the productions of a  
mind educated in the learning of the age and we­  
versed in the Grecian literature from his history it  
appears that he was not only capable of maintain  
ing an argument with the Doctors of the Jewish  
law, but  of discussing principles with  
and Epicurean philonophers, his speech at a  
is a specimen of eloquend  
in the native country of Demosthenes. The Apoca  
lypse of John resembles in many respects some of  
the prophetical books of the Old Testament, the  
figurative symbolical and allegorical language of  
these books, show a range of imagination suitable  
only to be the record of dreams and visions--their  
  
language is in many parts inexplicably obscure.  
It has been, and it is to this day, among the  
es of many sects of Christians to attempt  
explanations of them adapted to sectarian purpose.  
and opinions. The style of none of the books either  
of the Old or New Testament, affords ag  
itation to a writer of the present ag  
les and rules

rincipal writers, have  
iptures

without great affectation; but for pathes  
of narrative; for the selections of incidents that

 stances that mark the individuality of persons,I  
copiousness, grandeur and sublimity of

osed about two years ago to write  
r the purpose of exhorting you to sea  
ares, and of pointing out to your consid  
neral points of application with a viewt  
ught this stue  
sefulness of  
ture life. There are other and particular points to  
which I may hereafter occasionally invite your at  
I am sensible how feeble and supt  
what I have written has been, and every letter has  
ed me more andd  
tency to the adequate performance of the task I  
had assumed; but my great object was t  
you the importance of evoting your own facultics  
to this pursuit to read the Bible is of itself a  
supation and  
but the habit  
upon what you have read is equally essential as  
that of reading itself to give it all the efficacy of  
which it is susceptible. I  
set apart a small portion of every day to  
s of the Bible, and always  
read it with reference to some particular train of  
 observation or reflection. In these letters I have  
ated to you four general ones. Consic  
the Scriptures as Divine Revelations; as historical  
is; as a system of morale; and as  
compositions. There are many other points of view  
whichthey may be subjects ofusefuli  
As an expedient for fixing your attention, make  
it also a practice for some time to minute dow  
writing your reflections upon what you read from.  
day to day, you may perhaps at first find this irk  
some, and your reflections scanty and unimport ant  
but they will soon become both easy and copiovs  
Be careful of all not to let your reading make you  
a pedant, or a bigot, let it never puff you up with  
pride, or a conceited opinion of your own know!  
edge, nor make you intolerant of the opinions which  
others draw from the same source, however differ  
ent from your own. And may the merciful Creater,  
who gave the Scriptures for our instruction, bless  
your study of them, and mgke them to you &quot;fraitt

The fourth aud last point of view in which  
I proposed to offer you some general observa-  
tions upon the Scriptures, was with reference  
to literature ; and the first remark that presents  
itself is, that the five books of Moses are the  
most ancient monuments of written language  
now extant in the world; the book of Job is  
nearly of the same date, and by many of the  
Jewish and Christian commentators is thought  
to have been written by Moses. —  
  
The employment of alphabetical characters  
to represent all the articulations of the haman  
voice. is the greatest invention that ever was  
compassed by human genius. Plato says, “that  
it was the discovery either of, a God, of a man  
divinely inspired.” The Egyptians ascribed it  
to Thot, whom the Greeks afterward worship-  
ped under the name of Hermes. ‘This is, how-  
jever, a fabulous origin. ‘That it was an Egyp-  
| tian invention there is litile doubt ; and it was a  
| part of that learning of the Egyptians, in all of  
which we are told ‘*Moses was versed.” It is  
probable that when Moses wrote, this art was,  
if not absolutely recent, of no very remote in-  
vention.  
  
There was but one copy of the law written  
in a book, it was deposited in the Ark of the  
Covenant, and was read aloud once in seven  
years, to all the people at their general assem-  
bly, in the Feast of Tabernacles ; there was one  
other copy of the law, written upon stone, erect-  
ed on Mount Ebal. It does not appear that there  
existed any other copies. In process of time  
the usage of reading it thus must have been  
diopped, and the monument upon Mount Ebal  
must have perished ; for in the reign of Josiah,  
about 800 years afterward, the book of the law  
was found in the temple. How long it had  
been Jost is not expressly to&#x27;d ; but from the as-  
tonishment and consternation of Josiah upon  
hearing the book read, its contents must have  
long been forgotten, so that scarcely a tradition  
of them remained. We are indeed told that  
when the Ark of the Covenant was deposited in  
the Temple of Solomon, there was nothing it  
the ark save the two tables which Moses put  
therein at Horeb. The two tables contained not  
the whole law, but the ten commandments: the  
bouk of the law was therefore no longer in the  
Ark, at the dedication of Solomon’s Temple ;  
that is,about 500 years after the law was given,  
and 300 before the book was found by Hezekiah  
high priest in the 19th year of Josiah. From  
these circumstances, as well as from the expe-  
dients used by Moses and Joshua, for preserving  
the ceremonial law and the repeated covenant  
between God and the people, it is observed that  
the art and practice of writing was extremely  
rare, and that very few of the people were even  
taught to read; tnat there were few books ex-  
tant, and of those few, only single copies ; the  
art of writing, speaking and thinking with their  
several modifications of grammar, rhetoric and  
logic, were never cultivated among the Hebrews  
as they were (though not till a thousand years  
Jater than Moses) among the Greeks. Philo-  
sophical research, and the spirit of analysis ap-  
peared to have belonged among the ancient na-  
tions exclusively ‘to the Greeks; they studied  
language as a science, and from the discoveries  
they made in this pursuit, resulted a system of  
literary compositions founded upon logical de-  
ductions, The language of the ancient writers  
was not constructed upon the foundation of ab-  
strnse science ; it partakes of the nature of all  
primitive languages, which is almost entirely  
figurative ; and in some degree of the character  
of primitive writing and hieroglyphics.  
  
We ure not told from what materials Moses  
compiled the Book of Genesis, (which contains  
the history of the creation, and of 300 years  
succeeding it, which terminates three genera-  
tions prior to the birth of Moses himself;) wheth-  
er he had it altogether from tradition, or wheth-  
er he collected it from the more ancient written  
or printed memorials. ‘The account of the crea-  
tion, of the fall of man, and all the antediluvian  
part of the history, carries strong internal evi-  
dences of having been copied or (if I may ex-  
press myself) translated from hieroglyphic ot  
symbolical record ; the story is of the most per-  
fect simplicity, the discourses of the persons in-  
troduced are given as if taken down verbatim  
from their mouths, and the narrative is scarcely  
anything more than the connecting link of the  
discourses; the genealogies are given wijh great  
precision ; and this is one of the most remarka-  
  
  
  
ble peculiarities of the Oid Testament ; the rest  
  
seem to indicate a hieroglyphic origin. All the  
historical books, both of the Old and New Testa-  
ments, retain the peculiar characteristics that |  
have noticed ; the simplicity and brevity of the  
narrative, the practice of repeating all discourses  
in the identical words spoken, and the constant  
use of figurative, symbolical and allegorical lan-  
guage. Butof the rules of composition, pre-  
scribed by the Grecian schools, the unities of  
Aristotle, or the congruities of figures taught by  
the Greek philologists, not a feature is to be  
seen, The Psalms are a collection of songs ;  
the Song of Solomon is a pastoral Poem ; the  
  
maxims apparently addressed by Solomon to his  
  
scription ; the Prophetical books are partly his-  
torical and partly poetical—they contain the nar-  
rative of visions and revelations of the Deity to  
the Prophets who recorded them. In the New  
Testament, the four Gospels and the Acts of  
the Apostles are historical,—they contain me-  
moirs of the life of Christ and some of His apos-  
tles, and the proceedings of some of His apos-  
tles, for some years after His decease. ‘The  
simplicity of the narrative is the same as that of  
the Old Testament; the style in general indi-  
cates an age when reading and writing had be-  
come more common, and books more smultiplied-  
The Epistles of Paul are the productions of a  
mind educated in the learning of the age, and  
well versed in the Grecian literature ; from his  
history it appears that he was not only capable  
of maintaining an argument with the Doctors of  
the Jewish law, but of discussing principles with  
the Stoic and Epicurean philosophers; his speech  
at Athens is a specimen of eloquence worthy of  
an audience in the native country of Demosthe-  
nes. The Apocalypse of John resembles in  
many rongewts some of the prophetical books of  
the Old Testament ; the figurative, symbolical  
and ahegereel language of these books, show a  
range of imagination suitable only to be the rec-  
ord of dreams and vi ir langeage is in  
many parts inexplicably obscure. It has been  
and it is to this day, among the follies and vices  
of many sects of Christians to attempt explana-  
tions of them adapted to sectarian purposes and  
opinions.  
  
The style of none of the books, either in the  
} a general model  
for imitation to a writer of the present age ; the  
principles and rules for composition derived from  
Greek and Roman schools, and the example of  
their principal writers, have been so generally  
adopted in modern literature, that the Scriptures  
—differing so essentially from them—could not  
be imitated without great affectation: but for  
pathos of narrative ; for the selections of inci-  
dents that go direetly to the heart ; for the pic-  
turesque of character and manner ; the selection  
of circumstances that mark the individuality of  
persons ; for copiousness, grandeur and sublim-  
ity of imagery; for unanswerable cogency and  
closeness of reasoning ; and for irresistible force  
  
be so unceasingly studied, and so profoundl  
meditated aoa or the Bible. 2 :  
I shall conclude here the series of letters,  
which I about two years ago to wriie  
you for the purpose of exhorting you to search  
the Scriptures, and of poiuting out to your con-  
sideration the general points of application; with  
a view to which, I thought this study might be

fal employment of time; but the habit of reflect-  
ing upon what you have read is equally essen-  
tial as that of reading itself, to give it all the ef-  
ficacy of which it is susseptible. I therefore  
recommend to you, to set apart a small portien  
of every day to read one or more chapters in the  
Bible, and always read it with reference to  
some particular train of observation or reflection.  
In these letters I have suggested to you four  
eneral ones. Considering the Scriptures as  
Jivine Revelations ; a8 historical records ; as @  
system of morals ; and as literary compositions.  
There are many other points of view in which  
they may be snbjects / f useful investigation,  
  
As an expedient for fixing your attention,  
make it ulso a practice for some time to minute  
down in writing your reflections upon what you  
read from day to day: you may perhaps at first  
find this irksome, and your reflections scanty  
and unimportant, but they will soon become both |  
easy and copious. Be careful of all not to let  
your reading make you a pedaot, or a bigot: let  
it never puff you up with pride, or a conceited  
opinion of your own knowledge, or make you  
intolerant of the opinions which others draw  
from the same source, however different from  
your own. And may the merciful Creator who  
gave the Scriptures for our instruction, bless  
your study of them, and make them to you  
“fruitful of good works !&quot;’

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
The style of none of the books, either in the  
  
reek and Roman schools, and the example of  
  
adopted in modern literature, that the Scriptures  
—differing so essentially from them—could not  
be imitated without great affectatiun: but for  
pathos of narrative; for the selections of inci-  
dents that go directly to the heart ; for the pic-  
turesque of character and manner ; the selection  
of circumstances that mark the individuality of  
persons ; fur copiousness, grandeur and sublim-  
ity of imagery; for unanswerable cogency and  
closeness of reasoning ; and for irresistible force  
of persuasion, no book in the world deserves to  
be so unceasingly studied, and so profoundly  
meditated upon as the Bible.  
  
I shall conclude here the series of letters,  
which I proposed about two years ago to write  
you for the purpose of exhorting you to search  
the Scriptures, and of pointing out to your con-  
sideration the general points of application; with  
a view to which, I thought this stady might be  
made profitable to the improvement and useful-  
ness of your future life. There are ether and  
particular points to which I may hereafter occa-  
sionally invite your attention, I am sensible  
how feeble and superficial what I haye written  
has been, and every letter has convinced me  
more and more of my own incompetency to the  
adequate performance of the task I had assumed;  
but my great object was to show you the impor-  
tance of devoting your own faculties to this pur-  
suit: to read the Bible, is of itself a laudable  
occupation and can scarcley fail of being a use-  
ful employment of time; but the habit of reflect-  
ing upon what you have read is equally essen-  
tial as that of reading itself, to give it all the ef-  
ficacy of which it is susceptible. I therefore  
recommend to you, to set apart a small portion  
of every day to read one or more chapters in the  
Bible, and always read it with reference to  
some particular train of observation or reflection.  
In these letters I have suggested to you four  
general ones. Considering the Semptures as  
Divine Revelations ; as historical records; as a  
system of morals ; and as literary compositions.  
There are many other points of view in which  
they may be snbjects of useful investigation.  
  
As an expedient for fixing your attention,  
make it also a practice for some time to minute  
down in writing your reflections upon what you  
read from day to day: you may perhaps at first  
find this irksome, and your reflections scanty  
and unimportant, but they wi!l soon become both  
easy and copious. Be careful of all not to let  
your reading make you a pedant, or a bigot: let  
it never puff you up with pride, or a conceited  
Opinion of your own knowledge, or make you  
intolerant of the opinions which others draw  
from the same source, however different from  
yourown. And may the merciful Creator who  
gave the Scriptures for our instruction, bless  
your study of them, and make them to you  
‘fruitful of good works !”’  
  
From your affectionate Father,  
  
  
  
Covenant, and was read aloud once in seven  
years, to all the people at their general assem-  
  
bly, in the Feast of Tabernacles; there was one  
  
other copy of the law, written upon stone, erect-  
  
ed on Nount Ebal. It does not appear that there  
  
existed any other copies. In process of time  
  
the usage of reading it thus must have been  
  
diopped, and the monument upon Mount Ebal  
  
must have perished ; for in the reign of Josiah,  
  
about 800 years afterward, the book of the law  
  
was found in the temple. How long it had  
  
been lost is not expressly to&#x27;d ; but from the as-  
  
tonishment and consternation of Josiah upon  
  
hearing the book read, its contents must have  
  
long been forgotten, so that scarcely a tradition  
  
of them remained. We are indeed told that  
when the Ark of the Covenant was deposited in  
  
the Temple of Solomon, there was nothing in  
  
the ark save the two tables which Moses put  
  
therein at Horeb. The two tables contained not  
the whole law, but the ten commandments: the  
  
bouk of the law was therefore no longer in the  
  
Ark, at the dedication of Solomon’s Temple ;  
  
that is,about 500 years after the jaw was given,  
  
and 300 before the book was found by Hezekiah  
  
high priest in the 19th year of Josiah. From  
  
these circumstances, as well as from the expe-  
dients used by Moses and Joshua, for preserving  
the ceremonial law and the repeated covenant  
between God and the people, it is observed that  
the art and practice of writing was extremely  
rare, and that very few of the people were even  
taught to read; tnat there were few books ex-  
tant, and of those few, only single copies ; the  
art of writing, speaking and thinking with their  
several modifications of grammar, rhetoric and  
logic, were never cultivated among the Hebrews  
as they were (though not till a thousand years  
later than Moses) among the Greeks. Philo-  
sophical research, and the spirit of analysis ap-  
peared to have belonged among the ancient na-  
tions exclusively to the Greeks; they studied  
language as a science, and from the discoveries  
they made in this pursuit, resulted a system of  
literary compositions founded upon logical de-  
ductions. The language of the ancient writers  
was not constructed upon the fuandation of ab-  
strnse science ; it partakes of the nature of all  
primitive languages, which is almost entirely  
figurative ; and in some degree of the character  
of primitive writing and hieroglyphics.  
  
We are not told fiom what materials Moses  
compiled the Book of Genesis, (which contains  
the history of the creation, and of 300 years  
succeeding it, which terminates three genera-  
tions prior to the birth of Moses himself;) wheth-  
er he had it altogether from tradition, or wheth-  
er he collected it from the more ancient written  
or printed memorials. The account of the crea-  
tion, of the fall of man, and all the antediluvian  
part of the history, carries strong internal evi-  
dences of having been copied or (if I may ex-  
press myself) translated from hieroglyphic or  
symbolical record ; the story is of the most per-  
fect simplicity, the discourses of the persons in-  
troduced are given as if taken down verbatim  
from their mouths, and the narrative is scarcely  
anything more than the connecting link of the  
discourses; the genealogies are given wijh great  
  
recision ; and this is one of the most remarka-  
Bie peculiarities of the Old Testament ; the rest  
is all figurative ; the Rib, the Garden, the Tree  
of Life and the Knowledge of Good and Evil,  
the Apple, the Serpent are all images which  
seem to indicate a hieroglyphic origin. Al the  
historical books, both of the Old and New Testa-  
ments, retain the peculiar characteristics that I  
havenoticed ; the simplicity and brevity of the  
narrative, the practice of repeating all discourses  
in the identical words spoken, and the constant  
use of figurative, symbolical and allegorical lan-  
guage. But of the rules of composition, pre-  
scribed by the Grecian schools, the unities’of  
Aristotle, or the congruities of figures taught by  
the Greek philologisis, not a feature is to be  
seen, The Psalms are a collection of songs ;  
the Song of Solomon isa pastoral Poem ; the  
Proverbs are a collection of moral sentences and  
maxims apparently addressed by Solomon’ to his  
son, with the addition of others of the same de-  
scription ; the Prophetical books are partly his-  
torical and partly poetical—they contain the nar-  
rative of visions and revelations of the Deity to  
the Prophets who recorded them. In the New  
Testament, the four Gospels and the Acts of  
the Apostles are historical,—they contain me-  
moirs of the life of Christ and some of His apos-  
tles, and the proceedings of some of His apos-  
tles, for some years after His decease. The  
simplicity of the narrative is the same as that of  
the Old Testament; the style in general indi-  
cates an age when reading and writing had be-  
come more common, and books more multiplied-  
The Epistles of Paul are the productions of a  
mind educated in the learning of the age, and  
well versed in the Grecian literature ; from his  
history it appears that he was not only capable  
of maintaining an argument with the Doctors of  
the Jewish law, bat of diseussing principles with  
the Stoic and Epicurean philosophers; his speech  
at Athens is a specimen of eloqaence worthy of  
an audience in the native country of Demosthe-  
nes. The Apocalypse of John resembles in  
many respects some of the prophetica] books of
