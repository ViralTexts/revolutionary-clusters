When this happens the Friends of Liberty, should any such remain will have one option still left, and will rather chuse no doubt to die the last British freemen, than bear to live the first of British Slaves, and this now seems to be all that is left to americans with unfeigned and penitant suplications to that Being who delights in the welfare of his creatures, and who we humbly hope will engage on our side, and who if we must go forth in defence of our injured and oppressed Country will we hope deliver us from the hands of our enimies and those that persecute us. Tho an hoste should encamp against us our hearts will not fear. Tho war should rise against us, in this will we be confident, that the Lord reigneth. Let thy Mercy o Lord be upon us according as we hope in thee.

Let these truths says the admired Farmer be indelibly impressed on our Minds that we cannot be happy without being free, that we cannot be free without being secure in our property, that we cannot be secure in our property if without our consent others may as by right take it away.—We know too well the blessings of freedom,

When Virtue sinks beneath unnumberd Woes  
And passions born her Friends, revoult her foes  
Tis Satire’s power tis her corrective part  
To calm the wild disorders of the heart  
She points the arduous height where glory lies  
And teaches mad ambition to be wise  
In the Dark Bosome wakes the fair desire  
Draws good from Ill, a Brighter flame from fire  
Strips black oppression of her gay disguise  
And bids the hag, in native horrour rise  
Strikes tow’ring pride and Lawless rapine Dead  
And plants the Wreath on Virtues awful head.”
