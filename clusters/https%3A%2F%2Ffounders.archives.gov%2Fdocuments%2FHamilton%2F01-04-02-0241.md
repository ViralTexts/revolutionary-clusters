First. As to the mode of appointing the judges: This is the same with that of appointing the officers of the union in general, and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers, that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition.

According to the plan of the convention, all the judges who may be appointed by the United States are to hold their offices during good behaviour, which is conformable to the most approved of the state constitutions; and among the rest, to that of this state. Its propriety having been drawn into question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light symptom of the rage for objection which disorders their imaginations and judgments. The standard of good behaviour for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government. In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince: In a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any government, to secure a steady, upright and impartial administration of the laws.  
Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive, that in a government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary on the contrary has no influence over either the sword or the purse, no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.  
This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves incontestibly that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power;  
  
The celebrated Montesquieu speaking of them says, “of the three powers above mentioned, the Judiciary is next to nothing.” Spirit of Laws, vol. I, page 186.  
  
that it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean, so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislative and executive. For I agree that “there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.”  
  
Idem. page 181.  
  
And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of such an union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed or influenced by its coordinate branches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence, as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution; and in a great measure as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.  
The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such for instance as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex post facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of the courts of justice; whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.  
Some perplexity respecting the right of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void, because contrary to the constitution, has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void. As this doctrine is of great importance in all the American constitutions, a brief discussion of the grounds on which it rests cannot be unacceptable.  
There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act therefore contrary to the constitution can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers do not authorise, but what they forbid.  
If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is not to be collected from any particular provision in the constitution. It is not otherwise to be supposed that the constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents. It is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is in fact, and must be, regarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcileable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought of course to be preferred; or in other words, the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.  
Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people declared in the constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter, rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental.  
This exercise of judicial discretion in determining between two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not uncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation: So far as they can by any fair construction be reconciled to each other; reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done: Where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect to one, in exclusion of the other. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is that the last in order of time shall be preferred to the first. But this is mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the law. They thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts of an equal authority, that which was the last indication of its will, should have the preference.  
But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be prefered to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority; and that, accordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter, and disregard the former.  
It can be of no weight to say, that the courts on the pretence of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it proved any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body.  
If then the courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited constitution against legislative encroachments, this consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent tenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as this to that independent spirit in the judges, which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty.  
This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency in the mean time to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community. Though I trust the friends of the proposed constitution will never concur with its enemies  
  
Vide Protest of the minority of the convention of Pennsylvania, Martin’s speech, &amp;c.  
  
in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government, which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established constitution whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness; yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents incompatible with the provisions in the existing constitution, would on that account be justifiable in a violation of those provisions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body. Until the people have by some solemn and authoritative act annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge of their sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act. But it is easy to see that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the constitution, where legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community.  
But it is not with a view to infractions of the constitution only that the independence of the judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of occasional ill humours in the society. These sometimes extend no farther than to the injury of the private rights of particular classes of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity, and confining the operation of such laws. It not only serves to moderate the immediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing them; who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of an iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled by the very motives of the injustice they meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a circumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our governments, than but few may be aware of. The benefits of the integrity and moderation of the judiciary have already been felt in more states than one; and though they may have displeased those whose sinister expectations they may have disappointed, they must have commanded the esteem and applause of all the virtuous and disinterested. Considerate men of every description ought to prize whatever will tend to beget or fortify that temper in the courts; as no man can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a gainer to-day. And every man must now feel that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of public and private confidence, and to introduce in its stead, universal distrust and distress.  
That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the constitution and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission. Periodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would in some way or other be fatal to their necessary independence. If the power of making them was committed either to the executive or legislature, there would be danger of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if to both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either; if to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the special purpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity, to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the constitution and the laws.  
There is yet a further and a weighty reason for the permanency of the judicial offices; which is deducible from the nature of the qualifications they require. It has been frequently remarked with great propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one of the inconveniences necessarily connected with the advantages of a free government. To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind, that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. Hence it is that there can be but few men in the society, who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges. And making the proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of human nature, the number must be still smaller of those who unite the requisite integrity with the requisite knowledge. These considerations apprise us, that the government can have no great option between fit characters; and that a temporary duration in office, which would naturally discourage such characters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to accept a seat on the bench, would have a tendency to throw the administration of justice into hands less able, and less well qualified to conduct it with utility and dignity. In the present circumstances of this country, and in those in which it is likely to be for a long time to come, the disadvantages on this score would be greater than they may at first sight appear; but it must be confessed that they are far inferior to those which present themselves under the other aspects of the subject.  
Upon the whole there can be no room to doubt that the convention acted wisely in copying from the models of those constitutions which have established good behaviour as the tenure of their judicial offices in point of duration; and that so far from being blameable on this account, their plan would have been inexcuseably defective if it had wanted this important feature of good government. The experience of Great Britain affords an illustrious comment on the excellence of the institution.

the medium of the courts of juſtice; whoſe duty it muſt be to declare  
all acts contrary to the manifeſt tenor of the conſtitution void.  
Without this, all the reſervations of particular rights or privileges  
would amount to nothing.  
  
Same perplexity reſpecling the rightof the courts to pronounce  
leg iſſative acts void, becauie contrary to the conſtitution, has ariſen  
from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a ſuperiority of  
the judiciary to the legiſlative power. It is urged that the authority  
which can declare the acts of another void, muſt neceſſarily be ſupe-  
rior to the one whoſe acts may be declared void. As this doctrine  
is of great importance in all the American conſtitutions, a brief diſ-  
cuſſion of the grounds on which it reſts cannot be unacceptable.  
  
+ There is no poſition which depends on clearer principles, than  
that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the  
commiſſion under which it is exerciſed, is void. No legiſlative act,  
therefore, contrary to the conſtitution, can be valid. To deny this,  
would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than nis principal; that  
the ſervant is above his matter ; that the repreſentatives of the peo-  
e are ſuperior to the people themſelves ; that men acting by virtue  
of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authoriſe, but  
waat they forbid. |  
  
If it be ſaid that the legiſlative body are themſelves the conſti-  
tutional judges of their own powers, and that the conſtruction they  
put upon them is conciufive upon the other departments, it may be  
aniwered, that this cannot be the natural preſumption, vhere it is not  
to be collected from any particular proviſions in the conſtitution.  
it is not otherwiſe to be ſuppoſed that the conſtitution could intend  
o chable the repreſentatives of the people to ſabltitute their vii to  
cat of their contiituents. It is far more rational to ſuppoſe, that  
tlie courts were deſigned to be an intermediate body between the  
people and the legiſlature, in order, among other things, to keep -  
the latter within the limits afagned to their authority. The inter-  
pretation cf the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the  
courts. A coniticution is in fact, and muit be, regarded by the  
judges as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to aſ-  
certain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act  
proceeding from tne legiflative body. If there ſhould happen to be  
au irre ron cilable variance between the two, that which has the ſu-  
perior  
  
C99}  
  
petior obligation and validity, ought of courſe to be preferred; or,  
in other words, the conſitution ought to be preferred to the ſta-  
tute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.  
Nor does this coneluſion by any means ſuppoſe a ſuperiority of  
the judicial to the legiſlative power, It only ſuppoſes that the  
power of the people is ſuperior to both; and that where the will of  
the legiſlature declared in its ſtatutes, ſtands in oppoſition to that of  
the people declared in the conſtitution, the judges ought to be go-  
verned by the latter, rather than the former. They ought to regu-  
late their deciſions by the fundamental laws, rather than by thoſe  
which are not fundamental.  
  
This exerciſe of judicial diſcretion in determining between  
two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar inſtance, It  
not uncommonly happens, that there are two ſtatutes exiſting at  
one time, claſhing in whole or in part with each other, and neither  
of them containing any repealing clauſe or expreſſion. In ſuch a

legiſlative authority; ſuch, for inſtance, as that it ſhall paſs no  
biils of attajinder,&#x27; no ex pot facto laws, and the like. Limitations  
ot titis kind can be preſerved in practice no other way than through  
the medium of the courts of juitice ; whoſe duty it muſt be to declare  
all acts contrary to the manifeſt tenor of the conſtitution void.  
Without this, all the reſervations of particular rights or privileges  
would amount to nothing. 8 |  
  
«« Some perplexity reſpecling the rightof the courts to pronounce  
lJegitlanve acts void, becauie contrary to the conſtitution, has ariſen  
from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a ſuperiority of  
the judiciary to the legiſlative power. It is urged that the authority  
which can declare the acts of another void, muſt neceffarily be ſupe-  
  
  
is of great importance in all the American conſtitutions, a brief diſ-  
cuſſion of the grounds on which it reſts cannot be unacceptable. &#x27;  
  
* There is no poſition which depends on clearer principles, than  
that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the  
commiſhon under which it is exerciſed, is void. No legiſlative act,  
therefore, contrary to the conſtitution, can be valid. To deny this,  
would be to aifirm that the deputy is greater than nis principal; that  
the ſervant is above his matter ; that the repreſcatatives of the peo-  
ple are ſaperior to the people themſelves ; that men acting by virtue  
of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authoriſe, but  
what they forbid. |  
  
If it be ſaid that the legiſlative body are themſelves the conſti-  
tutional judges of their own powers, and that the conſtruction they  
put upon them is concluſive upon the other departments, it may be  
anſwered, that this cannot be the natural preſumption, v.here it is not  
to be collected from any particular proviſions in the conſtitution.  
It is not otherwiſe to be ſuppoſed that the conſtitution could intend  
to enable the repreſentatives of the people to ſabſtitute their avid to  
that of their conſtituents. It is far more rational to ſuppoſe, that  
the courts were deſigned to be an intermediate body between the  
  
  
the latterw ithin the limits afiigned to meir authority. The inter-  
pretation cf the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the  
courts. A coniticution is in fact, and mult be, regarded by the  
judges as a fundamental la. It therefore belongs to them to aſ-  
certain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act  
proceeding from tne legiflative body. If there ſhould happen to be  
an 1rr2:01.ciable variance between the two, that which has the ſu-

in other words, the conſtitution ought to be preferred to the ſta-  
tute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.  
  
Nor does this coneluſion by any means ſuppoſe a ſuperiority of  
the judicial to the legiſlative power. It only ſuppoſes that the  
rower of the people is ſuperior to both ; and that where the will of  
the legiſlature declared in its ſtatutes, ſtands in oppolition to that of  
the people declared in the conſtitution, the judges ought to be go-  
verned by the latter, rather than the former. They ought to regu-  
late their deciſions by the fundamental laws, rather than by thoſe  
which are not fundamental. | | |  
This exerciſe of judicial diſcretion in determining between  
two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar inſtance. It  
not uncommonly happens, that there are two ſtatutes exiſting at  
one time, claſhing in whole or in part with each other, and neither  
of them containing any repealing clauſe or expreſſion. In ſuch a  
| caſe, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their mean-  
ing and operation; ſo far as they can by any fair conſtruction be  
” reconciled to each other; reaſon and law conſpire to diate that  
* this ſhould be done: Where this is impracticable, it becomes a  
| matter of neceſſity to give effect to one, in excluſion of the other.  
The rule which bas obtained in the courts for determining their  
relative validity is that the laſt in order of time, ſhall be preferred  
to the firſt, But this is a mere rule of conſttuction, not derived  
from any poſitive law, but from the nature and reaſon of the thing.  
It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legiſlative proviſion,  
but acopted by themſelves, as conſonant to truth and propriety, for  
  
  
thought it reaſonable, that between the interfering acts of an equal  
authority, that which was the laſt indication of its will, ſhould have  
the preference. 77 *  
  
„ But in regard to the interfering acts of a ſuperior and ſubordi-  
nate authority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and  
reaſon of the thing indicate the converſe of that rule as proper to be  
followed. They teach us that the prior act of a ſuperior ought to be

thority; aud that, accordingly, whenever a particular ſtatute con-  
travenes the conſtitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals  
to adhere to the latter, and diſregard the former.  
  
It can be of no weight to ſay, that the courts on the pretence

the cafe of two contradictory ſtatutes; or it might as well happen

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
According to the plan of the convention, all the  
judges who may be appointed by the United States  
are to hold their offices dui mg good be/uuiuur ;  
which is comm mable to the most approved of the  
state constitutions—among the rest, to that of this  
slale(N. York.) Its propriety having b-cndrawn into  
question by the adversaries of that plan, is no light  
symptom of the rage for objection, which disorders  
their imaginations and judgments. The standard  
of good behaviour for the continuance in office of  
the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most  
valuable of the modern improvements in the prac­  
tice of government. In a monarchy, it is an ex­  
cellent harrier to the despotism of the piince; in a  
republick, it is a no less excellent barrier to the en­  
croachments and oppressions of the representative  
body. And it is the best expedient which, can  
be devised in any government, to secure a stea­  
dy, upright, and impartial administration of the  
laws.  
Whoever attentively considers the different de­  
pat tinents of power must perceive, that in a go­  
vernment in which they are separated from each  
other, the judiciary, from the nature ol its functions,  
  
win always tic me least dangerous to me political  
rights of the constitution ; because it will be the  
least in a capacity to annoy or injure, them. The  
executive not only dispenses the honours, but holds  
the sword of the community : The legislature not  
only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules  
by which the duties and rights of every citizen are  
to be regulated : The judiciary, on the contrary, has  
influence over either the sword or the puise; no  
no direction either of the strength or of the wealth  
of the society ; and can take no active resolution  
whatever. It may truly be said to have neither  
force nor will, but merely judgment; and must  
ultimately depeud upon the aid of the execu­  
tive arm for the efficacious exercise even of this  
faculty.  
This simple view of the matter suggests several  
important consequences : it proves incontestibly,  
that the judiciary is, beyond comparison, the weak­  
est of tin; three departments ol power ;* that it can  
never attack with success either ol the other two ;  
and that all possible rare is requisite to enable it  
to detend itself against their attacks. It equally  
proves, that though individual oppression may now  
and then proceed liom the courts ot justice, the ge­  
neral liberty of llie people can never be eiidangeieu  
from that quarter : I mean so long as the judiciary  
remains truly distinct from both the legislature) and  
executive. For I agree, that “ there is no liberty,  
“ if the power of judging be not separated Irom the  
“ legislative, and executive powers.”f It proves, in  
the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to  
fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every  
thing to fear Irom its uuion with either of the other  
departments; that as all the effects of such an uni­  
on must ensue iiom a dependence, ot the former on  
the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent  
separation ; that as, from the natural feebleness of  
the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being  
overpowered, awed or infiutnred by its co-ordinate  
branches ; that, as uoihing can contribute so much  
to ilstirruness and indeptiuu-nie as permanency&#x27; in  
office, this quality may therefore be justly regard­  
ed as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution ;l  
and, m a .great measure, as Lire citadeloI the pub- i  
  
lick justice and tlie puolick security.  
The complete independent e ol&#x27; the courts of jus­  
tice is peculiarly essential in alnnittcd constitution.  
Lly a limitted constitution, i understand one winch  
contains certain spccilied exceptions to the legisla- i  
live autiionty ; such, for instance, as that it shall!  
pass no bills of attainder, no tx jmt facto laws, and  
live like. Limitations ol tins kind cau he preserv- j  
rd in practice no other way than through the me- 1  
diuui of the courts of justice; whose duty it must  
be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor;  
of the constitution void. Without this, all the re­  
servations oi particular rights oi privileges would a­  
mount to nothing.  
Soom* perplexity respecting the rightof the courts  
to pronounce legislative acts void, because contrary !  
to the constitution, has aiiseu from an imagination :  
that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the  
judiciary to the legislative power. It is prged that  
the authority winch can declare the acts of another i  
void, must necessarily be stiperiour to the one whose  
acts may be declared void. As this doetrine is of  
great importance in all the. American constitutions,  
a brief discussion of lire grouuds on which it rests  
cannot be unacceptable.  
There is no position which depends on clearer  
principles, than that of every act of a delegated au­  
thority, contrary to the tenor of the commission  
under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative  
act, therefore, contrary to tire ennstitulion,-can be  
valid. To deny this, would be to athrm, that the de­  
puty is greater thau his principal; that the servant is  
greater tliau his master ; that the representatives of  
the people are superior to the people themselves ; that  
men, acting by virtue of poweis, may do not only  
what their powers do not authorise, but what they  
forbid.  
If it he said that the legislative body are them­  
selves the constitutional judges of their own powers,  
and that the construction they put upon them is  
conclusive upojj the other departments, it may he  
answered, that this cannot be the natural presump­  
tion, where it is not to be collected from any par­  
ticular provisions in the constitution. It is not o­  
therwise to be supposed, that the constitution could  
intend to enable the representatives of Abe people to  
substitute their wilt to that of their constituents. It

is far more rational to suppose, that the courts were  
designed to he an intermediate body between the  
people and the legislature, in order, among other  
things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned  
to their authority. The interpretation of the laws  
is the proper and peculiar province of the courts.  
A constitution is, in fact, and must be, regarded by  
the judges as a fundamental law. It must therefore  
belong to them to ascertain its meaning, as  
well as the meaning of any particular aft pro­  
ceeding from the legislative body. If &#x27;there  
should happen to be an irreconcileahle vari­  
ance between the two, that which h;i3 the superior  
| uoligation and validity ought of course, to he pre­  
ferred ; in other words, the constitution ought to  
j be preferred to the statute, the intention of the peo­  
ple to the intentioirof their agents.  
Nor does the conclusion by anv means suppose a  
superiority of the judicial to the legislative power.  
It only supposes lli.it the power of the people is su­  
perior to both ; and that where the will of the legis­  
lature declared in its statutes, stands in opposition  
to that of tiie people declared in the constitution,  
the judges ought to he governed by the latter, rather  
than the former. They ought to regulate their de­  
cisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by  
  
rviuui me mu luiiuameniiii. &#x27;  
&#x27;I his exercise ol judicial discretion in determining  
between two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a  
familiar instance. It not uncommonly happens,  
that there are two statutes existing at one time,  
clashing in whole or in part with each other, and  
neither ot them containing any repealing clause or  
expression. In such a rase, it is the province of  
the courts to liquidate arid lix their mraningand ope­  
ration : So fares they can by any fair construction  
be reconciled fo each other ; reason andlawconspire  
to dictat&quot; that this shoold be done : Where this is  
impracticable, it becomes nr matter of necessity to  
give fifed to one, in exclusion of the other. The  
tule which has obtained in the courts for determin­  
ing their relative validity is that the last in order of  
time shall be preferred to the first. But this is  
mere rule of construction not derived from any posi­  
tive law, blit from the nature and reason of the  
thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by  
legislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as  
consonant to truth and propriety, for the direction  
ol their conduct as interpreters of the law. They  
thought it reasonable, that between the interfering  
acts of an equal authority, that which was the last  
indication ot its will, should have the preference.  
But in reguidito the interfering acts of a saperi­  
orand subordinate authority, of an original and deri­  
vative power, the nature and reason of the tiling in­  
dicate the converse ol that rule as proper to be fol­  
lowed. They teach tls that the prior act of a supe­  
rior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of  
an interior anil subordinate authority; and lhat,ac­  
j cordtngiy, whenever a particular statute contravenes  
the constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial  
tribunals to adhere to the latter, and disregard the  
former.  
It ran be of no weight to say, that the courts on  
the pretence of a repugnancy, may substitute their  
own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the  
legislature. This might as well happen in the case  
ol two contradictory statutes; or it might as well  
happen in every adjudication upon any single sta­  
tute. The courts must declare the sense ot the law ;  
and if ttiey should be disposed to exercise will in  
stead of judgment, the consequence would equally  
be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the  
  
n*$» &amp;i«iiivt iiiiujf« i iic uobtri vuui/n, ii it pi uvea any  
thing, would prove that there ought tube no judges  
distinct from that body.  
If then the courts of justice are t&lt;V be considered  
as the bulwarks of a Imbued constitution against  
legislative encroachments, this consideration will  
ahord a strung argument for the pennancnl tenure,  
of judicial othces, since nothing will contribute so,  
much as this to that independent spirit in the judges,;  
which must he essential to the faithful performance 1  
of so arduous a duty.  
This independence of the judges is equally requi­  
site to guard the ronsitution and the rights of indivi­  
duals from the effects of those ill humours which the  
arts ol designing men, or the influence of particular  
conjectures sometimes disseminate among the peo­  
ple themselves, and whirl), though they speedily  
give place to better information and more deliberate  
reflection, have a tendency in themeau time to oc­  
casion dangerous innovations in the government,  
and serious oppressions of the minor party iu the  
community. Though 1 trust the friends of the pro­  
posed constitution1 will never concur with its ene­  
mies* in questioning that fundamental principle of  
republican government, which admits the right of  
the people to alter or abolish the established con  
slitnlion whenever they find it inconsistent with  
their happiness ; yet it is not to be inferred from  
this principle, that the representatives of the people,  
whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay  
| hold of a majority oi their constituents incompatible  
with the provisions in the existing constitution,  
would on that account he justifiable iu a violation of  
those provisions ; or that the courts would be un­  
der a greater obligation to connive at infractions in  
this shape, than when they had proceeded wholly  
nom the cabals of the representative body. Until  
the people have by some solefnn and authoritative  
act annulled or changed the established form, it is  
binding upon themselves collectively, as well as in­  
dividually ; and no presumption, or even knowledge  
of their sentiments, ran warrant their representa­  
tives in a departure from it, prior to such an act.—  
But it m easy to see that it would require an uncom­  
mon portion of fortitude in the judges to dt&gt; then­  
duty as faithful guardians of the constitution, where  
legislative invasions pf it had been instigated by the  
major voice of the community. . &lt;

Bnt it is not with a view to infractions of the eon—  
stitution only that the independence of the judges&#x27;  
may he an essential safeguard against the effects of  
occasional ill, hum..urs in the society. These some­  
times extend no faither than’to the injury of the­  
private rights of particular classes citizens, by  
unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of  
the judicial magistracy is of vast importance m mi­  
tigating the severity, and confining the operation ,of  
such laws. It’not only serves to moderate the ltn- *  
mediate mischiefs of those which may have beet*  
passed, but it operates as a check upon the legisla- „  
tive body in&gt; passing them ; wbor perceiving that,  
obstacles to the success, of an iniquitous inlentipie  
are to’be expected from the scruples of the courts,  
Ure m-&#x27;a Manner’compelled by the very&#x27; motives oF  
the injustice they meditate, to qualify their attempts.  
&#x27;I his is a circumstance calculated to have more in­  
fluence iipon the character o! our governments*  
than Out i’ew may be aware of. The benefits of the  
integrity and moderation of the judiciary have alrea­  
dy been felt in more states than one ; and though  
they, may have disappointed, they must have com­  
manded the esteem and applause of all the virtuoys.  
and disinterested.. Considerate men of every de­  
  
pi i union ougm 10 pnze wnaiever win tend to begft  
or fortify that temper-in the courts ; as uotnan cft».  
be sure that he may not tie to-morrow the victim ef  
a spirit of injustice, by which be may be a gainer  
to-day. And every man must now feel that the ine— f  
I vitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foun­  
dations of public and private confidence, and to ih­  
I troduce in its stead, universal distrust and distress. »  
j That inflexibleand uniform adherence to thevigty#  
of the constitution and of individuals, which we per­  
ceive to be indispensable in the couits of justice, cam  
certainly not be expected from judges who bold  
their offices by a temporary commission. Periodi­  
cal appointments, however regulated, or by whom­  
soever made, would in some way or other be fatal  
to their necessary independence. If the power of  
making them was committed either to the execu­  
tive or legislative, there would he danger of an id­  
proper complaisance to the branch which pnssessol  
it ; il to both, there would be an unwillingness toi  
hazard the displeasure of either ; if to the people, qr  
to persons chosen by them for the special purpose*  
there would be too great a disposition to consult po­  
pularity, to justily a reliance that nothing would  
he consulted hut the constitution and the laws.  
1 here is yet a further aud a weighty reason fo^  
the permanency of the judicial officers ; which is de­  
dueible from the nature of the qualifications they re­  
quire. It has been frequently remarked with great  
propriety, that a voluminous code of laws is one qf  
the inconvcnicncies necessarily connected with tl\a  
advantages of a free government. To avoid an ar­  
bitrary discretion in the courts-, it is indispensable  
that they should be bound down by strict rules and  
precedents, which serve to define and point out theij­  
duty in every particular case thatcomes before Ml?til;  
and it will readily be conceived from the variety of  
controversies which grow out of the folly and wick­  
edness of mankind, that the records of those prece­  
dents must unavoidably swell to a very considera­  
ble bulk, and must demand long and laborious study  
to acquire a competent knowledge of them. Iienro  
it is that there can be but few men in the society*  
who will buve sufficient skill in the laws to qualify  
.them for the stations of judges. And making the  
proper deductions for the ordinary depravity of hu­  
man nature, the number must be still smaller of those  
who unite the requisite integrity with the requisites  
knowledge.. These considerations apprise us, that  
the government can have no great option between  
fit characters ; and that a temporary duration in of­  
fice, which would naturally discourage such charac­  
ters from quitting a lucrative line of practice to ac­  
cept a seat on the bench, would have a tendency to  
throw the administration of justice into hands less 4- y  
ble and less well qualified to conduct it with utility  
anddignity. In the present circumstances of this  
country, and in those in which it is likely to  
be for a long time to come, the disadvantages oa  
this score would be greater than they may ut first  
sight appear ; hut il must be confessed that they  
are far inferior to tliose.vvhich present themselves  
under the other aspects of the subject.  
Upon the whole, there can be no room to doubf*  
that the convention acted wisely in copying from  
the models of those constitutions which have esta­  
blished/fooJ behaviour as the tenure of judicial office^*  
in point of duration; and that, so far from being  
blameable on this account, their plan would have  
been inexcusably defective, if it bad wanted this im­  
portant feature qf good government. The experi­  
ence of Great Britain affords an illustrious comment  
on the excellence of the institution. - -

cludes that ‘‘the complete independence of the courts of justice  
is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution ;”’ and further,  
that the limitations of the Constitution, ‘‘ the specified exceptions  
to the legislative authority, can be preserved in practice no other-  
wise than through the medium of the courts of justice ; whose  
duty it must be to declare all Acts, contrary to the manifest tenor  
of the Constitution, void. Without this, all the reservations of  
particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.’’ The  
whole question is then argued with a strong and skilful hand ;  
and the wonder is that it should ever afterwards be moved. It  
is shown that the doctrine implies no superiority of the judiciary  
to the legislative power; but a submission of both to the will of  
the people who are the masters of both. ‘Where the will of  
the /egis/ature declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to  
that of the people declared in the Constitution, the Judges ought  
to be governed by the latter, rather than the former.”  
  
When the Constitution was submitted to the people for their  
consideration, and Conventions were appointed for this purpose,  
in the several states; it was impossible that this power of the ju-  
diciary should have escaped attention. A reference to such of  
the debates of the Conventions as have been published, will show  
what was thought of it by the great men of which those bodies  
were composed,

upon the umpirage of the Supreme Court, as  
one of the principal benefits of tho new system  
It is their precise language that the -limitations  
upon the legislative authority, whether of Con  
gress or the States, can be preserved in no other  
way iban through the medium of the supreme  
tribunal &quot; whose duty it is to declare all acts  
contrary to the constitution void.&quot; &quot;A consti  
tution,&quot; says the book, &quot;is in fact, and must be  
regarded by the judges as a fundamental law.  
It must therefore, belong to them t9ascertain  
its meaning, as well as the meaning of any par  
ticular act proceeding from the legislative body:  
the constitution must be preferred to the statute;  
the intention of the people to the intention of  
their agents.

“Sowe perplexity exists in regard to the right  
of Courts of Justice to pronounce legislative acts  
void, on the ground of their unconsttutionality,  
from apprebension that the doetrine would estub­  
lish a ruperiority of the jndicial over the legisla­  
tive power. As the subject is of great practical  
importance, a rapid survey of the grounds on  
which 1t was defended by our most eminent  
statesmen cannol be disadvantageous; especiaily  
as it exhibits a contemporaneons: construction of’  
the highest anthority of that part of the Constitu­  
tion. “There is no position”, vay the illustrions  
unthors of the “ Federalist&#x27;&#x27;, “which depends on  
clearer prineiples, than that every nct of a dele­  
gnted anthorpty, contrary 1o the commission under  
which it 13 exercised, 18 void.&quot; No legislative  
act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, which  
is the commission, by which every departinent  
of the government equally derices its authority  
Sfrom the people, ean be valid, &quot;Co deny this, would  
be to affirm, that the deputy is superior to his  
principal; that the servant is above his master;  
that the Representatives of the prorLE are greater:  
than the vrovrg thomselees; and that persons act--  
ing in virtne of a delegated authority notonly:  
assume what their powers do not authorise, but  
what they expressly forbid. If it be alleged that  
legislative bodies nre themselveas the constitutional  
i_&#x27;|udgen of their own powers, and that their own  
“construction of them is canclusive upon the other  
departments, it may be answered, that this cannot  
be the natural presumption where it is not to be  
collected from the nataral provisions of the fun -  
damental compact. Without such express provi--  
sion, it is not to be intended that the Constitution:  
meant to enable the representatives of the people ro­  
substitute their own will, in the place of that of their­  
constituents : it is far more rational to conelude.,  
that the Courts of Justice were only intended to  
represent the sovereignty of the people, in a co­  
ordinate and independem department; and, i  
  
Hartford Courant.  
  
that capacity, to act as an intermediato body be--  
tween the people and the legislature, in order,  
among other things, to keep the latter within the  
limits assigned to its anthority.  
The interpretation of the laws is the proper  
and pecubar province of the Courts; and the  
  
Coustitution is, in fact, and must be regrrded by­  
them, as a fundamental law. Tt mast therefors  
belong to them to uscertain its meaning, as well  
us the meawmng of any partienlar act proceeding  
from the legislative body. [lf there should hap..  
pen to be anirreconcilable variance between the  
two, that which has the superior obligation onght,  
of courze to be preferred; in other words, the  
Constitntion ought to be preferred to the statnte ;  
the intention of the people to the intention of their  
agents. Nor does this conclusion, by any means,  
suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legis-  
Intive power. It only presnmes that the power of  
the people is superior to both ; and where the will  
of the legislatare, declared in the stawute book,  
stands opposed to the will of the people, declared  
in the Constitution, the Judges ought to be gov­  
erned by the latter rather than the former, and  
ought to regulate their, decisions by that funda­  
mental law, over which the legislature has mo  
control, rather than by those which it may at any  
Atime alter or repeal, and which derive their va­  
idity and effect from the Constitution alone, It  
icun be of no weight to say, that the Courts of  
Justice, under the pretence of a repugnancy be­  
“tween a law and the Constitution, may =abstitute  
‘lheir own pleasure in the staad of the constitu­  
tional intentions of the legislature, for this suppo­  
-2 sition not only involvesa petition of the question,  
but might as well happen, in the case of two con­  
tradictory statutes, or in every separate adjudica­  
.lion npon the same statute, The Courts are  
‘bonnd to declare the meaning of the law ; and il  
| they should be disposed to exercise wiLL instead  
Cof guvavesT, the consequence in the one case,  
‘ as well as the other, would be the substitntion of  
their own pleasnre in lien of the pleasure of the  
legislature.  
&#x27; The objection, therefore, if it proved anything,  
would prove that there should be no Judges dis­  
llinct from the legislative body. But, the danger  
of intrasting judicial and legislative powers in  
’llue same hands, has already been pointed ont:  
and I have shown, [ think, that the objeet of their  
separation was not only to create a distinet and  
independent body to expound the laws, but also  
1o erect a bulwurk to defend a constitution, lim­  
ited in its powers, against legislative encroach­

“In a monarchy it, (an independent judicia-

&quot;If the courts ef justice are to be considered M  
bul warts of a limited constitution, against legiffiatft /e en~  
croachn*ents, this sonsrderatisn will afford a strong:? argu­  
ment for the permamnt tenure of judicial offices, sinoe not king  
will contribute^ much as this-to that independent a| &#x27;***t  
in tbe judges which mast be essential to the faithful&#x27;} er~  
formance of bo arduous a duty.  
&quot; This independenoe of the judges is equally requtflfe  
to guard the Constitution and the rights of individual 3  
from the effects of those ill human which the arts of dfc­  
signing men,, or the inttuenee of particular oonjuncturwv  
sometimes disseminate among the people thea^elyes, and.  
which, though theyspeedily give place to better informa?  
tion and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, ixu  
the mean time, to occasion dangeroes innovations in the*  
Government, and serious oppressione-of the rainor party  
in the community. Though I.trust the friends-of the pro* *  
posed Constitution will never concur with its-enemies- im  
questioning that fundamental principle of republican Gov­  
ernment which admits the right of the people to alter or  
abolish the established Constitution whenever they find it  
inconsistent with their happiness, yet itis not to be in- &#x27;  
ferred from this principle that the representatives of the*  
people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay &lt;  
hold of a majority of their constituents incompatible withi j  
the provisions in the existing.constitution, would, on that }  
account, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions j  
or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to  
connive at infractions in this shape than when they had  
proceeded wholly from the cabals of-the representative j  
body. Until the people have, by some solemn and au- ?  
thoritative act, annulled or changed the established form,  
it u binding upon themselves collectively as well at individually  
and no presumption of&quot; even knowledge of their sentiments can  
warrant their representatives in a departure from it, prior to  
such an act. But it is easy to see that it would require  
an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their  
duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution,. where legis­  
lative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of  
the community.  
&quot; But it is not with a view to infractions of the Consti­  
tution only that the independenoe of the judges may be  
an essential safe-guard against the effects of occasional HI hu­  
mors in the society. These sometimes extend ho further  
than to the injury of the private right* of particular classes  
of citizens, by unjust and partial laws. Here also lb?  
firmness of the judicial magistracy is of vast importance  
in mitigating the severity and confining the operation ot  
such laws. It not only serve# to moderate the immediate  
mi-chiefs of thoo which may have been passed, but it  
operates as a check upon the legislative body in passing  
them ; who, perceiving that obstacles to the success of  
in iniquitous intention are to be expected from the scru­  
ples of the courts, are in a manner compelled, by the very  
notives of the injustice they meditate, to qualify their  
ittempts. This is a circumstance Calculated to have  
nore influence upon the character of our Governments  
,han but few may imagine. The benefits of the integrity  
ind moderation of the judioiary have already been felt in  
nore States than one; and, though they may have dis­  
pleased those whose sinister expectations they may have  
lisappointed, they must have commanded the esteem and  
ipplause of all the virtuous and disinterested. Considerate  
nen, of every description, ought to prite whatever will  
end to beget or fortify that temper in the courts j as no  
nan can be sure that he may not be to-morrow the victim  
&gt;f a spirit of injustice by which he may be a gainer to­  
lay. And every man must now feel that the inevitable  
endency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of pub­  
ic and private confidence, and to introduce in its stead  
iniversal distrust and distress.  
&lt;i That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights  
&gt;f the Constitution and of individuals which we perceive  
x&gt; be indispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly not  
&gt;e expected from judges who hold their offices by a tem­  
&gt;orary commission. Periodical appointments, however re­  
gulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or  
&gt;ther, be fatal to their necessary independence. If the power  
&gt;f making them was committed either to the Executive or  
Legislature, there would be danger of an improper com­  
&gt;laisance to the branch which possessed it; if to both,  
here would be an unwillingness to hatard the displeasure  
&gt;f either; if to the people, or to persons chosen by them  
&#x27;or the special purpose, there would be too great a duposi­  
ion to consult popularity to justify a reliance that nothing  
could be consulted but the Constitution and the laws.&quot;  
?? Upon the whole, there can be no room to doubt that  
he Convention acted wisely in copying from the models  
&gt;f those constitutions which have established good beha  
?iour as the tenure of judicial offices, in point of duration;  
ind that, so far from being blameable on this account,  
heir plan would have been inexcusably defective if il had  
ranted this important feature of good government.

fend and maintain the limitations of power de­  
clared by the fundamental law. He says Fed  
eralist Paper, LXNVIII): &quot;The complete inde  
pendence of the courts of justice is peculiarly  
ential in a limited constitution. By a limited  
constitution I understand one which contains  
certain specified exceptions to the lecislati  
a e    S ss as  
thority; such for instence as that it shall pass no  
bills of attainder, no expost facto law, and the  
like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in  
practice in no other way than through the medium  
of the courts of justice, whose duty it must be to  
declare all laws contrary to the manifest tenor of  
the Constitution void. Without this all the re  
servations of particular rights or privileges would  
amount to nothing.  
&quot;Some perplexity respecting the rights of  
courts to pronounce legislative acts void be  
cause contrary to the Constitution has arisen  
from an imagination that the doctrine would im-  
ply a superiority of the judiciary to the legi­  
lative power. It is urged that the authority  
which can declare the acts of another void must  
necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may  
be declared void. As this doctrine is of great  
importance in all the American Constitutions, a  
brief discussion of the grounds on which it rests  
cannot be unacceptable.  
&quot;There is no position which depends on clearer  
principles than that every act of delegated au­  
thority contrary to the tenor of the commission  
under which it is exercised, is void. No legisla­  
tive act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution,  
can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm  
that the deputy is greater than his principal; that  
the servant is above his master; that the repre  
sentatives of the people are superior to the peo­  
ple themselves; that men acting by virtue of  
powers may do not only what the powers do not  
authorize, but what they forbid. If it be said  
that the legislative body are themselves the Con  
stitutional judges of their own powers, and the  
construction they put on them is conclusive upon  
other departments, it may be answered that this  
cannot be the natural presumption, where it is to  
be collected from any particular provisions of the  
Constitution. It is not otherwise to be supposed  
that the Constitution could intend to enable the  
representatives of the people to substitute their  
will to that of their constithents. It is far more  
rational to suppose that the courts were designed  
a ttor edito tiule trata ot tho woenlo  
e  mtetate y teece te peobi  
and the legislature, in order, among other things.  
to keep the latter within the limits assigned to  
their authority. The interpretation of the law is  
the proper and peculiar province of the courts.  
A constitution is, in fact, and must be received  
by the judges, as a fun damental law. It must  
therefore belong to them to ascertain its mean-  
ing, as well as the meaning of any particular  
act proceeding from the legislative body. If  
there should happen to be an irreconcilable va-  
.  
riance between the two, that which has the supe-  
rior obligation and validity ought, of course, to  
be preferred; in other words, the Constitution  
ought to be preferred to the Statute; the inten  
tion of the people to the intention of their agents.  
Nor does the conclusion by any means suppose a  
superiority of the judicial to the legislative  
power. It only supposes that the power of the  
people is superior to both; and that where the  
will of the legislature declared in its statutes  
stands in opposition to that of the people de  
clared in the Constitutiom the judges ought to  
be governed by the latter rather than by the for  
mer. They ought to regulate their decisions by  
the fundamental laws, rather than by those which  
are not fundamental. It can be of no weight to  
ay that the Courts on a pretence of a repugnan  
nancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the  
constitutional intentions of the legislature.  
This might as well happen in the case of two  
contradictory statutes; or, it might as well hap­  
pen in every adjudication upon any single stat  
ute  
&quot;The independence of the judges is equally  
requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights  
of individuals from the effects of those ill humors  
which the acts of designing men or the in Juence  
of particular conjunctures sometimes disseminate  
among the people themselves, and which, though  
they speedily give place to better information  
and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency,  
in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innova  
tions in the Government, and serious oppressions  
of the minor party in the community. Though  
I trust the friends of the proposed constitution  
will never concur with its enemies in questioning  
that fundamental principle of republican govern­  
ment, which admits the right of the people to  
alter or abolish the established constitution when  
ever they find it inconsistent with their happiness;  
yet it is not to be inferred from this principle that  
the representatives of the people, whenever a  
momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a  
majority of their constituents, incompatible with  
the provisions of the existing constitution, would  
on that account be justified in the violation of  
those provisions; or that the courts would be  
under a greater obligation to connive at infrac  
tions in this shape, than when they had proceeded  
holly from the cabals of the representative  
  
body. Until the people have, by some solemn  
and authoritative act, annulled or changed the  
established form, it is binding upon themselve  
coliectively, as well as individually; and no pre­  
sumption, or even knowledge of their sentiments,  
can wafrant their representatives in a departure  
from it, prior to such an act. But it is easy to  
see, that it would require an uncommon portion  
of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faith  
ful guardians of the Constitution, where legis­  
lative invasions of it had been instigated by the  
major voice of the community

Alex. Hamilton wioto thus : &quot; The  
standard of good behaviour for tho  
continuance in ellice of the judicial  
magis-tracy is certainly one of the most  
valuablo of the modern Improvements in  
tho practica of GovemmeLts. In a  
monarchy, itis an excel-lent barrier to  
the despotism oftho prince ; in a  
republic, it is o no less excellent  
barrier to the encroachments and  
oppressions of tho representative body.  
And it is the best expe-dient which can  
bo devised in any Govern-ment to stcuro  
a steady, upright, and impaitial  
administration oftho laws. Who-ever  
attentively considers tho different de-  
partments of power must porceive that in  
o Government in which they aro separated  
from each other, tho judiciary, from the  
nature of its functions, will always be  
the leoBt dangerous to the political  
rights of the Constitution, because it  
will be least in a cal ncity to annoy or  
it&#x27;juro them. The Executive not only  
dispenses the honours, but holds the  
sword of tho community. The Legislature  
not only commands the puree, but  
prescribes the rules by which the duties  
and rights of every citi-zen are to be  
regulated. The judiciary, on the  
contrary, has no influence over cither  
the sword or the purse-no direc-tion  
either of the Btrength or of the wealth  
of tho society ; and can take no active  
resolu-tion whatever.The genei al  
liberty of the people can never bo  
endangered . . . so long as tho  
judiciary remains truly dis-tinct fiom  
both the LFgislativo and Execu-tive. For  
I agree that tbero is no liberty if the  
power of judging be not separated from

&quot;Whoever attentively considers the  
different denartments of power, must per  
ceive that in a Government in which  
they are separated from each other, the  
Judiciary, from the nature of its fune  
tions, will always be the least dangerous  
to the pofitical rights of the Constitu  
tion, because it will be least in a capac  
ity to annoy or injure them. The Ex­  
ecutive not only dispenses the honors  
but holds the sword of the community  
the Legislature not only commands the  
purse, but prescribes the rules by which  
the duties and rights of every citizen are  
to be regulated; the Judiciary, on the  
contrary, has no influence over either the  
sword or the purse; no direction either  
of the strength or of the wealth of the  
 society, and can take no active resolution  
whatever. It may be truly said to have  
neither force nor will, but merely judg  
ment, and must ultimately depend upon  
the aid of the Executive arm for the effi  
cacious exercise even of this faculty

The complete independence of the

&quot;There is-no:nosifiou&quot;vvhlch depends on  
  
.clearer principles, than that every act of  
  
a&#x27; delegated autnonty, contrary, to inc.

is exercised, Is Toid. No legislative act,  
therefore, contrary to&#x27; the constitution can  
  
be valid: To1 deny this, would be to af-  
  
fitm, that the deputy is greater than Ins.  
  
principal; mat .tnc servant is auove ms  
master; that the representatives of the  
people are superior to the peoplo them­  
selves: thai -men, acting by virtue of pow  
  
ers, may do nDt only what their pow6rs  
  
tlo not auuionze, oui- wnai mey lormu.  
&quot;If it be said that thclegislative body are  
  
themselves the constitutional judges of  
their own powers, and that the construc  
  
tion they put upon tliem is conclusive upon  
the other departments, it may be answered  
  
that this cannot be the natural presump­  
tion, where it is not to be recollected from  
any particular provisions in theconstitution.-  
It is not otherwise to be supposed  
that theconstilution could intend to ena­  
ble the &quot;representatives of tho peoplo to  
  
substitute their will to tliatot uicirconstit  
  
uents. It is far more rational to suppose  
that the courts wero designed to be an in­  
termediate body between the peoplo and  
  
thelegislature, in order, among other tilings.  
  
to keep the latter within the limits as­  
signed to their authority. Tho interpreta­  
tion of the laws is the proper and peculiar  
  
province of the courts. A constitution is,  
  
in fact, and must be regarded by the  
judges as a fundamental law. It must  
therefore belons to them to ascertain its  
  
meaning, as well as the meaning of any  
  
particular act proceeding from the legis  
  
lative body. .If there should happen to  
bo an irreconcilable variance between tho  
  
two, that which has the superior obliga  
  
tion and validity ought of course to be  
  
preferred; m other words the constitution  
  
ought to be preferred to the statute; the  
intention of the people to the intention of  
  
their agents.  
Nor docs the conclusion by any means  
suppose a superiority of the judicial to the  
  
legislative power. It only supposes that  
  
the power of the people is superior to  
both : and that where the will of thelegis  
  
lature declared in its tatutcs, stands in  
  
opposition to that of the people declared  
  
in the constitutipn, the judges ought to be  
governed by the latter rather than the for

ions by the fundamental laws, rather than

 Congress could con­  
sided. The whole aim of the bill is to pre.  
hibit the couits from comparing any law  
with the provisions of the Constitution, and  
to destroy it entirely. The bill tells the  
courts to be blind to the existence of any  
other law than the acts of Congress, and is  
but a long step on the road to a centralized  
despotic power. By thus destroying the  
limitation of the legislative power by writ­  
ten constitutions having the force of law,  
this Radical Senator hoped to subvert our  
entire political system. Read the following  
words from Alexander Hamilton and see if  
they are not apropo :  
There is no liberty if the power of judg  
ing be not separated from the legislative  
and executive powers. The complete in­  
dependence of tbe courts of justice is pecu  
liarly essential in a limited constitution. B  
a limited constitution, I understand one  
which contains certain specified exceptions  
to the legislative authority, sucb, for in­  
stance, as that it shall pass no bills of at  
tainder, no ex jw-sf Jhc&#x27;o laws, and the like.  
Limitations of this kind can be preserved  
in practice no other war than through the  
medium of the courts of justice, whose duty  
  
it must be to declare all acts couDtrary to  
the manifest tenor of the Constitution void.  
Without this, all the reservation of particu  
  
lar rights of privileges would amount  
nothing.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
The Federalist, &quot;respecting the rights of the courts to  
pronounce legislative acts void, because contrary to the  
Constitution, has arisen from an imagination that the  
doctrine would imply a superiority of the Judiciary to  
the legislative power. It is urged that the authority  
which can declare the acts of another void must neces.­  
sarily be supertor to the one whose acts may be declared  
void.  There is no position which depends on  
clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated au  
thority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under  
which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, there­  
fore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valld. To deny  
this would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than  
the principal; that the servant is above his master; that  
the representatives of the people are superior to the  
people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers  
mnay do not only what their powers do not authorize, but  
what they forbid. If it be said that the legislative body  
are themselves the Constitutional judges of their own  
powers, and that the construction tiher put upon them  
is conclusive upon the other depariments, it may be an  
swered, that this cannot be the natural presumption,  
where it is not to be collected from any particular proe­  
visions in the Constitution.  
&quot;It is not otherwise to be supposed that the Constitue­  
tion could intend to enable the representatives of the peo­  
ple to substitute their will for that of their constituents.  
It is far more rational to suppose that the courts were  
designed to be an intermediate body between the people  
and the Legislature, in order, among other things, to  
keep the latter within the limits assigned to their author-­  
ity. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and the  
pecullar provision of the courts. A Constitution is in  
fact, and must be regarded by the judges as a funda-  
mental law. It must therefore belong to them to ascer-  
fain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particn-  
lar act proceeding from the legislative body. If there  
should happen to be an irreconcilable varlance between  
the two, that which has the superior ebligation and va  
lidity, ought of course to be preferred; in other words,  
the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the  
intention of the peopte to the intention of their apents.  
Nor does the conclusion by any means suppose a superi-  
ority of the judicial to the rlegislative power. It only  
supposes that the power of the people is superior to both,  
and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its  
statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, de.­  
clared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be gov  
erned by the latter, rather than the former. They  
to regulate their decisious by the fundamental laws,  
rather than by those which are not fundamental.

ion, and, in any special case, whether they  
have been violated or not.  
  
In other words, there must be some sort of a court to interpret  
the written Constitution. Now, is this court to be identical with,  
or independent of, the Legislature of the Supreme or Federal Go-  
vernment? Is the entire separation of the legislative and the  
judicial functions of government possible in this particular case ;  
and if it is possible, is it desirable? The common objection to  
such a court, and the true answer to it, are thus stated in No. 78 of  
the ‘ Federalist, which is due to the pen of Alexander Hamilton :—  
  
‘Some perplexity respecting the right of the courts to pronounce  
legislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has  
arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a  
superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged  
that the authority which can declare the acts of another void,  
must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared  
void. . .. There is no position which depends on clearer principles,  
than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor  
of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legis-  
lative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid... .  
If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the consti-  
tutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction they  
put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may  
be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where  
it is not to be recollected from any particular provisions in the  
Constitution. ... The interpretation of the laws is the proper and  
peculiar province of the courts. A Constitution is, in fact, and  
must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It must  
therefore belong to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the  
meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative  
body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance  
between the two, that which has the superior obligation and vali

An obvious distinction should be noticed between declaring

both these functions are discharged by the court, but the first

Tho idea that the judiciary is nat­  
urally aggressive and requires watching  
to keep it from infringing on the rights  
of other departments of government is  
not sustained by facts or history. If  
there is one department of the govern­  
ment more constantly and steadily ag­  
gressive than another, it it the legisla­  
tive. The Federalist, No. 78, says:  
Whoever attentively considers the differ­

that, in a government in which they are  
separated from each other, the judiciary,  
from the nature of its function, will al­  
ways be the least dangerous to the political  
rights of the Constitution; because it will  
be least in a capacity to annoy or injure  
them. The executive not only dispenses

the aggressive one and the judiciary tho  
most conservative. As to the rights of  
legislatures to violate the Constitution  
the Federalist says:  
There is no position which depends on  
clearer principles than that every act of a  
delegated authority, contrary to the tenor  
of the commission under which it is exer­  
cised, is void. No legislative act, there­  
fore, contrary to the Constitution, can be  
valid. To deny this would be to affirm  
that the deputy is greater than his princi­  
pal; that the servant is above his in as tar;  
that the representatives of the people ate  
snperior to the people themselves; that  
men acting by virtue of powers may do  
not only what their powers do not author­  
ise, but what they forbid. If it be said  
that the legislative body are themselves  
powers, and that the construction they nut  
upon them is conclusive upon the other  
departments, it may be answered that this  
cannot bo the natural presumption whero  
it is not to be collected from any  
particular provisions of the Consti­  
tution. A constitution is in  
fact, and must Li regarded by the judges  
SB a fundamental iaw. It, therefore, be­  
longs to them to ascertain its meaning, as  
well as the meaning of any particular act  
proceeding Irom the legislative body. If  
there should happen to be an irreconcilable  
variance between the two. that which has  
I the superior obligation and validity ought,  
  
of course, to be preferred; or. in other  
words, the Constitution ought to be pre­

When the Constitution was under discussion before the coun-  
try previous to its adoption this article received special atten-  
tion. The writers of the Federalist published several articles  
on the subject, which were widely read and discussed. One  
of them, No. 78, written by Mr. Hamilton, is directed espe-  
cially to the tenure of office of the judges. He says: “The  
standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the  
judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most valuable of  
the modern improvements in the practice of government. In  
a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the  
prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the  
encroachments and oppressions of the representative body.  
And it is the best expedient which can be devised in any gov-  
ernment to secure a steady, upright and impartial administra-  
tion of the laws.”  
  
And again, after stating that the judiciary is the weakest of  
the three departments of the government, and that though  
oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of jus-  
tice, he says: “The general liberty of the people can never be  
endangered from that quarter ; 1 mean so long as the judiciary  
remains truly distinct from both the legislative and the execu-  
tive. For I agree, that ‘there is no liberty, if the power of  
judging be not separated from the legislative and executive  
powers.’ And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can  
have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have  
everything to fear from its union with either of the other  
departments ; that as all the effects of such union must ensue  
from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstand-  
ing a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from the  
natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy  
of being overpowered, awed or influenced by its co-ordinate  
branches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to  
its firmness and independence as permanency in office, this  
quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable  
ingredient in its constitution, and, in a great measure, as the  
citadel of the public justice and the public security.”

this said—&quot;The standard of good behavior  
for the continuance in office of the  
judges is certainly one of the most  
valuable of the modern improvements in  
the practice of Government. In a  
monarchy it is an excellent barrier to  
the despotism of the prince ; in a  
republic it is ano less excellent  
barrier to the encroachments and  
oppressions of the representative body.  
And it is the best expedient which can  
be devised in any Government to secure a  
steady, upright, and impartial  
administration of the laws. Whoever  
attentively considers&#x27;the different  
departments of power must perceive that,  
ia a Government in which they are  
separated from each other, the  
judiciary, from the nature of its  
functions, will always be the least  
dangerous to the political rights of the  
constitution ; because it will be least  
in a capacity to annoy or injure them.  
The Executive not only dispenses the  
honors, but holds the sword of tho  
community. The Legislature not only  
commands the purse, but prescribes the  
rules by which the duties and rights of  
every citizen are to be regulated. The  
judiciary on the eontrarv has no  
influence over either the sword or tho  
puree, no direction either of the  
strength or of the wealth of the  
society, and can take no active  
resolution whatever. It may truly be  
said to ha.ye neither force nor will,  
but lnendy judgment, and must ultimately  
depend upon the aid of the executive arm  
for the efficacious exercise even of  
this faculty. This simple view of the  
matter euggeste several important  
consequences. It proves incontestibly  
that the judiciary is beyond comparison  
the weakest of the three departments of  
power; that it can never attack with  
success either of the other two ; and  
that all possible care is requisite to  
enable it to defend itself aerainst  
their attacks. It equally proves that  
though individual oppression may now and  
then proceed from the courts of justice,  
tho general liberty of the poojilo can  
never be endangered from that quarter ;  
X mean so long as the judiciary remains  
truly distinct from both tlie  
Legislature and Executive. For I agree  
that there is no liberty, if the power  
of judging be not separated from the  
legislative and exerutive pmverA. It  
proves, in the last place, that as  
lilierty can have nothing to feyr from  
the judiciary alone, but would have  
everything to fear from its union with  
either of the other departments; that as  
all tho effects of such a union must  
ensue from a dependence of the former on  
the latter, notwithstanding a nominal  
and apparent separation; that as from  
the natural feebleness of the judiciary  
it is in continual jeopardy «f being  
overpowered, awed,jjr influenced by its  
co-ordinate branches, that as notiiing  
can contribute so much to its firmness  
and inde]*mdencc as pei-manency in

“Hence it is that there can be but few men in the society

For the interpretation of their common rules the German printers have a  
judiciary department, which is similar to that of the United States, appointed  
by the administration. What Hamilton says (Fed. 78) of the Supreme Court,  
holds true of the German trade courts: ‘‘ They are the citadel of public  
justice and public security”; “‘ The courts must declare the sense of law’’;  
“ They are to exercise judgment and not will,’ and must “ guard the consti-  
tution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill-humors which  
the arts of designing men . . . disseminate among the people themselves.”  
  
Thus, we see that the German printers have fully adopted the salient  
feature of the American Constitution, namely, that it provides for one efficient  
government in three functions. The sovereign power which the trade pos-  
sesses over the customs and usages of its followers is wielded by three  
departments, to each of which is assigned a distinct function, while between  
the different functions there is such a strong tie of mutual support that no
