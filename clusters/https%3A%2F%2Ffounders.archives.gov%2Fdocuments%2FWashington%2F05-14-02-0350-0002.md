ransactions of the United States with the Governments of Morocco &amp; Algiers from  
the close of the late war to that date, he begs leave to refer to them for the state  
of things existing at that time.  
On the 3d of March 1791, the Legislature passed an Act appropriating the sum of  
20,000 Dollars, to the purpose of effecting a recognition of the Treaty of the United  
States with the new Emperor of Morocco, in  
consequence whereof Thomas Barclay, formerly Consul General for the United States in  
France was appointed to proceed to Morocco in the character of Consul for the United  
States, to obtain a recognition of the Treaty; and on the 13th of May in the same year  
the following Letter was written to him.  
  
  
  
To Thomas Barclay Esqr.  
Philadelphia May 13t. 1791.  
Sir  
  
You are appointed by the President of the United States to go to the Court of  
Morocco for the purpose of obtaining from the new Emperor a recognition of our  
Treaty with his father. As it is thought best that you should go in some definite  
character, that of Consul has been adopted, and you consequently receive a  
Commission as Consul for the United States, in the dominions of the Emperor of  
Morocco, which having been issued during the recess of the Senate, will of course  
expire at the end of their next session. It has been thought best however not to  
insert this limitation in the Commission as being unnecessary, and it might  
perhaps embarrass. Before the end of the next session of the Senate it is expected  
the objects of your mission will be accomplished.  
Lisbon being the most convenient port of correspondence between us and Morocco, sufficient authority will be given to Col. Humphreys, Resident  
for the United States at that place, over funds in Amsterdam for the objects of  
your mission. On him therefore you will draw for the sums herein allowed, or such  
parts of them as shall be necessary. To that port too, you had better proceed in  
the first vessel which shall be going there, as it is expected you will get a  
ready passage from thence to Morocco.  
On your arrival in Morocco, sound your ground, and know how things stand at  
present. Your former voyage there having put you  
in possession of the characters through whom this may be done, who may best be  
used for approaching the Emperor and effecting your purpose, you are left to use  
your own knowledge to the best advantag

On Mr Barclay’s arrival in Europe he learned that the dominions of Morocco were  
involved in a general Civil war, the subject of which was the succession to the  
Throne, then in dispute between several of the Sons of the late Emperor: nor had any  
one of them such a preponderance as to ground a presumption that a recognition of the  
Treaty by him would ultimately be effectual. Mr Barclay therefore took measures

On the 8th of May 1792, the President proposed to the Senate the following  
questions.  
  
  
  
If the President of the United States should conclude a Convention or Treaty with  
the Government of Algiers for the ransom of the thirteen Americans in captivity  
there, for a sum not exceeding forty thousand dollars, all  
expenses included, will the Senate approve the same? Or is there any, and what  
greater or lesser sum, which they would fix on as the limit beyond which they  
would not approve the ransom?  
If the President of the Unites States should conclude a Treaty with the  
Government of Algiers for the establishment of peace with them at an expense not  
exceeding twenty five thousand dollars paid at the signature, and a like sum to be  
paid annually afterwards during the continuance of the Treaty, would the Senate  
approve the same? Or are there any greater or lesser sums which they would fix on

establish the rate of ransom of American captives with the Barbary States at as  
low a point as possible, that it may not be the interest of those States to go in  
quest of our Citizens in preference to those of other countries. Had it not been

“It has been a fixed principle with Congress to es-  
tablish the rate of ransom of American captives with  
the Barbary States at as low a point as possible, that  
it may not be the interest of those States to go in  
quest of our citizens in preference to those of other  
countries, Had it not been for the danger it would  
have brought on the residue of our seamen, by ex-  
citing the cupidity of these rovers against them, our  
citizens now in Algiers would have been long ago re-  
deemed, without regard to price. The mere money  
for their particular redemption neither has been nor  
is an object with anybody here.”—State Papers, vol.
