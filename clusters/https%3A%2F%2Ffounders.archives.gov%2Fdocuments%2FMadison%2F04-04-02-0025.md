The Students of the Medical school shall be permitted to attend with the Professor, to examine the patients by the pulse, and other indications of disease, to ask of them such questions as the Professor shall think pertinent, and shall permit, and to acquire practical knolege of the processes of Pharmacy by taking a part in the preparation of medecines.  
The monies so recieved shall be applied to the providing &amp; keeping up a proper and sufficient stock of medecines and salves, to the procuring Surgical instruments for ordinary operations, and to defraying other expences necessary for the institution. For the first stock of medecines, and for necessary instruments, money shall be advanced from the funds of the University to be reimbursed from the reciepts of the Dispensary.

and closing the three earlier schools of the day, and that now latest shall take the earliest hours of it’s day, which shall continue until the 1st. of February following, when there shall again be a similar advance and change of two hours, and like changes shall continue to be made, on the same days in every year after.

The President shall be the chief executive officer of the University, and as such, charged with a general superintendance of the execution of all laws made for it’s government.  
The Proctor and all subordinate agents shall be subject to his controul and direction in the execution of their respective duties.  
He shall convene the Faculty whenever he may think the interests of the institution require it, and whenever else any two Professors shall request it.  
He shall preside at all the meetings of the Faculty, when present, and having a vote as professor, he shall have a casting vote as president, when the votes of the Professors, pro and con, are equally divided.

stablishing the office of President, the Rector dissented. His dissent is ordered to be entered in the Journal, and is in the words following.  
The subscriber, Rector of the University, fully and expressly concurring in the appointment of William Wirt to be Professor of the school of Law, dissents from, and protests against so much of these enactments as go to the establishment of the office of President of the University, for these reasons.  
1. Because the Law establishing the University, delineating the organisation of the authorities by which it should be directed and governed, and placing at it’s head a board of Rector and Visitors, has enumerated with great precision the special powers it meant to give to that board, in which enumeration is not to be found that of creating a President, making him a member of the Faculty of Professors, and with controuling powers over that Faculty: and it is not conceivable that, while descending, in their enumeration, to give specifically the power of appointing officers of the minutest grade, they should have omitted to name him of the highest, who was to govern and preside over the whole. If this is not among the enumerated powers, it is believed it cannot be legitimately inferred, by construction, from the words giving a general authority to do all things expedient for promoting the purposes of the Institution; for, so construed, it would render nugatory the whole enumeration, and confer on the board powers unrestrained within any limits.  
2. Because he is of opinion that every function ascribed to the President by this enactment, can be performed, and is now as well performed by the Faculty, as now established by law.  
3. Because we owe debts at this time of at least 11,000. Dollars beyond what can be paid by any means we have in possession, or may command within any definite period of time; and fixes on us permanently an additional expence of 1500. Dollars a year.  
4. Because he thinks that so fundamental a change in the organisation of the Institution ought not to be made by a thin board, two of the seven constituting it, being now absent.  
For these reasons the subscriber protests against both the expediency and validity of the establishment of this office.

erence to the government of the country.  
It is as follows:  
“The subscriber, rector of the Uni­  
versity, fully and expressly concurring in  
the appointment of William Wirt to be  
professor of the school of law, dissents  
from and protests against so much of  
these enactments as go to the establish­  
ment of the office of president of the Uni­  
versity, for these reasons:  
“1. Because the law establishing the  
University, delineating the organization  
of the authorities by which it should be  
directed and governed, and placing at its  
head a Board of Rector and Visitors, has  
enunciated with precision the special  
powens it meant to give that board, in  
which enumeration is not to be found  
that of creating a president, making him  
a member of the faculty of professors,  
and with controlling powers over that  
faculty; and it is not conceivable that,  
while descending in their enumeration,  
to give specifically the power of appoint­  
ing officers of the minutest grade, they  
should have omitted to name him of the  
highest who was to govern and preside  
over the whole; if this is not among the  
enumerated powers, it is believed It can­  
not be legitimately inferred by construc­  
tion from the words giving a general au­  
thority to do all things expedient for pro­  
moting the purposes of the institution;  
for, so construed, it would render nuga­  
tory the whole enumeration, and confer  
on the board powers unrestrained within  
any limit*.  
“2. Because he is of opinion that ev­  
ery function ascribed to the president by  
this enactment can be performed, and is  
now as well performed by the faculty, as  
now established by law.  
“3. Because we owe debts at this time  
of at least SII,OOO beyond what can be  
paid by any means we have in posses­  
sion or may command within any definite  
period of time ,and fixes on us permanent­  
ly an additional expense of $1,500 a year.  
“4. Because he thinks that so funda­  
mental a change in the organization of  
the institution ought not to be made by  
a thin board, two of the seven constitut­  
ing it, being now absent.  
“For these reasons the subscriber pro­  
tests against the expediency and the va­  
lidity of the establishment of this office.  
“(Signed.) TH. JEFFERSON.

minutes in his own hand his dissent from the ac-

his opposition to the presidency the followins.  
which I copy from the vellowed rages of the first  
book of minutes of the Board of Visitors of the  
University of Virginla: &quot;Because the law estab­

of the authority by which it should be directed and

the special powers it meant to sive that noard, in  
which enumeration is not to be found that of creat­

descending in their enumeration to give specifically  
the power of appointing officers of the minutest  
grade, they should have omitted to name him of  
the hishest, who was to govern and preaide over  
the whole. If this is not among the enumerated  
powers, it is belleved it cannot be legitimately in­  
ferred, by construction, from the words siving a  
general authority to do all things expedient for  
promoting the purposes of the institution, for; so
