General, who, with the Adjutant General, is to see that they, together with those in store, are duly and justly allotted to the regimental overseers of the work; who are to keep an account of the men’s names, into whose hands they are placed, that they may be accountable for them—The Superintendents and Overseers are to be exempt from all other duty, and will moreover be allowed for their trouble.  
The Colonels, or commanding officers of regiments, with their Captains, are immediately to cause their men to be divided into squads of twelve, and see that each squad have their proportion of tools, and set about a hut for themselves: And as an encouragement to industry and art, the General promises to reward the party in each regiment, which finishes their hut in the quickest, and most workmanlike manner, with twelve dollars—And as there is reason to believe, that boards, for covering, may be found scarce and difficult to be got—He offers One hundred dollars to any officer or soldier, who in the opinion of three Gentlemen, he shall appoint as judges, shall substitute some other covering, that may be cheaper and quicker made, and will in every respect answer the end.  
The Soldier’s huts are to be of the following dimensions—viz.—fourteen by sixteen each—sides, ends and roofs made with logs, and the roof made tight with split slabs—or in some other way—the sides made tight with clay—fire-place made of wood and secured with clay on the inside eighteen inches thick, this fire-place to be in the rear of the hut—the door to be in the end next the street—the doors to be made of split oak-slabs, unless boards can be procured—Side-walls to be six and a half-feet high—The officers huts to form a line in the rear of the troops, one hut to be allowed to each General Officer—one to the Staff of each brigade—one to the field officers of each regiment—one to the staff of each regiment—one to the commissioned officers  
  
of two companies—and one to every twelve non-commissioned officers and soldiers.

ines of the bleak forest, from men who, to all  
human appearance, had little to be thankful for,  
except nakedness, famine, and frost. The next  
day the work of hutting commenced. Each re-  
giment was divided into parties of twelve, each  
party to make its own hut, which was to be of  
logs, fourteen by sixteen feet on the ground, and  
six feet and a-half high. The sides were to be  
made tight with clay, and the roof with split  
slabs, or such material as could be obtained. To  
stimulate the parties to greater exertion, Wash-  
ington offered a reward of one dollar to a man to  
that party which finished its hut in the quickest  
and most workmanlike manner. Fearing that  
there would not be slabs or boards sufficient for  
roofing, he offered a reward, also, of a hundred  
doliars to any one who should “substitute some  
other covering,” that might be more cheaply and  
quickly made. In a short time the arms were all  
stacked, and with their axes and other tools in

day of thanksgiving and praise, and on the morn-

allow them to work in the open air. Some cut  
down trees, others fashioned them, and in a few  
days the barracks, erected upon the plan of a regu-
