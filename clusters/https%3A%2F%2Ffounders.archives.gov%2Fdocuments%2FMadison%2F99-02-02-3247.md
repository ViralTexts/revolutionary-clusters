Richmond,  
  
March 22d, 1836.  
  
  
  
You expressed a wish (page -- vol. III,) to obtain information in relation to the history of the emancipated  
people of color in Prince Edward; I presume those emancipated by the late Richard Randolph more especially.  
More than twenty-five years ago, I think, they were liberated, at which time they numbered about one hundred,  
and were settled upon small parcels of land, of perhaps 10 to twenty-five acres, to each family. As long as the habits of  
industry, which they had acquired while slaves, lasted, they continued to increase in numbers, and lived in some degree of  
comfort--but as soon as this was lost, and most of those who had been many years in slavery either died, or became old and  
infirm, and a new race, raised in idleness and vice, sprang up, they began not only to be idle and vicious, but to  
diminish instead of increasing, and have continued to diminish in numbers very regularly every year--and that too, without  
emigration; for they have almost without exception, remained together in the same situation as at first placed, to this  
day. Idleness, poverty, and dissipation, are the agents which continue to diminish their numbers, and to render them  
wretched in the extreme, as well as a great pest, and heavy tax upon the neighborhood in which they live. There is so  
little of industry, and so much dissipation amongst them, that it is impossible that the females can rear their families  
of children--and the consequence is, that they prostitute themselves, and consequently, have few children--and the  
operation of time, profligacy and disease, more than keep pace with any increase among them. Whilst they are a very great  
pest and heavy tax upon the community, it is most obvious, they themselves are infinitely worsted by the exchange from  
slavery to liberty--if, indeed, their condition deserves that name.

Richmond, March 23, 1$3G.  
You expressed a wish (page?, vol 3d/,  
to obtain information in relation to the  
* history of the emancipated slaves in Prince  
f Edward ; I presume those emancipated  
by the late Richard Randolph more especially.  
More than twenty-live years ago, I think ;  
they were liberated, at which liuie tlicy |  
numbered about one hundred, and were i  
settled upon small parcels of land of fioin j  
10 to 25 acres to each family. As long-j  
as the habits of industry, which thev had i  
acquired while slaves, lasted, they continu- !  
cd to increase in numbers, and lived in  
some degree of comfort; but as soon as  
this was lost, and most of those v.ho had  
been many years in slavery cither died or  
became old and infirm, and a new race, j  
raised in. idleness and vice, sprang up, j  
they began not only to be idle and vicious,  
- i i _ &quot;1 1 ?tw| ,  
  
OUl 10 Oimillisn 111SICUU Ul tlirirasmg, ?.?u  
have continued to diminish in numbers  
very regularly every year?and that, too, j  
although they all without exception re- i  
maincd together in the same situation as  
at first placed, to this day.  
Idleness, poverty and,dissipation arc the i  
agents which continue to diminish their j  
numbers, and to r~~dcr them wretched  
in the extreme, as well as a great pest and j  
heavy tax upon the neighborhood in which ,  
they live. There is so little industry and ,  
so much dissipation amongst them, that it :  
is impossible the females can rear their i  
families of children?and the consequence 1  
is, that they prostitute themselves, and  
consequently have few children; and the  
operations of time, profligacy, and disease  
more than keep pace with any increase!  
among them. Whilst they are a very j  
great pest and heavy tax upon the com- i  
inunity, it is most obvious they themselves J  
are infinitely worsted by the exchange I  
from slavery to liberty ; if, indeed, their  
condition deserves that name.

venerable Madison, in answer to an en­  
quiry relative to the condition of certain  
emancipated negroes in Prince Edward,Va.  
states they are idle, vicious, and given to  
every .species of dissipation, in consequence  
of Wich they have annually decreased.  
These people were more than twenty five  
years ago liberated by Richard Randolph,  
at which time theynumberedabnut 100, &amp;  
were settled upon parcels ofland from, 10  
to 0 acres, apportioned to each family.  
As long as the habits of industryjacquired  
whilst slaves, lasted, they lived with sortie  
degree- of comfort; but those habits soon  
were thrown aside, and slothfulness and  
crime crept in amongst them, which was  
transferred to the present descendants who  
are profligate and corrupt, and a pest and  
serious tax to the neighborhood in which  
  
they Are at present settled.
