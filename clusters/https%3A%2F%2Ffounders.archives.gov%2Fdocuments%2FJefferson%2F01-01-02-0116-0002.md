Philadelphia, July 31, 1775.  
  
In Congress.  
THE several Assemblies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia, having refered to the Congress a resolution of the House of Commons of Great Britain, which resolution is in these words, viz.  
Lunae, 20° die Feb. 1775.  
The House in a Committee on the American papers. Motion made, and question proposed.  
That it is the opinion of this Committee, that when the General Council and Assembly, or General Court of any of his Majesty’s provinces, or colonies in America, shall propose to make provision, according to the condition, circumstance, or situation of such province or colony, for contributing their proportion to the common defence (such proportion to be raised under the authority of the General Court, or General Assembly of such province or colony, and disposable by Parliament) and shall engage to make provision also, for the support of the civil  government, and the Administration of justice in such province or colony, it will be proper if such proposal shall be approved by his Majesty and the two Houses of Parliament; and for so long as such provision shall be made accordingly, to forbear in respect of such province or colony, to lay any duty, tax, or assessment, or to impose any further duty, tax or assessment, except only such duties as it may be expedient to continue to levy or impose, for the regulation of commerce, the net produce of the duties last mentioned, to be carried to the account of such province or colony respectively.  
The Congress took the said resolution into consideration, and are thereupon of opinion:  
That the colonies of America are entitled to the sole and exclusive privilege of giving and granting their own money; that this involves a right of deliberating whether they will make any gift, for what purposes it shall be made, and what shall be it’s amount; and that it is a high breach of this privilege for any body of men, extraneous to their constitutions, to prescribe the purposes for which money shall be levied on them, to take to themselves the authority of judging of their conditions, circumstances and situations; and of determining the amount of the contribution to be levied.  
That as the colonies possess a right of appropriating their gifts, so are they entitled at all times to enquire into their application, to see that they be not wasted among the venal and corrupt for the purpose of undermining the civil rights of the givers, nor yet be diverted to the support of standing armies, inconsistent with their freedom and subversive of their quiet. To propose therefore, as this resolution does, that the monies given by the colonies shall be subject to the disposal of parliament alone, is to propose that they shall relinquish this right of enquiry, and put it in the power of others to render their gifts, ruinous, in proportion as they are liberal.  
That this privilege of giving or of witholding our monies is an important barrier against the undue exertion of prerogative, which if left altogether without controul may be exercised to our great oppression; and all history shews how efficacious is its intercession for redress of grievances and re-establishment of rights, and how improvident it would be to part with so powerful a mediator.  
We are of opinion that the proposition contained in this resolution is unreasonable and insidious: unreasonable, because, if we declare we accede to it, we declare without reservation, we will purchase the favour of Parliament, not knowing at the same time at what price they will please to estimate their favor: It is insidious, because, individual colonies, having bid and bidden again, till they find the avidity of the seller too great for all their powers to satisfy; are then to return into opposition, divided from their sister colonies whom the minister will have previously detached by a grant of easier terms, or by an artful procrastination of a definitive answer.  
That the suspension of the exercise of their pretended power of taxation being expressly made commensurate with the continuance of our gifts, these must be perpetual to make that so. Whereas no experience  has shewn that a gift of perpetual revenue secures a perpetual return of duty or of kind disposition. On the contrary, the Parliament itself, wisely attentive to this observation, are in the established practice of granting their supplies from year to year only.  
Desirous and determined as we are to consider in the most dispassionate view every seeming advance towards a reconciliation made by the British Parliament, let our brethren of Britain reflect what would have been the sacrifice to men of free spirits had even fair terms been proffered, as these insidious proposals were with circumstances of insult and defiance. A proposition to give our money, accompanied with large fleets and armies, seems addressed to our fears rather than to our freedom. With what patience would Britons have received articles of treaty from any power on earth when borne on the point of a bayonet by military plenipotentiaries?  
We think the attempt unnecessary to raise upon us by force or by threats our proportional contributions to the common defence, when all know, and themselves acknowledge we have fully contributed, whenever called upon to do so in the character of freemen.  
We are of opinion it is not just that the colonies should be required to oblige themselves to other contributions, while Great Britain possesses a monopoly of their trade. This of itself lays them under heavy contribution. To demand therefore, additional aids in the form of a tax, is to demand the double of their equal proportion, if we are to contribute equally with the other parts of the empire, let us equally with them enjoy free commerce with the whole world. But while the restrictions on our trade shut to us the resources of wealth, is it just we should bear all other burthens equally with those to whom every resource is open.  
We conceive that the British Parliament has no right to intermeddle with our provisions for the support of civil government, or administration of justice. The provisions we have made are such as please ourselves, and are agreeable to our own circumstances; they answer the substantial purposes of government and of justice, and other purposes than these should not be answered. We do not mean that our people shall be burthened with oppressive taxes to provide sinecures for the idle or the wicked, under colour of providing for a civil list. While Parliament pursue their plan of civil government within their own jurisdiction, we also hope to pursue ours without molestation.  
We are of opinion the proposition is altogether unsatisfactory because it imports only a suspension of the mode, not a renunciation of the pretended right to tax us: Because too it does not propose to repeal the several Acts of Parliament passed for the purposes of restraining the trade and altering the form of government of one of our Colonies; extending the boundaries and changing the government of Quebec; enlarging the jurisdiction of the Courts of Admiralty and Vice Admiralty; taking from us the rights of trial by a Jury of the vicinage in cases affecting both life and property; transporting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offences; exempting by mock-trial the murderers of Colonists from punishment; and quartering soldiers on us in times of profound peace. Nor do they renounce the power of suspending  our own Legislatures, and of legislating for us themselves in all cases whatsoever. On the contrary, to shew they mean no discontinuance of injury, they pass acts, at the very time of holding out this proposition, for restraining the commerce and fisheries of the Provinces of New-England, and for interdicting the trade of other Colonies with all foreign nations and with each other. This proves unequivocally they mean not to relinquish the exercise of indiscriminate legislation over us. Upon the whole, this proposition seems to have been held up to the world, to deceive it into a belief that there was nothing in dispute between us but the mode of levying taxes; and that the Parliament having now been so good as to give up this, the Colonies are unreasonable if not perfectly satisfied: Whereas in truth, our adversaries still claim a right of demanding ad libitum, and of taxing us themselves to the full amount of their demand, if we do not comply with it. This leaves us without any thing we can call property. But, what is of more importance, and what in this proposal they keep out of sight, as if no such point was now in contest between us, they claim a right to alter our Charters and established laws, and leave us without any security for our Lives or Liberties. The proposition seems also to have been calculated more particularly to lull into fatal security our well-affected fellow subjects on the other side the water, till time should be given for the operation of those arms, which a British Minister pronounced would instantaneously reduce the “cowardly” sons of America to unreserved submission. But when the world reflects, how inadequate to justice are these vaunted terms; when it attends to the rapid and bold succession of injuries, which, during a course of eleven years, have been aimed at these Colonies; when it reviews the pacific and respectful expostulations, which, during that whole time, were the sole arms we opposed to them; when it observes that our complaints were either not heard at all, or were answered with new and accumulated injury; when it recollects that the Minister himself on an early occasion declared, “that he would never treat with America, till he had brought her to his feet,” and that an avowed partisan of Ministry has more lately denounced against us the dreadful sentence “delenda est Carthago,” that this was done in presence of a British Senate, and being unreproved by them, must be taken to be their own sentiment, (especially as the purpose has already in part been carried into execution by their treatment of Boston, and burning of Charlestown) when it considers the great armaments with which they have invaded us, and the circumstances of cruelty with which these have commenced and prosecuted hostilities; when these things, we say, are laid together, and attentively considered, can the world be deceived into an opinion that we are unreasonable, or can it hesitate to believe with us, that nothing but our own exertions may defeat the ministerial sentence of death or abject submission.  
By Order of the Congress,  
  
John Hancock, President.

ent to continue to levy or impoſe; for the regulation of

The Congreſs took the faid reſolution into cenſide-  
ration, and are thereupon of opinion,  
  
THAT the colonies of America are entitled to  
the ſole and excluſive privilege of giving and  
granting their own money : that this involves a  
right of deliberating whether they will make any  
gift, for what purpoſes it ſhall be made, and  
what ſhall be it&#x27;s amount: and that it is a high.  
  
S  
  
  
traneous to their conſtitutions, to preſcribe the  
purpoſes for which money ſhall be levied on them,  
to take to themſelves the authority of judging of  
their conditions, circumſtances and ſituations, and  
  
of determining the amount of the contribution to  
be levied.  
  
Tra as the colonies poſicfs a right of appro-  
priating their gifts, ſo are they entitled at all times  
to enquire into their application, to ſee that they  
be not waſted among the venal and corrupt for the  
  
  
ers, nor yet be diverted to the ſupport of ſtandin  
armies; inconſiſtent: with their freedom and ſub-  
verſive of their quiet. Lo propole therefore, as.  
  
  
| colonies ſhall be ſubject to the diſpoſal of Parlia-  
  
2  
  
  
ment t alone, is to . that they mall relinquiſh  
this right of enquiring, and put it in the power of  
Others to render their gifts reinous, in proportion  
as they are liberal.  
  
Taar this privilege of giving or with. holding  
our monies is an important barrier againſt the un-  
due exertion of prerogative, which, if left altoge-  
ther without controul, may be exerciſed to ur  
great oppreſſion; and all hiſtory ſhews how effica-

having referred to the Congrefs a refo-  
lution of the Houfe of Commons of  
Great. Britain, (for which fee Febru-  
ary Mag. p. sor) the Congrefs took  
the faid refolution into confideration,  
and are thereupon of opinion, :  
  
THAT the colonies of America  
are entitled to the sole and exciuiive  
privilege of giving and gianting their  
own money : that this involves a right  
of deliberating whether they will make  
any gift, for what purpofes it fhall be  
made, and what fhall be its amount ?  
and that it is a high breach of this pri-  
vilege for any body of men, extrane-  
ous te their conftitutions, to prefcribe  
the purpofes for which money fhail be  
levied on them, to take to theméelves  
the authority of judging of their con-  
dition, circumfances, and fituations,  
and of determining the amount of the  
contributions to be levied.  
  
That, as the colonies poffefs a right  
of appropriating their gifts, fo are they  
entitled at all times to enquire into  
their application, to fee that they be  
not wafted among the venal and cor-  
rupt, for the purpofe of undermining  
the civil rights of the givers, nor yet  
be diverted to the fupport of ttanding  
armies, inconfiftent with their freedom,  
and fubverfive of their quiet. To pio-  
pole, therefore, as this refolution does,  
that the monies given by the colonies  
fhall be fubjcét to the difpofal of par-  
Jiament alone, is to propole that they  
fhall relinquifh this right of enquiring,  
and put it in the power of others to  
render their gifts ruinous, in propor-  
tion as they afe liberal.  
  
That this privilege of givirg or with-  
holding our. monies, is an important  
barrier againft the undue exertion of  
prevogative, which, if left altogether  
  
without controul, may be exerciled te  
our great oppreffion; and all hiftory  
flhews, how efficacious is its interci flion  
for redrefs of guievances, and re-efta-  
blifhment of rights, and how improvi«  
dent it would be to part with fo powers  
ful a mediator.  
  
We are of opinion that the propofi-  
tion contained in this refolution is une  
reafonable and infidious : unreafonable,  
becaufe, if we declare we accede to it,  
we declare without refervation, we will  
purchafe the favour of parliament, not  
knowing at the fame time at what price  
they will pleafe to eftimate their favour:  
it is infidious, becaufe individual colo-  
nies, having bid and bidden again, till  
they find the avidity of the feller too  
great for all their powers to fatisfy, are  
then to return into oppofition, divided  
from their fifter colonies, whom the  
minifter will have previoufly detached

artful procraltination of a definitive

 the Britihh Parlia-  
ment has no right to intermeddle with  
our provifions for the fuppoit of civil  
government, or adminiftration of juf-  
tice. The provifions we have made  
are fuch as pleafe ourfelves, and are  
agreeabie to our own circumftances:  
they anfwer the fubftantial purpofes of  
government and of juftice, and other  
purpofes than thefe fhould not be an-  
fwered. We do not mean that our  
people thall be burthened with oppref-  
five taxes, to provide finecures for the

providing for a civil lift, While par-  
hiament purfue their plan of civil go-  
wernment within their own jurifdic-

We are of opinion the propofition is  
altogether unfatisfagtory, becaule it im-  
ports only a fufpenfion of the mode,  
not a renunciation of the pretended  
right to tax us; becaufe, too, it does  
not propofe to repeal the feveral aés of

reftraining the trade, and altering the  
form of government of one of our co-  
Jonies; extending the boundaries, and  
changing the government of Quebec ;  
enlarging the jurifdi&amp;ion of the courts  
of Admiralty and Vice- Admiralty ;  
taking from us the rights of trial by  
jury of the vicinage, in cafes affecting  
both life and property ; traniporting us  
into other countries to be tried for cri-  
minal offences; exempting, by mock-  
trial, the murderers of colonifts from  
punifhment; and quartering foldiers  
on us in times of profound peace. Nor  
do they renorthce the power of fufpend-  
ing our own legiflatures, and of legi-  
flating for us themfelves in all cafes  
whatfoever. On the contrary, to thew  
they mean no difcontjnuance of injury,  
  
they pafs aéts, at the very ume of hold«  
  
ing out this propofition, for reftraining  
the commerce and fiferies of the pro-  
vinces of New-England, and for inter  
dicting the trade of other colonies with  
all foreign nations, and with each  
other. This proves unequivocally they  
mean not to relinquith the exercife of  
  
indifcriminate legiflation over us.  
Upon the whole, this propofition  
feems to have been held up to the  
world, to deceive it-into a belef, that  
there was nothing in difpute between  
us but the mode of levying taxes; and  
that the parliament having now beea  
fo good as to give up this, the colonies  
are unreafonable if not perfe&amp;tly fatis-  
fied: whereas, in truth, our adveria-  
ries ftill claim a right of demanding ad  
libitum, and of taxing us themfelves to  
the full amount of their demand, if  
we do not comply with it. This leaves  
us without any thing we can call pro  
perty. But, what is of more impor-  
tance, and what is the propofal they  
keep ont of fight, as if no fuch point  
was now in conteft between us, they.  
claim a right to alter our charters and  
eftablifh laws, and leave us without  
any fecurity for our lives or liberties,  
The propofition feems alfo to have  
been calculated more particularly to  
lull into fatal fecurity our well-affe&amp;ca  
fellow-fubje&amp;ts on the other fide of the  
water, till time fhould be given for the  
operation of thofe arms, which a Bri-  
tith minifter. pronounced would inftane  
taneoufly reduce the *‘ cowardly” fons  
of America to unreferved fubmiffion.  
But when the world refle&amp;ts how ina-  
dequate to juftice are thefe vaunted  
terms; when it attends to the rapid and  
bold fucceffion of injuries, which, dur.  
ing a courle of eleven years, have been  
aimed at thefe colonies; when it ree  
views the pacific and refpeétful expo-

time, were the fole arms we oppofed to  
them; when it obferves that our coms

were anfwered with new and accumu.  
lated injury; when it recollects that  
the minster himfelf, on an eatly occa-  
fion, declared, ** that he would never  
treat with America, till he brought her  
to his feet ;** and that an avowed parti-  
fan of miniftry has more lately de-  
nounced fentence againft us, the dread~

thefe have commenced and profecuted

are laid together, and attentively con-  
fidered, can the world be deceived into  
an opinion that we are unreafonable ?

The Congrefs took the faid refolution  
into confideration, and are thereupon of  
opinion :  
  
That the propofition, contained in this  
refolution, is unreafonable and infidious ;  
unreafonable, becaufe, if we declare we  
accede to it, we declare, without referva-  
tion, we will purchafe the favour of Parli-  
ament, not knowing at the fame time, at  
what price they will pleafe to eftimate their  
favour: It is infidious, becaufe individual  
Colonies, having bid and bidden again,  
till they find the avidity of the feller too  
great for all their powers to fatisfy, are  
then to return into oppofition, divided trom  
their fifter Colonies, whom the Minifter  
will have previoufly detached by a grant of  
eafier terms, or by an artful procraflina-  
tion of a definitive anfwer.  
  
After confidering the other parts of the  
above refolution, as deftructive of the A-  
merican Liberties, the Congrefs conclude in  
thefe words :  
  
Upon the whole, this propofition feems  
to have been held up to the world, to de-  
ceive it into a belief that there was nothing  
in difpute bétween us but the mode of  
levying taxes; and that, the Parliament  
having now been fo good as to give up  
this, the Colonies are unreafonable, if not  
pertetly fatisfied ; whereas, in truth, our  
adverfaries ftill claim a right of demanding  
ad Jibitum, and of taxing us themfelves to  
the full amount of their demand, if we do  
not comply with it. This leaves us with-  
out any thing we can call property. But,  
what is of more importance, and which is  
the propofal they keep out of fight, as if  
no fuch point was now in conteft between  
us, they claim a right to alter our char-  
ters and eftablith laws, and leave us without  
  
any fecurity for our lives or liberties.  
The propotition frems alfo to have been  
calculated more particularly to lull into  
fatal fecurity our well-affected fellow-fub-  
jects on the other fide of the water, till tne  
fhould be given for the operation of thofe  
arms which a Britihh Minifter pronoun-  
ced would inftantaneoufly reduce the ¢ cow-  
ardly’ fons of America to unreferved fub-  
miffion. But when the world reflects  
how inadequate to jultice are thefe vaunted  
terms; when it attends to the rapid and  
bold fucceffion of injuries, which, during  
a courfe of eleven years, have been aimed at  
thefe Colonies ; when it reviews the pacific

and that an avowed partifan of Miniitry

hew efficacious is its interceffion for redrefs of  
grievances, and re-eftablifhment of sights, and  
how improvident it would be to part with fo

pretcnied power of taxation being expre(sly

Defirous and determined as we are to confider

The congrefs took the faid refolution  
into confideration, and are thereupon  
of opinion :  
  
That the colonies of America are  
entitled to the fole and exclufive privi-  
lege of giving and granting their own  
  
: that this involvesa right of de-  
liberating whether they will make any  
gift, for what purpofes it fhall be made,  
and what fhall be its amount ; and that  
it isa high breach of.this privilege for  
any body of men, extraneous to their  
conftitutions, to prefcribe the purpofes  
for which money fhall be levied on  
them, to take to themfelves the autho-  
rity of judging of their condition, cir-  
cumftances, and fituations, and of de-  
termining the amount of the contribu-  
tions to be levied.  
  
That as the colonies poffefs a right  
of appropriating their gifts, fo are they  
intitled at all times to inquire into  
their application, to fee that they be  
not wafted among the venal and cor-  
rupt for the purpofe of undermining  
the civil rights of the givers, nor yet  
be diverted to the fup of ftanding  
armies, inconfiftent with their freedom,  
and fubverfive of their quiet. To pro-  
pofe, therefore, as this refolution S,  
that the monies given by the colonies  
thall be fubject to the difpofal of parlia-  
ment alone, is to propofe that they  
fhall relinquith this right of enquiring,  
and put it in the power of other&#x27;s to  
render their gifts ruinous in proportion  
as they are li . ,  
  
That this privilege of giving or wig  
holding our monies, is an jm  
barrier againft the undue exertion  
prerogative, which, if left altogethe  
without controul, may be exercifes  
our great Oppreffion ; and all hit  
fhews, how efficacious is its inte  
for redrefs of grievances, and re-eh  
blithment of rights, and how imor  
dent it would be to part with fo powe  
ful a mediator.  
  
_ We are of opinion that the prope  
tion contained in this refolution, js g  
reafonable and infidious ; unreafona  
becaufe, if we declare we accede to  
we declare-without refervation, we  
roe the favour of parliament, 1  
  
nowing at the fame time at wh  
price they will pleafe to eftimate the

dual colonies, having bid and bidé  
again, till they find the avidity of  
feller too great for all their powers  
fatisfy, are then to return into opp  
tion, divided from their fifer coloni  
whom the minifter will have previo  
detached by a grant of eafier terms,  
by an artful procraftination of a det

muft be perpetual to make that

OP Po DOr De  
  
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.  
Philadelphia, July 33, 1775.  
TT HE feveral Atlemblies o1 New-jeriey,

ferred to the Congrefy a refolution of the f,  
Houle of Commons of Great-Britain, which

The Houfe in a Committee on the Ame-

“ That it is the opinion of this Commit-

fuch duties as it may be expedient to conti-  
nue t levy or impofe tor the regulation of  
commerce; the net produce of the duties  
la(t mentioned, to be carried to the account  
of fuch province or colony refpeétively.”  
  
he . ongrefs tock the faid refolution into  
contideration, and are thereupon of opinion,  
  
That the colonies ot America are entitled  
to the fole and exclufive privilege of giving  
and granting their own money: That this  
involves aright of deliberating whether they  
will wiase any gift, for what purpofes it fhall  
be made, and what thall be its amount; and  
thacitis a high breach of this privilege for  
any body of men extraneous to their con-  
ftitutions, to prefcribe the purpofes for which  
money fhail be levied on them, to take to  
themfelves the authority of judging of their  
conditions, circumitances, and fituations,  
and of determining the amount of the con-  
tribution to be levied  
That as the colonics poffefs a right of ap  
ropriating t eir gifts, fo are they entitled  
at all times to enquire into their application,  
to fee that they be not wafted among the ve-  
nal and corrupt for the purpofe of under-  
mining the civil rights of the givers, nor yet  
be diverted to the fupport of ftanding armies,  
inconfitent with their f eedom, and fubver-  
five of their quiet. To propofe, therefore,  
as this refolution does. that the monies given  
by the colonies thail be fubje&amp; to the dif  
pofal of Par iament alone, is to propofe that  
they thall relingquith this right of enquiring,  
and put it in the power of others to render  
their gifts ruinous, in proportion as they  
are liberal,  
  
That this privilege of giving or witholding  
our monies, is an important barrier againtt  
the undue exertion of prerogative, which,  
if lett altogether without controul, may be  
exercifed to our great opprefiion; and all  
hiftory fhev.s, how efficacious is its inter-  
ceffion tor redrefs of grievances, and re-efta-  
blifthi.ent of rights, and how improvident  
it would be to part with fo powerful a  
mediator,  
  
Weare of opin onthat the propofition con.  
tained in this refolu&#x27;ion, is unreafonable  
and infidious: unreafonable. becaufe, if we  
dic re we accede to it, we declere, with-  
oucr fivation we will purchate the favour  
of Parliament, not knowing at the fame time  
at what pice they will pleafe to eftimate  
their iavovr: It isinfidious, becaufe indivi  
dual colonies having bid and hidden again,  
till they find the avidity of the feller too great  
for a, their pow rs io fatisty, are then to re-  
turn into oppotition, divided from their fifter  
colonies, whom the Miniiter will have pre-  
vioufly detached by a grant of catier terms,  
or hy an artful procraftination of a defini-  
tive anfwer.

their pretended power of taxation being  
exprefsly made, commenfurate with the con-  
tinuance of our gifts, thefe muft be p-rpe-  
tual to make that fo, Whereas no experi-  
ence has fhewn that a gift of perpetual reve.  
nue fecures a perpetual return of duty or of  
kind difpofition, On the contrary, the Par.  
liament itfelf, wifely attentive to this o fer-  
vation, are in the eftablifhed pra@ice of  
granting theirfupplies from year to year only,  
  
Defirous and determined as we are to  
conficer, in the molt difpaffionate view, e-  
very feeming advance towards a reconcilia-  
tion made by the Britith Parliament, let our  
brethren of Britain refleét what would have  
been the facrifice to men of free fpirits. had  
even fair terms been proffered, as thefe infi-  
dious propofals were, with circumftances of  
infult and defiance, A propofition to give  
our money, accompanied with large fleets  
and armies, feems acdreffed to fears, rather  
than to our freedom. With what patience  
would Britons have received articles cf  
treaty from any power on earth, when borne  
on the point of a bayonet by military ple-  
nipotentiaries ?  
  
We think the attempt unneceffary to raife  
upon us by force or by threats, our propor-  
tional contributions to the common defence,  
when all know, and themfelves acknowledge  
we have fully contributed, whenever called  
upon to do foin the character of freemen.  
  
We are of opinion it is not juft that the  
colonies fhould be required to oblige them-  
felves to other contributions, while Great-  
Britain poffeffes a monopoly of their trade,  
This of itfelf lays them under heavy con-  
tribution. ‘To demand, therefore, additi-  
onal aids in the form of a tax, is to demand  
the double of their equal proportion, If  
we are to contribute equally with the other  
parts of the empire, let us equally with them  
enjoy free commerce with the whole world,  
But while the reitri€tions on our trade fhut  
to us the refources of wealth, is it juft we  
fhould bear all other burthens equally with  
thofe to whom refource is open?  
  
We conceive that the Britifh Parliament  
has no right to intermeddle with our provifions  
for the fupport of civil government, or ad-  
miniftration of juftice. The provifions we have  
made are {uch as pleafe ourfelves, and are agree-  
alle toour own circumftances: They aniwer  
the fubftantia] purpofes of government and  
of juttice, and other purpofes than thele  
fhould not be anfwered, We do not mean  
that our people fhall be burthened with op-  
preffive taxes, to provide finecures for che idle  
or the wicked, under colour of providing  
for a civil lift, While Parliament purfue their  
plan of civil Government within their own jurif-  
diftion, we alfo hope to purfue curs without  
moleftation,  
  
We are of opinion the propofition is alto-  
gether unfatisfa@tory, becaufe it imports only  
a fufpenfion of the mode, not a renunciation  
of the pretended right to tax us; becaufe

Upon the whole, this propofition feems to  
have been held up to the world, to deceive it  
into a belief that there was nothing in dif-

reafonable if not pertectly fatished : Where-  
as, in truth, our adverfaries {till claim a

he feveral aflemblies of New-Jeviey,  
Penntylvania and Virginia, having referred to  
the Congrefs a refolution, of the Houle of Com-  
mons of Great Britain, which refolution is ia  
theie words ;  
, Luna, 20 Die Feb. 1796.  
The Houle in aCommittee onthe American  
papers.  
_ Motion made, and queftion propofed, “ Thag  
it is the opinion of this Committee, that when  
the General Council and Aflembly, or General  
Court of any of his Majefty’s provinces or  
colonies in America, thall propofe to make  
  
.provifion, according to the condition, circurm-  
  
ftance, or fituation of fuch province or colony,  
for contributing their proportion to the com-  
mon defence (fuch proportion to be raifed un-  
der the authority of the Genesal Court, or  
General Affembly of fuch province or colony,  
and difpofable by Parliament), antl thall engage  
  
to make provifion alfo for the {upport of thecivil  
  
government, and the adminiftration of jultice  
in fuch province or colony; it will be proper,  
if fuch propofal thall be approved by his Ma-  
jefty and the two Houles of Parliament, and  
for fo long as fuch provifion thall be made ac-  
cordingly, to forbear, in refpec to fuch pro-  
vince or colony, to lay any duty, tax, or aflefl-  
ment, or to impofe any further duty, tax, or  
alfeiiment, except only fuch duties as it may  
be expedient to continue to levy or tmpofe for  
the regulation of commerce; the net produce  
of the duties laft mentioned to be carried to  
the account of fuch province or colony re-  
{pectively.”’ eg  
The Congrefs took the {aid refelution inte  
confideration, and are thereupon of opinion,  
THAT the colonies of America areenti-  
tled tothe fole and exclufive privilege of giv-  
ing and granting their own money: That this  
involves aright of deliberating whether they  
will make any gift, for what purpofe it thall  
be made, and what fhall be its amount-;. and  
that it is a high breach of this privilege for  
any hedy of men extraneous to their conftitu-  
tions,  
  
  
  
tions, to preferibe the purpofes for which mo-  
ney thall be levied on them, to take to them-  
felves the authority of judging of their con-  
ditions, circumftances, and fituations, and of  
determining the amount of the contribution to  
be levied. e  
  
That asthe colonics poffefs a right of ap-  
propriating their gifts, fo are they entitled at  
all times to enquire into their application, to  
fee that they be not wailed among the venal  
and corrupt for the purpole of undermining  
the civil rights of the givers, nor yet be di-  
verted to the fupport of ftanding armies, in-  
confifient with their freedom, and fubverfive  
so their quiet. ‘To propofe, therefore, as this  
refolution does, that the monies given by the  
colonies thall be fubject to the difpofal of Par-  
liament alone, is to propofe that they fhall re-  
linquifh this right of enquiring, and put it in  
the power of others to render their gifts ruin-  
cus, in proportion as they are Iliberal.  
  
That this privilege of giving or withholding  
our monies, ts an important barrier againft the  
wndue exertion of prerogative, which, if lett  
altogether without cogtrou], may be exerciled  
te our great oppreffion; and all hiftory fhews,  
how efficacious is its intermiffion for redrefs of  
grievances, and re-eftablifhment of rights, and  
how improvident ijt would be to part with fo  
powerful a mediator.  
  
We are of opinion, that the propofition con-  
tained in this refolution is unreafonable and  
wnfidious ; unreafonable, becaufe, if we declare  
we accede to it, we declare without refervation,  
we will purchafe the favour of Parliament, not  
knowing at the fame time at what price they  
will pleafe to eftimate their favour: it is inf-  
diout, beeaufe individual colonies, having bid  
and bidden again, till they find the avidity of  
the feller too great for all their powers to fatisfy,  
are then to return into oppofition, divided from  
their fifter colénies, whom the Minifter will  
have previoufly detached by a grant of eafier  
terms, or by an artful procraftination of a de-  
finitive anfwer.  
  
That the fulpenfion of the exercife of their  
pretended’ power of taxation being expreisly  
made commenfurate with the continuance of  
our gifts, thefe muft be perpetual to make that  
fo, ~-Whereas no experience has fhewn that a  
gift of perpetual revenue fecures a perpetual re-  
¢urn of duty or of kind difpofition. On the  
contrary, the Parliament itielf, wifely atten-  
tive to this obfervation, are in the eftablifhed  
practice of granting their fupplief from year  
  
to aon only.

Weare of opinion, it is not juft, that ther,  
lonies thould be required to oblige themfetery  
to other contributions, while Great-Brigis  
poffeffies a monopoly of their trade. Thi gf  
itfelf lays them under heavy contribytig,  
To demand, therefore, additional aids jp ty  
form of a tax, is todemand the double of the,  
equal proportion. If we are to contribpe  
equally with the other parts of the emp  
let us equally with them enjoy free commen  
with the whole world. But while the ref,  
tions on our trade fhut to us the refource: ¢  
wealth, is it juft we fhould bear all other by.  
thens equally with thole to whom every fp.  
lource is open ? |  
We conceive that the Britith Parliameg&#x27;  
“* has no right to intermeddle’’ with our ps,  
vifions for the fupport of civil Governmey,  
or adminiftration of juftice. ‘* The provifieg  
we have made are fuch as pleafe ourfelye,”  
and are agreeable to our own circumflance:  
they anfwer the fubftantial purpofes of gm:  
vernment and of juftice, and other purpold)  
than they fhould not be anfwered, We dom  
mean that our people fhall be burthened wig  
oppreffive taxes, to provide finecures for tt  
idle or the wicked, under colour of  providisg  
for a civil Ift. ** While Parliament pare  
the r plan of civ&#x27;] Government, within ther®  
own jurifdict’on, we alfo hope to purfue oa  
without molettation.”’ | :  
We are of opinion, the propofition is ae  
gether unfatisfactory, becaulé it imports ot  
a fuipenfion of the mode, not a renuncigtit  
of the pretended right to tax us; becaule ia  
it does not propofe to repeal the feveral Aw  
of Parliarnent paffed for the purpofes of &amp;  
ftraining the trade and altering the formd  
Government of one of our colonies ; extent  
the boundarjes and changing the Governmet  
of Quebec; enlarging thé jurifdiction of te  
Courts of Admiralty and Vice Admirihyy  
taking from us the rights ‘of trial by ms &#x27;  
the vicinage in cafes affecting both hie and  
property ; tranfporting us into other cousin  
to be tried for criminal offences; excmptiq  
by mock-trial the murderers of colonifts from

« THAT it is the opinion of this committee, that when

dient to continue to levy or impoſe for the regulation of  
commerce ; the net produce of the duties laſt mentioned  
  
to be carried to the account of ſuch province or colony  
reſpectively.“ j  
  
Tn Congreſs took the ſaid reſolution into conſi-  
deration, and are thereupon of opinion,  
  
THAT the colonies of America are entitled to the ſole  
and excluſive privilege of giving and granting their own  
money : that this involves a right of deliberating whether  
hey will make any gift, for what purpoſes it ſhall be made,&#x27;  
and what ſhall be its amount; and that it is a high breach  
of this privilege for any body of men, extraneous to their  
conſtitutions, to preſcribe the purpoſes for which mo  
ſhall be levied on them, to take to themſelves the authority  
of judging of their conditions, circumſtances and ſituations,  
  
| . 22 determining the amount of the contribution to be  
evied. | 5 *  
  
Tur as the colonies poſſeſs a right of appropriating  
their gifts, ſo are they intitled at all times to enquire into  
  
their application, to ſee that they be not waſted e  
5 &#x27; &#x27; . * f +  
  
3  
  
the venal and corrupt, for the purpoſe of undermining the  
civil rights of the givers, nor yet be diverted to the ſupport  
of ſtanding armies, inconſiſtent with their freedom and  
ſubverſive of their quiet. To propoſe therefore, as this  
reſolution does, that the monies given by the colonies ſhall  
be ſubje&amp; to the diſpoſal of parliament alone, is to propoſe  
that they ſhall relinquiſh this right of enquiry, and put it  
in the power of others to render their gifts ruinous, in  
proportion as they are liberal. | 1  
  
Tarar this privilege of giving or of with- holding our  
monies, is an important barrier againſt the undue exertion  
of prerogative, which if left altogether without controul,  
may be exerciſed to our great oppreſſion ; and all hiſtory  
ſhews how efficacious is its interceſſion for redreſs of griev-  
ances and re-eſtabliſhment of rights, and how improvident  
  
*  
  
it would be to part with ſo powerful a mediator.  
  
W are of opinion that the propoſition contained in  
  
  
becauſe if we declare we accede to it, we declare without  
reſervation we will purchaſe the favour of parliament, not  
  
  
eſtimate their favour ; it is inſidious, becauſe individual  
colonies having &#x27;bid and bidden again, till they ind the  
avidity of the ſeller too great for all their powers lo ſatisfy,  
are then to return into oppoſition, divided from their ſiſter

On its transmission to the colonies, it did not!  
produce the effects of disunion &amp;xpected from  
it. It was unanimously rejected. The reason|  
for this cannot be expressed better than jn the,  
  
  
  
said resolution into consideration, and are there-  
  
upon of opinion, fully contributed, whenever called upon to do  
of America are entitled to |  
| the sole and exclusive privilege of giving and |  
  
That this involves |  
  
** That the colonies  
  
granting theirown money.  
a right of deliberating whether they will make  
any gift, for what purpose it shall be made, and  
What shall be its amount; and that it is a high  
breach of this privilege for any body of men, ex-  
traneous to their constitutions, to prescribe the  
purposes for which money shall be levied on  
them, to take to themselves the authority of  
  
judging of their conditions, circumstances, and  
  
situations, and of determining the amount of the  
contribution to be levied.  
  
‘* That as the colonies possess a right of appro-  
priating their gifts, so are they entitled at all  
times to enquire into their application, to see  
that they be not wasted among the venal and  
corrupt for the purpose of undermining the civil  
rights of the givers, nor yet be diverted to the  
support of standing armies, inconsistent with  
their freedom and subversive of their quiet. To  
propose, therefore, as this resolution does, that  
the monies given by the colonies shall be subject  
to the disposal of parliament alone, is to propose  
that they shall relinquish this right of enquiry,  
and put it in the power of others to render their  
gifts ruinous, in proportion as they are liberal.  
  
“That this privilege of giving, or of with-  
holding our monies, is an important barrier  
against the undue exertion of prerogative, which,  
if left altogether without control, may be exer-  
cised to our great oppression; and all history  
shews how eflicacious is its intercession for re-  
dress of grievances, and  
rights, and how improvident it would be to part  
with so powerful a mediator.  
  
‘* We are of opinion that the proposition con-|  
  
tained in this resolution is unreasonable and in-  
sidious : unreasonable, because, if we declare we  
accede to it, we declare without reservation, we  
  
| will purchase the favor of parliament, not know-|  
  
ing at the same time at what price they will  
please to estimate their favor; it is insidious,  
because, individual colonies, having bid and bid-  
den again, till they find the avidity of the seller  
too great for all their powers to satisfy, are then  
  
to return into opposition, divided from their sis-|  
  
ter colonies, whom the minister will have pre-  
viously detached by a grant of easier terms, or  
  
by an artful procrastination of a definitive an-|  
  
swer.  
  
‘* That the suspension of the exercise of their  
pretended power of taxation being expressly  
made commensurate with the  
so. Whereas no experience has shewn thata  
gift of perpetual revenue secures a perpetual re-  
turn of duty or of kind dispositions. On  
contrary, the parliament itself, wisely attentive  
to this observation, are in the established prac-  
tice of granting their supplies from year to year  
only.  
  
‘‘ Desirous, and determined as we are to con-|  
  
sider, in the most dispassionate view, every  
seeming advance towards a reconciliation made  
  
by the British parliament, let our brethren of  
  
britain reflect what would have been the sacri-  
fice to men of free spirits, had even fair terms  
been proffered, as these insidious proposals were,  
with circumstances of insult and defiance. A  
proposition to give our money, accompanied  
with large fleets and armies, seems addressed to  
our fears, rather than to our freedom. With  
  
what patience would Britons have received ar-|  
  
ticles of treaty from any power on earth, when  
borne on the point of a bayonet by military plen-  
ipotentiaries !

all know, and themselves acknowledge, we have  
  
so, in the character of freemen,  
  
**We are of opinion it is not just that the col-  
onies should be required to oblige themselves to  
other contributions, while Great britain possesses  
a monopoly of their trade. This, of itself, lays  
them under heavy contribution. To demand,  
therefore, additional aids in the form of a tax, js  
jto demand the double of their equal proportion;  
jit we are to contribute equally with the othe;  
|parts of the empire, let us equally with them,  
enjoy free commerce with the whole world.—  
But while the restrictions on our trade shut to  
us the resources of wealth, is it just we should  
bear all other burthens, equally with those to  
whom every resource is open?  
  
**We conceive that the British parliament has  
no right to intermeddle with our provisions for  
the support of civil government, or administra-  
tion of justice. The provisions we have made  
are such as please ourselves, and are agreeable  
to our own circumstances: They answer the  
substantial purposes of government and of jus-  
tice, and other purposes than these should not  
be answered. We do not mean that our people  
|Shall be burthened with oppressive taxes, to pro-  
vide sinecures for the idle or the wicked, under  
color of providing for a civil list. While partia-  
ment pursue their plan of civil government  
within their own jurisdiction, we also hope to  
pursue ours without molestation.  
  
**We are of opinion the proposition is alto-  
gether unsatisfactory; because it imports only a  
isuspension of the mode, not a renunciation ot  
the pretended right to taX US: Because, too, it  
does not propose to repeal the several acts ot  
parliament, passed for the purposes of restrain-  
ing the trade, and altering the form of govern-  
‘ment of one of our colonies; extending the  
boundaries and changing the government oi  
| Quebec ; enlarging the jurisdiction of the courts  
of admiralty and vice-admiralty; taking from us  
the rights of atrial by jury of the vicinage, in  
cases affecting both life and property ; transport-  
ing us into other countries to be tried for crimi-  
jnal offences; exempting, by mock-trial, the mur-  
\derers of colonists trom punishment; and quar-  
tering soldiers on us in times of profound peace.  
| Nor do they renounce the power of suspending  
jour own legislatures, and for legislating for us  
themselves in all cases whatsoever. On the con-  
trary, to shew they mean no discontinuance o!  
injury, they pass acts, at the very time of hold-  
ing out this proposition, for restraining the com-  
|merce and fisheries of the provinces of New  
England, and for interdicting the trade of other  
colonies with all foreign nations, and with each  
other. This proves, unequivocally, they mean  
not to relinquish the exercise of indiscriminate  
legislation over us.  
| **Upon the whole, this proposition seems to  
j}have been held up to the world, to deceive 1!  
into a belief that there was nothing in dispute  
between us but the mode of levying taxes; and  
‘that the parliament having now been so good as  
to give up this, colonies are unreasonable if no!  
perfectly satisfied : whereas, in truth, our adver-  
lsaries still claim a right of demanding ad libitum,  
and of taxing us themselves to the full amount  
of their demand, if we do comply with it. This  
leaves us without any thing we can call proper-  
ity. But, what is of more importance, and what  
in this proposal they keep out of sight, as if ne  
such point was now in contest between us, they  
claim aright to alter our charters and establish  
laws, and leave us without any security for our  
lives or liberties. ‘The proposition seems also to

service of the Congress to the colonial cause was inestimable.  
The proposal is pronounced “ unreasonable and insidious.”  
  
“Unreasonable because, if we declare we accede to it, we  
declare without reservation, we will purchase the favor of parlia-  
ment, not knowing at the same time at what price they will please  
to estimate their favor; it is insidious, because individual colonies,  
having bid and bidden again, till they find the avidity of the  
seller too great for all their powers to satisfy, are then to return  
into opposition, divided from their sister colonies whom the minis-  
ter will have previously detached by a grant of easier terms, or by  
an artful procrastination of a definitive answer.”’ The opinion  
continues: “ Upon the whole, this proposition seems to have been  
held up to the world, to deceive it into a belief that there was  
nothing in dispute between us but the mode of levying taxes ; and  
that the parliament having now been so good as to give up this,
