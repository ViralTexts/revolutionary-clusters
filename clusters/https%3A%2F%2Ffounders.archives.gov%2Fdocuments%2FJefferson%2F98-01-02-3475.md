CE,AT a meeting of the Republican Members of both branches of the Legislature of the State of New-York, held at the Assembly Chamber in the city of Albany, on the 22d day of April, 1823. The Hon. WALTER BOWNE, of the Senate, was called to the Chair, and JAMES MULLETT, Jun. Esp. of the Assembly, appointed Secretary.On motion of the Lieutenant-Governor, it wasRESOLVED, That a committee be appointed by the Chair, to prepare and report resolutions expressive of the sense of this meeting, in regard to the approaching presidential election; and thereupon, the Hon. Erastus Root, the Hon. Messrs. Redfield and Dudley, of the Senate; the Hon. Peter. R. Livingston, Speaker of the Assembly, and Messrs. Gardiner, Goodell, Seaman, Birdseye, and Hager, of that body, were appointed such committee.The following resolutions, being reported by the committee, were after discussion, unanimously adopted.WHEREAS the period fixed for the election of a Chief Magistrate of the United States, has so nearly approached, that the Members of the Legislature of several of our sister States, have already thought it advisable to express their feelings upon the occasion, and have thereby rendered it proper, that those who have been elected in a similar capacity to represent the state of New York, should leave no reason for supposing, that this state is more insensible than other members of the confederacy to the importance of such a question: Therefore—RESOLVED, That we consider an explicit avowal of our sentiments in the matter, as not only called for by the occasion, but due to the commendable solicitude which is felt by our republican brethern in other parts of the Union:—That it is highly essential to the interests of those who have the happiness to live under a republican form of government, that its administration should be committed to persons, whose opinions and feelings are in coincidence with its fundamental principles, and whose lives and conduct furnish the most unequivocal evidence of their entire devotion to the preservation of those principles:—That the practice of making nominations for the office of President by individual states, has a tendency to disturb the harmony of the great republican family, by creating and strengthening individual predilections and local feelings, and thereby preventing that concert of action, which has heretofore crowned their exertions with success:—That although a nomination by the Republican Members of Congress is not entirely free from objections, yet that assembled as they are from different quarters of the Union—coming from the various classes of the community—elected during the pendency and discussion of the question, and in a great degree with reference to it, they bring into one body as perfect a representation as can be expected of the interests and wishes of all, and of each; and that a nomination made by them in the manner which has heretofore been usual, is the best attainable mode of effecting the great object in view, which has yet been suggested:—That we fully believe, that a convention thus constituted, will be less liable to be influenced by those sectional jealousies, against which the father of his country has so solemnly and justly cautioned us; more likely to cherish those purely national feelings, which it is the interest, and should be the pride  of every state to protect; and better calculated to preserve unbroken, those political ties, which bind together the Republicans of the north and of the south, the east and the west, and are consecrated by the recollection of times and events, dear to the democracy of the nation, which triumphed in the election, and prospered under the administration of the illustrious Jefferson:—That we feel an unhesitating confidence, that when the proper time for making such nomination shall arrive, the Republican Members of Congress will select as a candidate, for an office of general supervision over the great Political, Agricultural, Manufacturing and Commercial interests of the Nation, one who is not only a sound Democratic Republican in principle and practice, but who will labour with equal assiduity for the just promotion of all those great interests; and to whom the Republicans of New-York can give their willing support.RESOLVED, That the proceedings of this meeting by signed by the Chairman and Secretary, and published.

New Yorx, At a meeting of the republican  
members of both branches of the legislature of the  
state ef New York, held at the assembly chamber in  
the city of Albany, on the 22d day of April, 1823—  
the hon. Walter Bowne, of the senate, was calied  
to the chair, and James Mullett, jr. esq. of the as-  
sembly, appointed secretary. .  
  
On motioa of the lieutenant-governor, it was  
Resolved, That a committee be appointed by the  
chair, to prepare and report resolutions expressive  
of the sense of this meeting, in regard to the ap-  
proaching presidential election; and thereupon, the  
hon. Erastus Root, the hon. Messrs. Redfield and  
Dudley, of the senate; the hon. Peter R. Livingston,  
speaker of the assembly, and Messrs. Gardiner,  
Goodell, Seaman, Birdseye and Hager, of that bocy,  
were appointed such committee.  
  
The following resolutions, being reported by the  
committee, were, after discussion, unanimously  
adopted:  
  
Whereas, the period fixed for the election of a  
chief magistrate of the United States has so nearly  
approached, that the members of the legislatures of  
several of our sister states have already thought it  
advisable to express their feelings upon the occa-  
sion, and have thereby rendered it proper that  
these who have been elected, in a similar capacity,  
to represent the state of New York, should leave no  
reason for supposing that this state is more insensi-  
ble than other members of the confederacy to the  
importance of such a question: Therefore,  
  
Resotved, That we consider an explicit avowal of  
our sentiments in the matter, as not only called for  
by the occasion, but due to the commendable soli-  
citude which is felt by our republican brethren in  
other parts of the union:  
  
That it is highly essential to the interests of those  
who have the happiness to live under a republican  
form of government, that its administration should  
be committed to persons whose opinions and feel-  
ings are in coincidence with its fundamental prin-  
ciples, and whose lives and conduct furnish the most  
unequivocal evidence of their entire devotion to  
the preservation of those principles:  
  
That, the practice of making nominations for the  
office of president by individual states, has a ten-  
dency to disturb the harmony of the great republi-  
can family, by creating and strengthening individual  
predilections and local feelings, and thereby pre-  
venting that concert of action which has heretofore  
crowned their exertions with success:  
  
That although a nomination by the republican  
members of congress is not entirely free from ob-  
jections, yet that, assembled as they are from the  
different quarters of the union; coming from the  
various Classes of the community; elected during  
the pendency and discussion of the question, and,  
in a great degree, with reference to it; they bring  
into one body as perfect a representation as can be  
expected of the interests and whishes of all and of  
each; and that a nomination made by them in the  
manner which has heretofore been usual, is the best  
attainable mode of effecting the great object in view,  
which has yet been suggested

preserve unbroken those political ties which bind  
together the republicans of the north and of the  
south, the east and the west, and are consecrated  
by the recollections of times and events dear to the  
  
lemocracy of the nation, which triumphed in the  
election, and prospered under the administration of  
the illustrious Jefferson: |  
  
That we feel an unhesitating confidence, that,  
when the proper time for making such nommation  
shall arrive, the republican members of congress  
will select as a candidate, for an office of general  
supervision over the great political, agricultural,

publican in principle and practice, but who will la  
bor with equal assiduity for the just promotion of  
allthose great interests; and to whom the republi-  
cans of New York can give their willing support.

That we fully believe that a convention, thus

At a meeting ot the Republican Members  
of both branches of (he Legislature ot  
tbe state of New York, held a&#x27; (he As­  
sembly Chamber in (he city ot Albany,  
oo the 22d d?y of Apri; 1823 The  
Hon Walter Bowne,ol the Senate, was  
called to the Chair, and James M&#x27;sJlett,  
Jun. Esq of the Asslembly, appointed  
Secretary.  
On motion of the Lieutenant Governor,  
it was resolved, That a committee he ap­  
pointed by tbe Chair, to prepare and re  
port resolutions expressive of tbe sonse of  
this meeting, in regard to the approaching  
Eresidential election; and thereupon, tbe

prevent tbe concert of action* which has  
hitherto crowned (heir exertions with sue *

That although a nomination by the Re­

That we fully believe, that a conven­
