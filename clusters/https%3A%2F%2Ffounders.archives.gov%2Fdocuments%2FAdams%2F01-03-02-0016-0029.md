 on the 15th of May 1776 it passed. It was indeed on all hands considered by Men of Understanding as equivalent to a declaration of Independence: tho a formal declaration of it was still opposed by Mr. Dickinson and his Party.  
Not long after this the three greatest Measures of all, were carried. Three Committees were appointed, One for preparing a Declaration of Independence, another for reporting a Plan of a Treaty to be proposed to France, and a third to digest a System of Articles of Confederation to be proposed to the States.—I was appointed on the Committee of Independence, and on that for preparing the form of a Treaty with France: on the Committee of Confederation Mr. Samuel Adams was appointed. The Committee of Independence, were Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman and Robert R. Livingston. Mr. Jefferson had been now about a Year a Member of Congress, but had attended his Duty in the House but a very small part of the time and when there had never spoken in public: and during the whole Time I satt with him in Congress, I never heard him utter three Sentences together. The most of a Speech he ever made in my hearing was a gross insult on Religion, in one or two Sentences, for which I gave him immediately the Reprehension, which he richly merited. It will naturally be enquired, how it happened that he was appointed on a Committee of such importance. There were more reasons than one. Mr. Jefferson had the Reputation of a masterly Pen. He had been chosen a Delegate in Virginia, in consequence of a very handsome public Paper which he had written for the House of Burgesses, which had given him the Character of a fine Writer. Another reason was that Mr. Richard Henry Lee was not beloved by the most of his Colleagues from Virginia and Mr. Jefferson was sett up to rival and supplant him. This could be done only by the Pen, for Mr. Jefferson could stand no competition with him or any one else in Elocution and public debate. Here I will interrupt the narration for a moment to observe that from all I have read of the History of Greece and Rome, England and France, and all I have observed at home, and abroad, that Eloquence in public Assemblies is not the surest road, to Fame and Preferment, at least unless it be used with great caution, very rarely, and with great Reserve. The Examples of Washington, Franklin and Jefferson are enough to shew that Silence and reserve in public are more Efficacious than Argumentation or Oratory. A public Speaker who inserts himself, or is urged by others into the Conduct of Affairs, by daily Exertions to justify his measures, and answer the Objections of Opponents, makes himself too familiar with the public, and unavoidably makes himself Ennemies. Few Persons can bare to be outdone in Reasoning or declamation or Wit, or Sarcasm or Repartee, or Satyr, and all these things are very apt to grow out of public debate. In this Way in a Course of Years, a Nation becomes full of a Mans Ennemies, or at least of such as have been galled in some Controversy, and take a secret pleasure in assisting to humble and mortify him. So much for this digression. We will now return to our Memoirs. The Committee had several meetings, in which were proposed the Articles of which the Declaration was to consist, and minutes made of them. The Committee then appointed Mr. Jefferson and me, to draw them up in form, and cloath them in a proper Dress. The Sub Committee met, and considered the Minutes, making such Observations on them as then occurred: when Mr. Jefferson desired me to take them to my Lodgings and make the Draught. This I declined and gave several reasons for declining. 1. That he was a Virginian and I a Massachusettensian. 2. that he was a southern Man and I a northern one. 3. That I had been so obnoxious for my early and constant Zeal in promoting the Measure, that any draught of mine, would undergo a more severe Scrutiny and Criticism in Congress, than one of his composition. 4thly and lastly and that would be reason enough if there were no other, I had a great Opinion of the Elegance of his pen and none at all of my own. I therefore insisted that no hesitation should be made on his part. He accordingly took the Minutes and in a day or two produced to me his Draught. Whether I made or suggested any corrections I remember not. The Report was made to the Committee of five, by them examined, but whether altered or corrected in any thing I cannot recollect. But in substance at least it was reported to Congress where, after a severe Criticism, and striking out several of the most oratorical Paragraphs it was adopted on the fourth of July 1776, and published to the World

are jointly bound.  
The admission contained in this statement  
from the diary of Aiiams, is complete ; and his  
reasons for declining the honor, and giving the  
preference to Jn i i:km?, are highly creditable  
to his patriotism, and contrast strikingly with

was set up to rival and supplant him. This  
could be done only by the pen, for Mr. Jefferson  
could stand no competition with him, or any one  
else, in elocution and public debate.  
Here 1 will interrupt the narration for a moment,  
to observe that, from all I have read of  
the history of Greece and Rome, England and  
France, and all I have observed at home and  
abroud, eloquence in public assemblies is not the  
surest roail to fame or preferment, at least, unless

great reserve. The examples of Washington,

apt to grow out of public debate. In this way,

Declaration of Independence.  
[In his autobiography, John Adams gives the  
following account of the circumstances which  
led to the selection of Jefferson to draw the  
the Declaration of Independence.]  
The Committee of Independence were Thom­  
as Jefferson, John Adams, Beniamin branklin,  
Roger Sherman, and Robert K. Livingston.—  
Mr. Jefferson had been now about a year a  
member of Congress, but had attended his du­  
ty in the House a very small part of the time,  
and when there, had never spoken in public.—  
During the whole time l sat with him in Con­  
gress, l never heard hon utter three sentences to­  
gether  
  
ii win naiurany ne inquired now 11 nap­  
peneri that he was appointed on a committee of  
such importance. There were more reasons  
than one. Mr. Jefferson had the reputation of a  
masterly pen; he had been chosen a Delegate in  
Virginia in consequence ot a very handsome  
public paper which he had written for the  
House of Burgesses, which had given him the  
character of a fine writer. Another reason was,  
that Mr. Richard Henfv Lee was not beloved  
by the most of his colleagues from Virginia,  
and Mr. Jefferson wa* set up to rival and sup­  
plant him. This could be done only by the  
pen, for Mr. Jefferson could stand no competi­  
tion with him, or any one else in elocution and  
public debate.  
Here, I will interrupt the narration for a mo­  
ment, to observe that from all I h tve read of  
the history of Greece and Rome, England and  
France, and all f have observed at home and  
abroad, eloquence in public assemblies is not the

less it be used with caution, very rarely, and  
with great reserve. The examples of Wash­

Declaration of Independent°.   
(In his autobiographv,John Adams gives   
the following account of the circumstances   
which led to the s6ltellon of Jefferson to   
draw the- Declaration of. Independence,) _   
The Committee of. Independence were.   
Thos.&#x27; Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin   
I.4rankfin,- Roger Sherman, and Robert R.   
Liiiingston.--Wr. Jefferson had been now   
&amp;int(&#x27; a year a member of Congress, bu t   
hrid attended to his duty in the House a very   
gmall part of the time, and when there had   
never spoken in public. -During the whole   
time I sat with him in Congress I never   
heard him utter three sentences together.   
It will naturally be inquired how it hap­  
pened that he was appointed.on a committee   
of such importance. There were more rea-  
Son than one. Mr. Jeffiwon laid the repu­  
tation of a masterly pent he had beep chosen   
a delegate in Virginia, in consequence of a   
ery-handstime-public-paper-which-he—had   
ivritten for the House of Burgesses, which   
had given hire the character of a fine wri­  
ter. Another reason was that Mr. Rich­  
fird Henry Lee itras not beloved by the most   
a his Colleagues from Virginia, and Mr.   
Jefreson was set up to rival and supplant   
him. This could be done only by the pen.   
for Mr Jefferson :could stand &#x27;no competi­  
tion with him, or any one else in elocution   
and public debate.   
Here I will interrupt the narration for a   
moment, to observe, that, from ail I have   
read of the history of Greec.! and Rome.   
England and France, and all I have observ­  
ed at home anti abroad, elt,quence in pub­  
lic assemblies is not the surest road to pre­  
ferment. at least, unless it he used with cau­  
tion, very rarely and with great reserve.   
The examples of Washington, Franklin,   
and Jefferson, are enough to show that si­  
lence and reserve in public. are more effi­  
cacious than argumentation or oratory. A   
inibliCsqieaker who exerts himself el. is urg­  
ed by others, into the conduct of of by   
daily exertions to jul-tify his measure, anti   
answer the objt,ctions of opponents makes   
.himself too familiar with the public, and   
unavoidably-makes hi.nsellenemies.   
Few persons can bear to be outdone in   
reasoning, or declamat ion. or wit or sarcasm   
or repartee, or satire, and all these things   
are very apt to grow out of public debate.   
In this way, in a coo rle of years n nation   
becomes full of a mans enemies, or at least   
of such as have been galled in some contro­  
versy, and take a secret pleasure in assis­  
ting to humble and. mortify him; So much   
fi,r this digression. We will now return to   
our memoirs.   
  
The committee lind several meetings, in   
which were proposed the articles of which   
the declaration was to consist, and minutes   
made of them. The committee then appoin­  
ted :%Ir..Tefferson and myself to draw them   
up in form, and clothe them in n proper   
dress. :The sub-committee met, and con•   
sidered the minute&#x27;s, makit4Y, such observa­  
tions on them as then occurred, when Mr.   
Jefferson desired me to take them to my   
lodging, (and make the draft. This I de­  
clined and gave several reasons for decli­  
ning. .   
I. That he was a Virginian, and I a   
Nlassachusettsian. 2. That he was a south­  
ern man and I a northern one. :3. That I   
had been so obnoxious fur my early and   
constant zeal in promoting the measure, that   
every draft of mine would undergo a inure   
severe scrutiny rind criticism &#x27;in Congress,   
than one of his composition. 4. And lastly   
and that would be reason enough, if there   
were no other, I had a great opinion of the   
elegance of his pen, and none at all of my   
own. I therefore insisted that no hesitation   
should be made on his part. Ile accord­  
ingly took the minutes, and in a yor two   
produced to me his draft. Wh ter I made   
or suggested any correction *I remember   
not. The report was made to the commit­  
tee of five, by them examined, but whether   
:altered or corrected in any tidier*, I cannot   
,recollect. But, in substance, at least, it was   
&#x27;reported to, Congress, where, after a severe   
criticism, and striking out several of the   
most oratorical paragraphs, it was adopted   
on the 4th of July, 1776, and published to

Declaration of Independence. i  
From the Diary of John Adams.  
The committee of Independence : were  
Thosl &#x27; Jefferson,&quot; John Adams, Benjamin  
rranklin, lioger bherman, and Robert R.  
Livingston. Mr. Jefferson had - been&#x27; now  
about a year a member of Congress, but had  
attended his dutj in tho House a .very small  
part of the time, and when there, had never  
spoken m public. During-the whole tunc  
I sat with him in Congress,&#x27; I.-never -.heard  
him titter three sentences together. .-;;-:  
It will naturally, be .inquired how it hap  
pened that he was appointed on a committee  
of such -importance. There were more rea  
sons than one. -Mr. Jefferson had the rep  
utation of a masterly pen ; he had been cho  
sen a delegate .m-Virginia, in consequence  
of a very handsome public paper which he  
had-written for the House of Burgesses,  
which had given him the character of a fine  
writer. Another reason was,- th at Mr. Rich  
ard Henry- Lee was not beloved by the most  
ot his colleagues Irom Virginia, and Mr.  
Jefferson was set tip to rival and&#x27; supplant  
him. lhis could le done - only by&quot; the pen.  
tor 31 r. Jefferson could stand no competition  
... r a.&#x27; A &#x27;  
witlr him, or, any one else, in elocution and  
public debate. ,  
Here I will interrupt the narration for a  
moment, to observe . that, from all I have  
read of the &#x27; history of (! recce and lom  
England and France, and all I have observed  
at home&#x27; and-abroad eloquence Tn public as­  
semblies -.is- not the &#x27;surest road to fame or  
preferment, at least, unless ifc. be used with  
caution, very Rarely and. with&#x27; great reserve.  
The examples of Washington, Franklin.&#x27;and  
Jefferson,&#x27;&#x27; arc- enough t -;nhow that silence  
and reserve in public, &quot;are more. efficacious  
than argumentation .or . oratory. A public  
speaker who,, inserts hmisen,-or is urged by  
others into &quot;the &quot;conduct of affairs. bv daily  
exertions tojustiiy nw measures, ana answer  
the objections of- opponents, makes himself  
too familiar with&#x27; the&#x27; public, and&#x27; unavoida

Few persons can &quot; bear to be outdone in

Draft of the Declaration of Indepon­  
dence.  
In his autobiography, John Adams gives the  
following account of the circumstances which led  
to the selection of Jefferson to draw the Declars­  
tion of Independence.  
The Committee of Independence were Thomas  
Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger  
Sherman and Robert R. Livingston. Mr. Jefferson  
had been now about a year a member of Congress,  
but had attended his duty in the House a very  
small part of the time, and when there had never  
spoken in public. During the whole time I sat  
with him in Congress I never heard him utter  
three sentences together.  
It will naturally be inquired how it happened  
that he was sppointed on a committee of such im­  
portance. There were more reasons than one.  
Mr. Jefferson had the reputation of a masterly  
pen; he had been chosen a delegate in Virginia,  
in consequence of a very handsome public paper  
which he had written for the House of Burgesses,  
which had given him the character of a fine writer.  
Another reason was, that Mr. Richard Henry Lee  
not beloved by the most of his colleagues from  
Virginia, and Mr. Jefferson was set up to rival and  
supplant him. This could be done only by the  
pen, for Mr. Jefferson could stand no competition  
with him, or any one else, in elocution and public  
debate.  
Here I will interrupt the narration for a moment,  
to observe, that, from all I have read of the history  
of Greece and Rome, England and France, and all  
I have observed at home and abroad, eloquence in  
public assemblies is not the surest road to fame or  
preferment, at least, unless it be used with cau­  
ion, very rarely, and with great reserve. The ex­  
imples of Washington, Franklin, and Jefferson,  
are enough to show that silence and reserve in  
public, are more efficacious than argumentation or  
oratory. A public speaker who inserts himself, or  
urged by others, into the conduct of affairs, by  
daily exertions to justify his measures, and answer  
the objections of opponents, makes himself too  
familiar with the public, and unavoidably makes  
himself enemies.  
Few persons can bear to be outdone in reasoning,  
or declamation, or wit, or sarcasm, or repartee, or  
satire, and all these things are very apt to grow out  
of public debate. In this way, in a course of  
years, a nation becomes full of a man&#x27;s enemies,  
or at least, of such as have been galled in some  
controversy, and take a secret pleasure in assisting  
to humble and mortify him. So much for this  
digression. We will now return to our memoirs.  
he committee had several meetings, in which  
were proposed the articles of which the declaration  
was to consist, and minutes made of them. The  
committee then appointed Mr. Jefferson and me to  
draw them up in form, and clothe them in a proper  
dress. The sub-committee met, and considered  
the minutes, making such observations on them as  
then occurred, when Mr. Jefferson desired me to  
take them to my lodging, and make the draught.  
This I declined, and gave several reasons for de­  
clining.  
1. That he was a Virginian, and I a Masacht­  
settensian. 2. That he was a southern man, and  
I a northern one. 3. That I had been so obno­  
ious for my early and constant zeal in promoting  
the measure, that every draught of mine would  
undergo a more severe scrutiny and criticism in  
Congress, than one of his composition. 4. And  
lastly, and that would be reason enough, if there  
were no other, I had a great opinion of the ele­  
gance of his pen, and none at all of my own. I  
therefore insisted that no hesitation should be made  
on his part. He accordingly took the minutes, and  
in a day or two produced to me his draught. Whether  
I made or suggested any correction, I remember  
not. The report was made to the committee of five,  
by them examined, but whether altered or correct­  
ed in any thing, I cannot recollect. But, in sub  
stance, at least, it was reported to Congress, where,  
after a severe criticism, and striking out several of  
the most oratorical paragraphs, it was adopted on  
the fourth of July, 1776, and published to the

the following account of the circumstances  
which led to the selee tion of Jefferson to  
draw the Declaration of Independenne:  
The committee of independence were  
Thomas lefferson, John Adams, Benjamin  
Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert i.  
Livingston. Mr. Jfferson had been now  
about a year a member of Congress, but had  
attended to his duty in the House a very small  
part of the time, and when there had never  
spoken in public. During the whole time I  
sat with him in Congress, I never heard him  
utter three sentences together. It  
urally be inquired how it happened that he  
was appointed on a committee of such impor­  
tance. There are more reasons than one.  
Mr Jeffer son had the reputation of a master-  
ly pen; he had been chosen a delegate in Vir­  
th consacuance of very handsome pub  
lic paper which he had written for the House  
weaes thiol had given him the char-  
of Burgesses, whieit liass&quot;  
acter of a fine writer. Another reason was,  
that Mr. Richard Henry Lee was not beloved  
by tho most of his colleagues from Virginla,  
and Mr. Jefferson was set up to rival and  
supplant him. This could be done only by  
the pen, for Mr. Jefferson could stand no  
competition with him, or any one else, in  
elocution and public debate.  
Here I will interrupt the narration for a  
moment, to observe that, from all I have read  
the history of Greece and Rome, England  
and France, and all I have observed at home  
e thrad alecuence in public assemblies  
and shroad, eloquence in public  
is not the surest road to fame or preferment,  
at least unless it be used with cantion, very  
rarely, and with great reserve. The exam­  
ples of Washington; Franklin, and Jefferson,  
are enough to show that silence and reserve  
in public are more efficacious than argumen­  
tation or oratory. A publie speaker who  
of affairs, by daily  
measures, and answe  
inserts himself, or is urged by others, thee  
CeI tioll tts  
justify his measures, and answer the oujes,  
 o e ekas himeelf too familiar  
tion of oppoents, manes  
with the public, and unavo&#x27;dably makes  
himself enemies. Few persons can bear to  
be outdone in reasoning, or declamation, or  
satire, and all these things are very apt to  
w out of public debate. In this way, in  
a course of years, a nation becomes full of  
man&#x27;s enemies, or at least of such as have  
been galled in some controversy, and take a  
secret pleasure in assisting to humble and  
mortify him. So much for this disgression.  
We will now return to our memories-  
The committee had several meetings, in  
which were proposed the articles of which  
the Declaration was to consist, and minutes  
made of them. The committee then appoin­  
ted Mr. Jesferson and me to draw them up  
in form, and clothe them in a proper dress.  
The sub-committee met and considered the  
minutes, making such observations on them  
as theh oelt  o ed  
then oocurred when Mr Jefferson de  
sired me to take them to my lodging an  
make the draught. This I declined, and  
gave several reasons for declining, 1st.  
That he was a Virginian, and I a Massachu­  
settensian. 2d. That he was a southern  
man, and I a northern one. 3d. That I had  
been so obnoxious for my early and constant  
zeal in promoting the measure, that every  
draft of mine would undergo a more severe  
scrutiny and criticism in Congress than one  
of his composition. 4th, And lastly, and that  
would be reason enough if there were no  
other, I had a great opinion of the elegance  
of his pen, and none at all of my own. I  
therefore insisted that no hesitation should  
be made on his part. He accordingly took  
the minutes, and in a day or two produced  
to me his draft. Whether I made or ang­  
gested any corection, I remember not. The  
report was made to the committee of five, by  
them examined, but whether altered or cor­  
rected in anything I cannot recollect. But  
in substange, at least, it was reported to  
Congress, where, after a severe criticism,  
and striking out several of the most orator­  
ical paragraphs, was adopted on the fourth of  
July, 1776, and published to the world

EFrECT OF TOO MUCH SPEAEING. We  
find the following remarks in the autobiog­  
 raphy of John Adams, which we commend  
 to our public men who are so frequently in  
the habit of speech-making:  
From all I have read of the history of  
Greece and Rome, England and France.  
and all I have observed at home and abroad,  
eloquence in public assemblies is not the  
surest road to fame and preferment, at least  
unless it be used with caution, very rarely.  
and with great reserve. The examples of  
Washingion, Feanklin and lefferon, ar  
enough to show that  silence and reserve in  
 public are more efficacious than argument:­  
tion or oratory. A public speaker who in­  
 serts himself, or is urged by others, into the  
conduct of affairs, by daily exertions to jus-  
tify his measures, and answer the objection­  
 of opponents, makes himself too familiar  
with the public, and unavoidably makes  
 himself enemies. Few persons can bear to  
be outdone in rasoning or declamation in  
wit, or sarcasm or repartee or satire, and  
all these things are very apt to grow out of  
 public debate. In this way, in the course  
of years, a nation becomes full of a man&#x27;s  
enemies, or at least, of such as have been  
galled in some controversy, and take a seeret  
pleasure in assisting to humble and mortify  
him.

of Independence. The members were  
J efferson, John Adams, Franklin, Sherman  
and &quot;Robert R. Livingston.  
In regard to the preparation of the pa­  
per, Adams gives the following interesting  
account: &quot;Mr. Jefferson had been now  
about a year a member of Congress, but  
had attended to his duty in the House a  
Very small part of his time ; and when  
there he had never spoken in public. Du­  
ring the whole time I sat with him in  
Congress, I never heard him utter three  
sentences together.  
&quot;It will naturally be inquired, how it  
happened that he was appointed on a com­  
mittee of such importance ? There were  
more reasons than one. Mr. Jefferson had  
the reputation of a masterly pen ; he had  
been chosen delegate lrom Virginia in  
consequence of a very handsome paper,  
which he had written for the House of  
Burgesses, which had given him the char­  
acter of. a fine writer. Another reason  
was, that Mr. 11. H. Lee was not beloved  
by most of his colleagues from Virginia,  
and Mr. Jefferson was sent up to rival and.  
supplant him. This could be doue only  
by the pen, for Mr. Jefferson cculd stand  
no competition with him, or any one else,  
in elocution or public debate. The com­  
mittee had several meetings, in which vere  
proposed the articles of which the Decla­  
ration was to consist, and minutes made of  
them. The committee then appointed Mr.  
Jefferson and me to draw them up in form,  
and clothe them in a proper dress. The  
sub-committee met and considered the  
minutes, making such observations on  
them as then occurred, when Mr. Jefferson  
desired me to take them to my lodgings  
and make a draft of them. This I de­  
clined, and gave several reasons for doing  
so.  
&quot;1st. That he was a Virginian, and I a  
Massachusettsian. 2d. That he was a  
Southern man, and I a Northern one. 3d.  
That I had been so obnoxious for my early  
and constant zeal in the measure, that any  
draft of mine would undergo a more severe  
scrutiny and criticism in Congress than  
one of his composition. 4th. And lastly  
(and that would be reason enough if there  
were no other,) I had a great opinion of  
the elegance of his pen, and none at all of  
my own. I therefore insisted that no hes­  
itation should be made on his part. He  
accordingly took the minutest and in a day  
or two produced to me the draft.

On the evening of the roth he received word by  
express that his wife was very ill, and he was  
compelled to ask leave of absence for a short time.  
It was granted, and on the morning of the 11th,  
the day when the committee was appointed, he  
set off for his home in Virginia. Thomas Jefferson,  
a delegate from the same province, was first named  
on the committee, and became its chairman.  
  
Mr. Jefferson’s colleagues on that committee  
were John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger  
Sherman and Robert R. Livingston. After a full  
discussion of the topics to be embodied in the  
declaration, the writing of the document was  
entrusted to Mr. Jefferson. ‘‘ It will naturally be  
inquired,’’ Mr. Adams wrote, ‘‘ how it happened  
that he was appointed on a committee of such  
importance. There were more reasons than one.  
  
Mr. Jefferson had the reputation of a masterly  
pen; he had been chosen a delegate in Virginia in  
consequence of a very ‘handsome public paper  
  
which he had written for the House of Burgesses,  
which had given him the character of a fine writer.  
Another reason was, that Mr. Richard Henry Lee  
was not beloved by the most of his colleagues  
from Virginia, and Mr. Jefferson was sent up to  
rival and supplant him. This could be done only  
with the pen, for Mr. Jefferson could stand no  
competition with him, or any one else, in elocution  
or public debate.’’ He had then been a membe

son at bis lodgings, southwest corner of  
Beventh and High streets, Philadelphia, and  
was amended in a few particulars by  
Adams and Franklin, and submitted to  
Congress July Ist.  
Mr. Adams says that at the first meeting  
of the committee Mr. Jefferson and himself  
were appointed the sub-aommHtee, and Mr.  
Jefferson proposed to bim to make the  
draft. “This 1 declined and for several  
reason?: 1. That he was a Virginian and I  
a Massachusettseuian. 2. That he was a  
Southern man and Ia Northern one. 3.  
That I had been so obnoxious in my early  
and constant zeal in this behalf, that any  
draft of mine would undergo more severe  
scrutiny and criticism in Congress than one  
of his composition. 4. And lastly, and that
