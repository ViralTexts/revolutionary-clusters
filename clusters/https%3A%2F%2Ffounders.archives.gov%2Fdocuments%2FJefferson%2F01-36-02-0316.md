so ordained that there should be a court appointed, to consist of three judges, who should have a common law jurisdiction and reside in the district, and, expressly, that Congress should appoint the Governor, the Secretary, and all military general officers. In the 12th paragraph of the ordinance, it is said the Governor, judges, legeslative council secretary and such other officers as Congress shall appoint, in the district, shall take an oath &amp;c—In the direction for taking the oath of office there is a strong implication of the right of Congress or, rather, of the President to appoint these three

fore named, I am inclined to think the Governor is justified by the ordinance in his appointment of all other judges &amp; officers—  
It is provided, by the 7th paragraph of the ordinance that the Governor, previous to the organization of the General assembly, shall appoint such majestrates, and other civil officers in each County and township as he shall find necessary for the preservation of the peace, and good order in the same; and that after the general assembly shall be organized, the powers and duties of majestrates, and other civil officers, shall be regulated and defined by the assembly. After the formation of the general assembly, they, are to determine what powers &amp; duties are necessary to be exercised in existing counties

y having done this, the Governor is to make the appointments. The Provision in this paragraph appears to me to amount to this, that before the general assembly was organized the Govr. was to appoint such officers as he might judge to be necessary, afterwards, such as the legislature should judge to be necessary.—  
The 8th paragraph of the ordinance provides, that for the prevention of crimes, the laws to be adopted or made shall have force in all parts of the district. And for the execution of processes civil and criminal, that the Governor shall make proper divisions, and from time to time, as circumstances should require, lay out such parts of the district, in which the indian title shall have been extinguished, into Counties and townships, subject however to such alterations as may, thereafter, be made by the legislature. The Authority which the ordinance gives to the legislature is, in general terms, to make laws in all cases for the good government of the district, not repugnant to the principles and articles of the ordinance.  
The laying out of Counties and towns are usually considered as legislative acts, and in the present instances must be considered as appertaining to the legislature, unless, by a proper construction of the ordinance, it is secured to the Governor—It being once confessedly vested in h

gislature to alter such townships and counties as shall have been laid out. On the idea, of the authority to lay out Counties, being vested in the Governor, after the formation of a legislature, this was necessary, otherwise not.  
The ordinance provides, that, in case of the death or removal from office of a representative, the Governor shall issue a writ to the County or township for which he was a member, to elect another in his stead. I perceive no question on the Governor’s transactions respecting the election of representatives, as returned by the secretary, excepting in reference to Meigs, who is said to have left the territory—If he had not resigned, previous to the issuing of the writ for the election of a representative in his stead, I
