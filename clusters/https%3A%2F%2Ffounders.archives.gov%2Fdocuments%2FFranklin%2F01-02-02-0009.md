“To preach Christ is universally allowed to be the Duty of every christian Minister, but what does that mean? ’Tis not to use his Name as a Charm, to work up the Hearers to a warm Pitch of Enthusiasm, without any Foundation in Reason to support it: ’Tis not to make his Person or his Offices incomprehensible: ’Tis not to exalt his Glory as a kind condescending Saviour, to the Dishonour of the unlimited Goodness of the Creator and Father of the Universe, who is represented as stern and inexorable, expressing no Indulgence to his guilty Creatures, but demanding full and rigorous Satisfaction for their Offences: ’Tis not to encourage undue and presumptuous Reliances on his Merits and Satisfaction to the Contempt of Virtue and Good Works. No, but to represent him as a Law-giver as well as a Saviour, as a Preacher of Righteousness, as one who hath given us the most noble and compleat System of Morals inforced by the most substantial and worthy Motives; and shows that the whole Scheme of our Redemption is a Doctrine according to Godliness.”  
Mr. Hemphill is here preaching against the Antinomians, who hold, that Christ’s Merits and Satisfaction will save us, without our performing Good Works, which they say are unnecessary, and some of them

ond comparison the most useful Method of Preaching. And because the whole would not have answered their Ends, they have omitted the explaining part which immediately followed, viz. in this I include the enforceing the Rules of Virtue by all the peculiar Motives which the christian Religion suggests, making all its Doctrines subservient to Holiness. Which I say is the End and Design of the christian Scheme, for Christ gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar People zealous of Good-Works. And there is scarcely a Chapter in the whole Gospels or Epistles from which this Doctrine can’t be prov’d. And the next Extract they produce, viz: God hath no Regard to any thing but Mens inward Merit and Desert, is in my humble Opinion as little to the purpose as the other. I would ask these reverend Gentlemen, Does God regard Man at all? The Answer I suppose will be, That he does, but that it is upon the Account of Christ’s Merits; which I shall grant them, and allow it to be the Merits and Satisfaction of Christ that purchased such easy and plain Conditions of Happiness; but still it is our Compliance with these Conditions that I call inward Merit and Desert which God regards in us. For to say that God regards Men for any thing else besides Goodness and Virtue, is such a Notion as makes all Men both virtuous and vicious capable of being equally regarded by him, and consequently there is no Differe

We have stated only a few, and  
them with brevity, of what we name  
the evangelical principles of our  
church. That they are few, is owing  
to their being so far sufficient, as that  
they cannot consistently be held in al-  
liance with any opinion, dissonant  
from the truth, that salvation is of  
  
race. Our brevity is owing to the  
Sastre which we entertain, of noticing  
principally the result of the principle  
on our ecclesiastical concerns: the  
existence of the principle being consi-  
dered as a matter hardly liable to be  
denied or doubted of.
