Opinions and Conjectures concerning the Properties and Effects of the Electrical Matter, arising from Experiments and Observations made in Philadelphia, 1749.  
§1. The Electrical Matter consists of Particles extreamly subtile, since it can permeate common Matter, even the densest Mettals, with such Ease and Freedom, as not to receive any perceptible Resistance.  
§2. If any one should doubt, whether the Electrical Matter passes thro’ the Substance of Bodies, or only over and along their Surfaces, a Shock from an electrified large Glass Jar, taken thro’ his own Body, will probably convince him.  
3. Electrical Matter differs from common Matter in this, That the Parts of the latter mutually attract, those of the former mutually repel each other: Hence the appearing Divergency in a Stream of Electrical Effluvia.  
  
*See Mr. Ellicots ingenious Essay on Electricity in the Transactions.  
  
  
4. But tho’ the Particles of Electrical Matter do repel each other, they are strongly attracted by all other Matter.  
5. From these three Things, the extream Subtilty of the Electrical Matter, the mutual Repulsion of it’s Parts, and the strong Attraction between them and other Matter, arises this Effect; That when a Quantity of Electrical Matter is apply’d to a Mass of common Matter, of any Bigness or Length within our Observation, which has not already got it’s Quantity; it is immediately and equally diffused thro’ the whole.  
6. Thus common Matter is a Kind of a Spunge to the Electrical Fluid. And as a Spunge would receive no Water, if the Parts of Water were not smaller than the Pores of the Spunge; and even then but slowly, if there were not a mutual Attraction between those Parts, and the Parts of the Spunge; and would still imbibe it faster, if the mutual Attraction among the Parts of the Water did not impede, some Force being required to separate them: and fastest, if instead of Attraction there were a mutual Repulsion among those Parts, which would act in Conjunction with the Attraction of the Spunge: So is the Case between the Electrical and common Matter.  
7. But in common Matter there is (generally) as much of this Electrical as it will contain within it’s Substance. If more is added, it lies without, upon the Surface, and forms what we call an Electrical Atmosphere: and then the Body is said to be electrified.  
8. Tis supposed, That all Kinds of common Matter do not attract and retain the Electrical with equal Strength and Force, for Reasons to be given hereafter;  
  
†§22.  
  
and that those called Electrics per se, as Glass &amp;c. attract and retain it strongest, and contain the greatest Quantity.  
9. We know that the Electrical Fluid is in common Matter, because we can pump it out, by the Globe or Tube. We know that common Matter has near as much as it can contain; because when we add a little more to any Portion of it, the additional Quantity does not enter, but forms an electrical Atmosphere: And we know that common Matter has not (generally) more than it can contain; otherwise all loose Portions of it would repel each other, as they constantly do, when they have electrical Atmospheres.  
10. The beneficial Uses of this Electrical Fluid we are not yet well acquainted with; tho’ doubtless such there are and great ones; but we may see some pernicious Consequences that would attend a much greater Proportion of it. For had this Globe we live on, as much of it in Proportion, as we can give to a Globe of Iron, Wood, or the like, the Particles of dust and other light Matters, that get loose from it, would, by Vertue of their separate electrical Atmospheres, not only repel each other, but be repelled from the Earth, and not easily be brought to unite with it again. Whence our Air would continually be more and more clogg’d with foreign Matters, and grow unfit for Respiration. This affords another Occasion of adoring that Wisdom which has made all Things by Weight and Measure!  
11. If a Piece of common Matter be supposed intirely free from Electrical Matter, and a single Particle of the latter be brought nigh, ’twill be attracted and enter the Body, and take Place in the Center, or where the Attraction is every way equal. If more Particles enter, they take their Places where the Ballance is equal between the Attraction of the common Matter and their own mutual Repulsion. ’Tis suppos’d they form Triangles, whose Sides shorten as the Number increases; till the common Matter has drawn in so many, that it’s whole Power of compressing those Triangles by Attraction is equal to their whole Power of expanding themselves by Repulsion. Then will such Piece of Matter receive no more.  
12. When Part of this natural Proportion of Electrical Fluid is taken out of a Piece of common Matter, the Triangles form’d by the Remainder are supposed to widen by the Mutual Repulsion of the Parts, until they occupy the whole Piece.  
13. When the Quantity of Electrical Fluid, taken from a Piece of common Matter, is restored to it again, it enters; the expanded Triangles being again comprest, till there is Room for the whole.  
14. To explain this, Take two Apples or two Balls of Wood or other Matter A, B, each having its own natural Quantity of the Electrical Fluid. Suspend them by Silk Strings from the Ceiling. Apply the Wire of a well charged Vial to A, which will receive from the Wire a Quantity of the electrical Fluid, but will not imbibe it, being already full. The Fluid will therefore flow round it’s Surface and form an electrical Atmosphere. Bring A into Contact with B, and half the electrical Fluid is communicated; so that each has now an electrical Atmosphere (made of half the Quantity) and therefore they repel each other. Take away these Atmospheres by touching the Balls, and leave them in their natural State. Then having fixt a Stick of Sealing Wax to the Middle of the Phial, to hold it by, apply the Wire to A at the same time the Coating touches B. Thus will a Quantity of the Electrical Fluid be drawn out of B, and thrown on A, so that A will have a Redundance of this Fluid which forms an Atmosphere round it, and B an exactly equal Deficiency. Now bring these Balls again into Contact, and the Electrical Atmosphere will not be divided between A and B into two smaller Atmospheres, as before: for B will drink up the whole Atmosphere of A, and both will be found again in their natural State.  
15. The Form of the Electrical Atmosphere is that of the Body it surrounds. This Shape may be rendered visible in still Air, by raising a Smoke from dry Rosin, dropt into a hot Tea-Spoon under the electrified Body, which will be attracted and spread itself equally on all Sides, covering and concealing the Body.  
  
‡This has only been try’d on a Sphere. Try it on Bodies of other Figures.  
  
And this Form it takes, because it is attracted by all Parts of the Surface of the Body, tho’ it can not enter the Substance already replete. Without this Attraction it would not remain round the Body, but dissipate in the Air.  
16. The Atmosphere of Electrical Particles surrounding an electrify’d Sphere, is not more disposed to leave it, or more easily drawn off from any one Part of the Sphere than from another, because it is equally attracted from every Part. But that is not the Case with Bodies of any other Figure. From a Cube it is more easily drawn out at the Corners than at the plane Sides; and so from the Angles of a Body of any other Form, and still most easily from that Angle, that is most acute. Thus if a Body shaped as A, B, C, D, E be electrify’d or have an Electrical Atmosphere communicated to it, and we consider every Side as a Base on which the Particles rest, and by which they are attracted, one may see by imagining a Line from A to F and another from E to G, That the Portion of the Atmosphere included in F A E G has the Line A E for it’s Basis. So the Portion of Atmosphere included between the Lines H A, A B, and B I has the Line A B for it’s Basis. And likewise the Portion included in K, B, C, L, has B C to rest on; and so on the other Side of the Figure. Now if you would draw off this Atmosphere with a blunt smoothe Body and approach the Middle of the Side A, B, you must come very near before the Force of your Attracter exceeds the Power with which that Side holds it’s Atmosphere. But there is a small Portion between I B K that has less of the Surface to rest on and to be attracted by, than the neighbouring Portions; while at the same Time there is a mutual Repulsion between it’s Particles, and the Particles of those Portions: Therefore here you can get it with more Ease, or at a greater Distance. Between F, A, H, there is a larger Portion, that has yet a less Surface to rest on and to attract it: here therefore you can get it away still more easily: But easiest of all between L, C, M, where the Quantity is the largest, and the Surface to attract and keep it back the least.  
When you have drawn away one of these angular Portions of the Fluid, another succeeds in it’s Place, from the Nature of Fluidity and the mutual Repulsion before mentioned; and so the Atmosphere continues flowing off at such Angle like a Stream, ’till no more is remaining. The Extremities of the Portions of Atmosphere over these angular Parts, are likewise at a greater Distance from the Electrified Body, as may be seen by Inspection of the above Figure, than any Part of the other Portions: The Point of the Atmosphere of the Angle C, being much further from C, than any Part of the Atmosphere over the Lines C B or B A. And, besides the Distance arising from the Nature of the Figure, where the Attraction is less the Particles will naturally expand to a greater Distance by their mutual Repulsion. On these Accounts, we suppose Electrified Bodies discharge their Atmospheres upon unelectrified Bodies more easily, and at a greater Distance, from their Angles and Points, than from their smoothe Sides.  
Those Points will also discharge into the Air, when the Body has too great an electrical Atmosphere, without bringing any Non-electric near to receive what is thrown off. For the Air, tho’ itself an Electric per se, yet has always, more or less, Water and other non-electric Matters mixt with it; and these attract and receive what is so discharged.  
17. But Points have a Property by which they draw on as well as throw off the Electrical Fluid, at greater Distances than blunt Bodies can. That is, as the pointed Part of an electrify’d Body will discharge the Atmosphere of that Body, or communicate it farthest to another Body: so the Point of an unelectrifyed Body will draw off the Electrical Atmosphere from an electrified Body, farther than a blunter Part of the same unelectrified Body will do. Thus a Pin held by the Head, and the Point presented to an electrified Body, will draw off it’s Atmosphere at a Foot Distance; where, if the Head were presented instead of the Point, no such Effect would follow.  
To understand this, we may consider, that if a Person, standing on the Floor, would draw off the Electrical Atmosphere from an electrified Body; an Iron Crow, and a blunt Knitting-Needle held alternately in his Hand, and presented for that Purpose, do not draw with different Forces, in Proportion to their different Masses. For the Man, and what he holds in his Hand, be it large or small, are connected with the common Mass of unelectrify’d Matter; and the Force with which he draws is the same in both Cases; It consisting in the different Proportion of Electricity in the electrified Body and that common Mass. But the Force with which the electrified Body retains it’s Atmosphere, by attracting it, is proportioned to the Surface over which the Particles are plac’d; i.e. four square Inches of that Surface retain their Atmosphere with 4 times the Force, that one square Inch retains it’s Atmosphere. And as in Plucking the Hairs from the Horse’s Tail, a Degree of Strength, insufficient to pull away a Handful at once, could yet easily strip it Hair by Hair; so a blunt Body presented, cannot draw off a Number of Particles at once; but a pointed one, with no greater Force, takes them away easily, Particle by Particle.  
18. These Explanations of the Power and Operation of Points, when they first occurred to me, and while they floated in my Mind, appear’d perfectly satisfactory: But now I have wrote them, and considered them more closely in black and white, I must own, I have some Doubts about them. Yet as I have at present Nothing better to offer in their Stead, I do not cross them out: for even a bad Solution read, and it’s Faults discovered, has often given Rise to a good one in the Mind of an ingenious Reader.  
19. Nor is it of much Importance to us to know the Manner in which Nature executes her Laws; ’tis enough, if we know the Laws themselves. ’Tis of real Use to know, that China left in the Air unsupported, will fall and break; but how it comes to fall, and why it breaks, are Matters of Speculation. ’Tis a Pleasure indeed to know them, but we can preserve our China without it.  
20. Thus in the present Case, to know this Power of Points may possibly be of some Use to Mankind, tho’ we should never be able to explain it.  
The following Experiments, as well as those in my first Paper shew this Power. I have a large Prime Conductor, made of several thin Sheets of Fullers Pastboard form’d into a Tube, near 10 Foot long, and a Foot diameter. It is covered with Dutch embossed Paper almost totally gilt. This large metalline Surface supports a much greater electrical Atmosphere than a Rod of Iron of 50 Times the Weight would do. It is suspended by Silk Lines, and when charged will strike at near two Inches Distance, a pretty hard Stroke, so as to make one’s Knuckle ache. Let a Person standing on the Floor, present the Point of a Needle, at 12 or more Inches Distance from it; and while the Needle is so presented, the Conductor cannot be charg’d; the Point drawing off the Fire as fast as it is thrown on by the Electrifying Globe.  
Let it be charg’d and then present the Point at the same Distance, and it will suddenly be discharg’d. In the Dark, you see a Light on the Point, when the Experiment is made. And if the Person, holding the Point, stands upon Wax, he will be electrified by receiving the Fire at that Distance.  
Attempt to draw off the Electricity with a blunt Body, as a Bolt of Iron round at the End and smoothe (A Silversmith’s Iron Punch an Inch thick is what I use) and you must bring it within a Distance of near 2 Inches before You can do it; and then, it is done with a Stroke and Crack. As the Pasteboard Tube hangs loose on Silk Lines; when you approach it with the Punch Iron, it likewise will move towards the Punch; being attracted, while it is charg’d. But if at the same Instant a Point be presented, as before, it retires again, for the Point discharges it.  
Take a Pair of large Brass Scales, of two (or more) Feet Beam; the Cords of the Scales being Silk. Suspend the Beam by a Packthread from the Cieling, so that the Bottom of the Scales may be about a Foot from the Floor. The Scales will move round in a Circle by the Untwisting of the Packthread. Set the Iron Punch on End upon the Floor, in such a Place, as that the Scales may pass over it, in making their Circle; then Electrify one Scale by applying the Wire of a charged Vial to it. As they move round, you see the Scale draw nigher to the Floor, and dip more when it comes over the Punch; and if that be placed at a proper Distance, the Scale will snap and discharge it’s Fire into it. But if a Needle be stuck on the End of the Punch, it’s Point upwards, the Scale instead of drawing nigh to the Punch and snapping, discharges it’s Fire silently, thro’ the Point, and rises higher from the Punch. Nay even if the Needle be plac’d upon the Floor, near the Punch, it’s Point upwards, the End of the Punch tho’ so much higher than the Needle, will not attract the Scale and receive it’s Fire, for the Needle will get it and convey it away, before it comes nigh enough for the Punch to act. And this is constantly observable in these Experiments, that the greater Quantity of Electricity in the Pastboard Tube, the farther it strikes or discharges its Fire. And the Point likewise will draw it off at a still greater Distance.  
Now if the Fire of Electricity, and that of Lightning, be the same; as I have endeavoured to shew at large in a former Paper; this Pastboard Tube and these Scales may represent electrified Clouds. If a Tube only 10 Foot long, will strike and discharge it’s Fire on the Punch at 2 or 3 Inches Distance; an electrified Cloud of perhaps 10,000 Acres may strike and discharge on the Earth at a proportionably greater Distance. The horizontal Motion of the Scales over the Floor may represent the Motion of the Clouds over the Earth, and the Erect Iron Punch a Hill or high Building: and then we see how electrified Clouds passing over Hills or high Buildings, at too great a Height to strike, may be attracted lower till within their striking Distance. And lastly if a Needle fixt on the Punch, with it’s Point upright, or even on the Floor, below the Punch, will draw the Fire from the Scale silently at a much greater than the striking Distance and so prevent it’s descending towards the Punch; Or if in it’s Course, it would have come nigh enough to strike, yet, being first deprived of it’s Fire it cannot; and the Punch is thereby secured from the Stroke. I say, if these Things are so, may not the Knowledge of this Power of Points be of Use to Mankind; in preserving Houses, Churches, Ships &amp;c. from the Stroke of Lightning; by Directing us to fix on the highest Parts of those Edifices upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground; or down round one of the Shrouds of a Ship and down her Side, till it reach’d the Water? Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!  
21. To determine the Question, Whether the Clouds that contain Lightning are electrified or not, I would propose an Experiment to be try’d where it may be done conveniently.  
On the Top of some high Tower or Steeple, place a Kind of Sentry Box big enough to contain a Man and an electrical Stand. From the Middle of the Stand let an Iron Rod rise, and pass bending out of the Door, and then upright 20 or 30 feet, pointed very sharp at the End. If the Electrical Stand be kept clean and dry, a Man standing on it when such Clouds are passing low, might be electrified, and afford Sparks, the Rod drawing Fire to him from the Cloud. If any Danger to the Man should be apprehended (tho’ I think there would be none) let him stand on the Floor of his Box, and now and then bring near to the Rod, the Loop of a Wire, that has one End fastened to the Leads; he holding it by a Wax-Handle. So the Sparks, if the Rod is electrified, will Strike from the Rod to the Wire and not affect him.  
22. Before I leave this Subject of Lightning, I may mention some other Similarities between the Effects of that and those of Electricity. Lightning has often been known to strike People blind. A Pigeon that we struck dead to Appearance by the Electrical Shock, recovering Life, droopt about the Yard several Days, ate Nothing, tho’ Crums were thrown to it, but declined and dyed. We did not then think of it’s being deprived of Sight; but afterwards a Pullet struck dead in like Manner, being recover’d by repeated blowing into it’s Lungs, when set down on the Floor, ran headlong against the Wall, and on Examination appear’d perfectly blind. Hence we concluded, that the Pigeon had been absolutely blinded by the Shock. The biggest Animal we have yet killed, or try’d to kill with the Electrical Stroke was a well grown Pullet.  
23. Reading the ingenious Dr. Hales’s Account of the Thunder Storm at Stretham, the Effect of the Lightning in stripping off all the Paint that had covered a gilt Moulding of a Pannel of Wainscot, without hurting the Rest of the Paint: I had a Mind to lay a Coat of Paint over the filleting of Gold on the Cover of a Book, and try the Effect of a strong electrical Flash sent thro’ that Gold from a charged Sheet of Glass. But having no Paint at Hand, I pasted a narrow strip of Paper over it; and when dry sent a Flash thro’ the Gilding; by which the Paper was torne off from End to End with such Force, that it was broke in several Pieces, and in others brought away Part of the Grain of the Turky Leather, in which the Book was bound; and convinced me that had it been painted, the dry Paint would have been stripped off in the same Manner with that on the Wainscot at Stretham.  
24. Lightning melts Metals; and I hinted in my Paper on that Subject, that I suspected it to be a cold Fusion (I do not mean a Fusion by Force of Cold, but a Fusion without Heat.)  
We have also melted Gold, Silver and Copper in small Quantities by  
the Electrical Flash. The Manner is this: Take Leaf Gold, Leaf  
Silver or Leaf gilt Copper, commonly call’d Leaf Brass or Dutch  
Gold. Cut off from the Leaf long narrow Strips the Breadth of a  
Straw; Place one of these Strips between two Strips of smoothe  
Glass that are about as wide as your Finger. If one Strip of Gold, the Length of the Leaf, be not long enough for the Glass, add another to the End of it; so that you may have a little Part hanging out loose at each End of the Glass. Bind the Pieces of Glass together from End to End with a Silk Cord. Then place it so as to be part of an Electrical Circle (the Ends of Gold hanging out, being of Use to joyn with the other Parts of the Circle) and send the Flash thro it from a large electrified Jar. Then if your Strips of Glass remain whole you will see that the Gold is missing in several Places, and instead of it, a metalline Stain on both the Glasses. The Stains on the upper and under Glass are exactly similar in the Minutest Stroak, as may be seen by holding them to the Light. The Metal appears to have been not only melted, but even to be vitrified, or otherwise so driven into the Pores of the Glass as to be protected by it from the Action of the strongest Aqua fortis or Aqua Regia. I send you inclosed two little Pieces of Glass with these metaline stains upon them, which can not be removed without taking Part of the Glass with them. Sometimes the Stain spreads a little wider than the Breadth of the Leaf; and looks brighter at the Edge, as by inspecting closely you may observe in these. Sometimes the Glass breaks to Pieces. Once the upper Glass broke into a thousand Pieces like coarse Salt. These Pieces I send you were stained with Dutch Gold; true Gold makes a darker Stain somewhat reddish, Silver a greenish Stain. We once took two Pieces of thick Looking Glass, as broad as a Gunters Scale, and six Inches long; and placing Leaf Gold between them, put them betwixt two smoothly plain’d Pieces of Wood, and fixt them tight in a Bookbinder’s small Press: yet tho’ they were so closely confined; the Force of the Electrical Shock shiver’d the Glass into many Pieces. The Gold was melted and stain’d into the Glass as usual. The Circumstances of breaking the Glass differ much in Repeating the Experiment, and sometimes it does not break at all: But this is constant, that the Stains, in the upper and under Pieces, are exact Counterparts of each other: And tho’ I have often taken up the Pieces of Glass immediately after this melting, between my Fingers, I never could perceive the least Warmth in them.  
25. In one of my former Papers I mentioned that Gilding on a Book, tho’ at first it communicated the Shock perfectly well, yet fail’d after a few Experiments, which we could not account for. We have since found, that one strong Shock breaks the Continuity of the Gold in the Filetting, and makes it look rather like Dust of Gold; Abundance of it’s Parts being broken and driven off; And it will seldom conduct above one strong Shock. Perhaps this may be the Reason; When there is not a perfect Continuity in the Circle, the Fire must leap over the Vacancies; there is a certain Distance which it is able to leap over a Vacancy, according to it’s Strength; if a Number of small Vacancies, tho’ each be very minute, taken together exceed that Distance, it can not leap over them, and so the Shock is prevented.  
26. From the before mentioned Law of Electricity, That Points as they are more or less acute, both draw on and throw off the Electrical Fluid with more or less Power, and at greater or less Distances, and in larger or smaller Quantities in the same Time; we may see how to account for the Situation of the Leaf-Gold suspended between two Plates, the upper one continually electrified, the under one in a Person’s Hand standing on the Floor. When the upper Plate is Electrified, the Leaf is attracted and raised towards it, and would fly to that Plate, were it not for it’s own Points: the Corner that happens to be uppermost, as the Leaf is rising; being a sharp Point from the extream Thinness of the Gold, draws and receives at a Distance a sufficient Quantity of the electrical Fluid, to give itself an Electrical Atmosphere, by which it’s Progress to the upper Plate is stopt, and it begins to be repell’d from that Plate, and would be driven back to the under Plate, but that it’s lowest Corner is likewise a Point, and throws off or discharges the Overplus of the Leaf’s Atmosphere, as fast as the upper Corner draws it on. Were these two Points perfectly equal in Acuteness, the Leaf would take Place exactly in the middle Space; for it’s Weight is a Trifle compar’d to the Power acting on it. But it is generally nearest the unelectrified Plate, because, when the Leaf is offered to the electrified Plate at a Distance, the sharpest Point is commonly first affected, and raised towards it; so that Point from it’s greater Acuteness receiving the Fluid faster than it’s opposite can discharge it at equal Distances, it retires from the electrified Plate, and draws nearer to the unelectrified Plate, ’till it comes to a Distance where the Discharge can be exactly equal to the Receipt, the latter being lessened and the former increased; and there it remains, as long as the Globe continues to supply fresh Electrical Matter. This will appear plain, when the Difference of Acuteness in the Corners is made very great. Cut a Piece of Dutch Gold (which is the fittest for these Experiments, on Account of it’s greater Strength) into the Form in the Margin; the upper Corner a right Angle, the two next obtuse Angles, and the lowest a very acute one; and bring this on your Plate under the electrified Plate, in such a Manner, as that the right Angle Part may be first raised (which is done by covering the Narrow End with the Hollow of your Hand) and you will see this Leaf take Place much nearer to the upper than to the under Plate; because without being nearer, it can not receive so fast at its right angle’d Point as it can discharge at it’s acute one. Turn this Leaf with the acute Part uppermost, and then it takes Place nearest the unelectrified Plate; because otherwise it receives faster at its acute Point than it can discharge at it’s right angled one. Thus the Difference of Distance is always proportioned to the Difference of Acuteness. Take Care, in cutting your Leaf to leave no little ragged Particles on the Edges, which sometimes form Points where you would not have them. You may make this Figure so acute below and dull above, as to need no under Plate: it discharging fast enough into the Air. When it is made narrower; as the Figure between the prickt Lines, we call it the Golden Fish, from its Manner of Acting: for if you take it by the Tail, and hold it at a Foot or greater horizontal Distance from the Prime Conductor, it will, when let go, fly to it with a brisk but waving Motion, like that of a Fish thro’ the Water: It will then take Place under the Prime Conductor, at perhaps a Quarter or Half an Inch Distance, and keep continual Shaking of it’s Tail like a Fish; so that it seems animated. Turn it’s Tail to the Prime Conductor, and then it flies to your Finger and seems to nibble it. And if you hold a Plate under it at 6 or 8 Inches Distance, and cease turning the Globe; when the Electrical Atmosphere of the Conductor grows small, it will descend to the Plate and swim back again several Times with the same Fish-like Motion, greatly to the Entertainment of Spectators. By a little Practice in dulling or sharpning the Heads or Tails of these Figures, you make them take Place as desired, nearer or farther from the Electrified Plate.  
27. It is said in Section 8. of this Paper that all Kinds of common Matter are supposed not to attract the Electrical Fluid with equal Strength: and that those call’d Electrics per Se, as Glass &amp;c. attract and retain it strongest, and contain the greatest Quantity.  
This latter Position may seem a Paradox to some, being contrary to the hitherto received Opinion, and therefore I shall now endeavour to explain it.  
28. In Order to this, let it first be consider’d That we can not, by any Means we are yet acquainted with, force the Electrical Fluid thro’ Glass. I know it is commonly thought that it easily pervades Glass; and the Experiment of a Feather suspended by a Thread in a Bottle hermetically sealed, yet moved by bringing a rubb’d Tube near the outside of the Bottle, is alledg’d to prove it. But if the Electrical Fluid so easily pervades Glass, How does the Vial become charg’d (as we term it) when we hold it in our Hands? Would not the Fire thrown in by the Wire, pass thro’ to our Hands, and so escape into the Floor? Would not the Bottle in that Case be left just as we found it, uncharg’d; as we know a Metal Bottle, so attempted to be charg’d would be? Indeed if there be the least Crack, the minutest Solution of Continuity in the Glass, tho’ it remains so light, that Nothing else we know of will pass, yet the extreamly subtile electrical Fluid, flies thro’ such a Crack with the greatest Freedom, and such Bottle we know can never be charg’d:  
  
*See the first 16 sections of the third Letter, p. 31 &amp;c. [above, III, 352–6].  
  
What then makes the Difference between such a Bottle, and one that is sound, but this; That the Fluid can pass thro’ the one and not thro’ the other?  
29. It is true, there is an Experiment that at first Sight would be apt to satisfy a slight Observer, that the Fire thrown into the Bottle by the Wire does really pass thro’ the Glass. It is this: Place the Bottle on a Glass Stand under the Prime Conductor: suspend a Bullet by a Chain from the Prime Conductor, ’till it comes within a quarter of an Inch, right over the Wire of the Bottle; Place your Knuckle on the Glass Stand, at just the same Distance from the Coating of the Bottle, as the Bullet is from it’s Wire. Now let the Globe be turnd, and you see a Spark strike from the Bullet to the Wire of the Bottle, and the same Instant you see and feel an exactly equal Spark striking from the Coating to your Knuckle: and so on Spark for Spark.  
  
†See § 10 of the third Letter, p. 36 [above, III, 355].  
  
This looks, as if the whole received by the Bottle was again discharged from it: and yet the Bottle by this means is chargd! And therefore the Fire that thus leaves the Bottle, tho’ the same in Quantity, can not be the very same Fire that entered at the Wire: For, if it were, the Bottle would remain uncharg’d.  
  
30. If the Fire that so leaves the Bottle be not the same that is thrown in, thro’ the Wire, it must be Fire that subsisted in the Bottle (that is in the Glass of the Bottle) before the Operation begun.  
31. If so, there must be a great Quantity in Glass, because a great Quantity is thus discharg’d even from very thin Glass.  
32. That this Electrical Fluid or Fire, is strongly attracted by Glass, we know from the Quickness and Violence with which it is resum’d by the Part that had been deprived of it, when there is an Opportunity. And by this, that we can not from a Mass of Glass draw a Quantity of Electrical Fire; or electrify the whole Mass minus, as we can a Mass of Metal. We cannot lessen nor increase it’s whole Quantity; for what it has it holds; and it has as much as it can hold: It’s Pores are fill’d with it as full as the mutual Repellency of the Particles will admit: and what is already in, refuses or strongly repels any additional Quantity. Nor have we any Way of Moving this Electrical Fluid in Glass, but one; that is, by covering Part of the two Surfaces of thin Glass with Non-electrics; and then throwing an additional Quantity of this Fluid on one Surface, which spreading in the Non-electric; and being bound to that Surface by it, acts by it’s repelling Force on the Particles of electrical Fluid contain’d in the other Surface, and drives them out of the Glass into the Non-electric on that Side from whence they are discharg’d; And those added on the charg’d Side can then enter. But when this is done, there is no more in the Glass, nor less than before; just as much having left it on one Side, as it received on the other.  
33. I feel a Want of Terms here, and doubt much, whether I shall be able to make this intelligible. By the Word Surface in this Case, I do not mean mere Length and Breadth without Thickness: But when I speak of the upper or under Surface of a Piece of Glass, the outer or inner Surface of the Phial, I mean Length, Breadth and half the Thickness; and beg the Favour of being so understood.  
Now I suppose that Glass in it’s first Principles, and in the Furnace, has no more of this electrical Fluid than other common Matter: That when it is blown, as it cools, and the Particles of common Fire leave it, it’s Pores become a perfect Vacuum: That the component Parts of Glass are extreamly small and fine, I guess from it’s never shewing a rough Face where it breaks, but always a Polish; and from the Smallness of its Particles, I suppose the Pores between them must be exceeding small; which is the Reason that Aqua fortis, nor any other Menstruum we have, can enter to separate them, and dissolve the Substance, nor is any Fluid we know of, fine enough to enter, except common Fire and the electrical Fluid. Now the Departing Fire, leaving a Vacuum, as aforesaid, between these Pores, which Air nor Water are fine enough to enter and fill; the Electrical Fluid (which is every where ready in what we call the Non-electrics, and in the Non-electric Mixtures that are in the Air) presses or is attracted in: yet does not become fixt with the Substance of the Glass, but subsists there as Water in a Porous Stone, retain’d only by the Attraction of the fixt Parts, itself still loose and fluid.  
But I suppose farther, that in the Cooling of the Glass, it’s Texture becomes closest in the Middle, and forms a Kind of Partition, in which the Pores are so narrow, that the Particles of the Electrical Fluid, which enter both Surfaces at the same Time, cannot go thro’ or pass and repass from one Surface to the other, and so mix together. Yet tho’ the Particles of Electrical Fluid imbib’d by each Surface can not themselves pass thro’ to those of the other, their Repellency can; and by this Means they act on one another. The Particles of Electrical Fluid have a mutual Repellency, but by the Power of Attraction in the Glass, they are condensed or forced nearer to each other.  
When the Glass has receiv’d, and by it’s Attraction forced closer together so much of this elastic Fluid, as that the Power of Attracting and condensing in the one is equal to the Power of Expansion in the other, it can imbibe no more, and that remains it’s constant whole Quantity; But each Surface could receive more, if the Repellency of what is in the opposite Surface did not resist it’s Entrance. The Quantities of this Fluid in each Surface being equal, their repelling Action on each other is equal: and therefore those of one Surface cannot drive out those of the other. But if a greater Quantity is forced into one Surface than the Glass would naturally draw in; this increases the repelling Power on that Side, and overpowering the Attraction on the other, drives out Part of the Fluid, that had been imbibed by that Surface, if there be any Non-electric ready to receive it: Such there is in all Cases, where Glass is electrified to give a Shock.  
The Surface that has been thus emptied, by having it’s Electrical Fluid driven out, resumes again an equal Quantity with Violence, as soon as the Glass has an Opportunity to discharge that over-Quantity, more than it could retain by Attraction in it’s other Surface, by the additional Repellency of Which the Vacuum had been occasioned. For Experiments favouring this Hypothesis, I must, to avoid Repetition, beg Leave to refer you back to what is said of the Electrical Vial in my former Papers.  
34. Let us now see, how it will account for several other Appearances.  
Glass, a Body extreamly elastic (and perhaps it’s Elasticity may be owing in some Degree to the subsisting of so great Quantity of this repelling Fluid in it’s Pores) must, when rubb’d, have it’s rubb’d Surface somewhat stretcht, or it’s solid Parts drawn a little farther asunder; so that the Vacancies in which the Electrical Fluid resides, become larger, affording Room for more of that Fluid, which is immediately attracted into it, from the Cushion or Hand rubbing, they being supply’d from the common Stock. But the Instant the Parts of the Glass so opened and filled have past the Friction, they close again, and force the additional Quantity out upon the Surface, where it must rest, till that Part comes round to the Cushion again; unless some Non-electric (as the Prime Conductor) first presents to receive it. In the Dark, the Electrical Fluid may be seen on the Cushion in two Semi-circles or Half-moons, one on the Fore-Part, the other on the Back Part of the Cushion, just where the Globe and Cushion separate. In the fore Crescent, the Fire is passing out of the Cushion into the Glass; in the other it is leaving the Glass and returning into the Back Part of the Cushion. When the Prime Conductor is apply’d, to take it off the Glass, the back Crescent disappears.  
But if the inside of the Globe be lined with a Non-electric, the additional Repellency of the electrical Fluid thus collected by Friction in the rubb’d Part of the Globe’s outer Surface, drives an equal Quantity out of the inner Surface into that Non-electric Lining, which receiving it and carrying it away from the rubb’d Part into the common Mass thro’ the Axis of the Globe and Frame of the Machine; The new collected Electrical Fluid can enter and remain in the outer Surface, and none of it, or a very little, will be received by the Prime Conductor. As this charg’d Part of the Globe comes round to the Cushion again, the outer Surface delivers it’s Overplus Fire into the Cushion; the opposite inner Surface receiving at the same Time an equal Quantity from the Floor.  
Every Electrician knows that a Globe wet within will give little or no Fire; the Reason has not before been attempted to be given that I know of.  
35. So if a Tube lined with a Non-electric be rubb’d, little or no Fire is obtained from it. What is collected from the Hand in the downward rubbing Stroke entring the Pores of the Glass, and driving an equal Quantity out of the inner Surface into the Non-electric Lining. And the Hand in passing up to take a second Stroke, takes out again what had been thrown into the outer Surface; and then the inner Surface receives back again, what it had given to the Non-electric Lining. Thus the Particles of Electrical Fluid belonging to the inside Surface go in and out of their Pores every Stroke given to the Tube. Put a Wire into the Tube, the inward End in Contact with the Non-electric Lining, so it will represent the Leyden Bottle. Let a Second Person touch the Wire while you rub, and the Fire driven out of the inward Surface, when you give the Stroke, will pass thro’ him into the common Mass, and return thro’ him, when the inner Surface resumes it’s Quantity; and therefore this new Kind of Leiden Bottle can not so be charg’d; But thus it may. After every Stroke, before you pass your Hand up to make another, let the second Person apply his Finger to the Wire, take the Spark and then withdraw his Finger; and so on till he has drawn a Number of Sparks; thus will the inner Surface be exhausted, and the outer Surface charg’d. Then wrap a Sheet of gilt Paper close round the outer Surface; and grasping it with one Hand, you may receive a Shock, by applying the Finger of the other Hand to the Wire. For now the vacant Pores in the inner Surface resume their Quantity, and the overcharg’d Pores in the outer Surface discharge that Overplus: the Equilibrium being restored thro’ your Body, which could not be restored thro’ the Middle of the Glass.  
  
‡See §15 of the third Letter p. 39 [above, III, 356].  
  
  
If the Tube be exhausted of Air a Non-electric Lining in Contact with the Wire is not necessary: For in Vacuo, the Electrical Fire will fly freely from the inner Surface to the Wire, and back again from the Wire to the inner Surface, without a Non-electric Conductor. But Air resists it’s Motion, for being itself an Electric per Se, it does not attract it, having already it’s Quantity. So the Air never draws off an Electrical Atmosphere from any Body, but in Proportion to the Non electrics mixt with it: It rather keeps such an Atmosphere confined, which from the mutual Repulsion of it’s Particles tends to dissipation, and would immediately dissipate in Vacuo.  
And thus the Experiment of the Feather inclosed in a Glass Vessel hermetically seal’d but moving on the Approach of the rubbed Tube is explained. When an additional Quantity of the Electrical Fluid is apply’d to the Side of the Vessel by the Atmosphere of the Tube, a Quantity is repell’d and driven out of the inner Surface of that Side into the Vessel, and there affects the Feather; returning again into it’s Pores, when the Tube with it’s Atmosphere is withdrawn: not that the Particles of that Atmosphere did themselves pass thro’ the Glass to the Feather. And every other Appearance I have yet seen, in which Glass and Electricity are concern’d, are I think explain’d, with equal Ease, by the same Hypothesis. Yet perhaps it may not be a true one, and I shall be obliged to him that affords me a better.  
36. Thus I take the Difference between Non-Electrics, and Glass, an Electric per Se, to consist in these two Particulars,  
1. That a Non-electric easily suffers a Change in the Quantity of the Electrical Fluid it contains: you may lessen its whole Quantity by drawing out a Part, which the whole Body will again resume; But Glass, you can only lessen the Quantity contained in one of it’s Surfaces; and not that, but by supplying an equal Quantity at the same Time to the other Surface; so that the whole Glass may always have the same Quantity in the two Surfaces; their two different Quantities being added together. And this can only be done in Glass that is thin; beyond a certain Thickness we have yet no Power that can make this Change. And,  
2. That the Electrical Fire freely removes from Place to Place in and thro’ the Substance of a Non-Electric, but not so thro’ the Substance of Glass. If you offer a Quantity to one End of a long rod of Metal, it receives it, and when it enters, every Particle that was before in the Rod pushes it’s Neighbour and so on quite to the farther End where the Overplus is discharg’d; and this instantaneously, when the Rod is Part of the Circle in the Experiment of the Shock. But Glass from the Smalness of it’s Pores, or stronger Attraction of what it contains, refuses to admit so free a Motion. A Glass Rod will not conduct a Shock, nor will the thinnest Glass suffer any Particle entring one of it’s Surfaces to pass thro’ to the other.  
37. Hence we see the Impossibility of Success in the Experiments proposed to draw out the effluvial Virtues of a Non-electric as Cinnamon for Instance, and mixing them with the Electrical Fluid, to convey them with that into the Body, by including it in the Globe, and then Applying Friction &amp;c. For tho’ the Effluvia of Cinnamon and the Electrical Fluid, should mix within the Globe, they would never come out together thro’ the Pores of the Glass, and so go to the Prime Conductor. For the Electrical Fluid itself can not come thro’, and the Prime Conductor is always supply’d from the Cushion, and that from the Floor. And besides, when the Globe is filled with Cinnamon, or other Non-electric, no electrical Fluid can be obtained from it’s outer Surface, for the Reason before mentioned. I have try’d another Way, which I tho

om the Floor thro’ the Machine; the Communication that Way being cut off by the Glass Plate under the Cushion: It must then draw it thro’ the Chains, whose Ends were dipt in the Oil of Turpentine. And as the Oil of Turpentine being an Electric per Se could not conduct; what came up from the Floor was obliged to jump from the End of one Chain to the End of the other, thro’ the Substance of that Oyl, which we could see in large Sparks; and so it had a fair Opportunity of Seizing some of the finest Particles of the Oyl in it’s Passage, and carrying them off with it: But no such Effect followed: nor could I perceive the least Difference in the Smell of the Electrical Effluvia thus collected, from what it has when collected otherwise; nor does it otherwise affect the Body of a Person electrised.  
I likewise put into a Phial, instead of Water, a strong Purgative Liquid, and then charg’d the Phial, and took repeated Shocks from it: In which Case, every Particle of the Electrical Fluid, must, before it went thro’ my Body, have first gone thro’ the Liquid, when the Phial was charging, and return’d thro’ it when discharging; yet no other Effect follow’d than if [it] had been charg’d with Water. I have also smelt the Electrical Fire, when drawn thro’ Gold, Silver, Copper, Lead, Iron, Tin, Wood and the human Body, and could perceive no Difference; the Odour is always the same, where the Spark does not burn what it strikes: Therefore I imagine it does not take that Smell from any Quality of the Bodies it passes thro’. And indeed as that Smell so readily leaves the Electrical Matter, and adheres to the Knuckle receiving the Sparks, and to other Things; I suspect that it never was connected with it, but rises instantaneously from Something in the Air acted upon by it. For if it was fine enough to come with the Electrical Fluid thro’ the Body of one Person, why should it stop on the Skin of another?  
But I shall never have done, if I tell You all my Conjectures, Thoughts and Imaginations on the Nature and Operations of this Electrical Fluid, and relate the Variety of little Experiments we have try’d.  
I have already made this Paper too long for which I must crave Pardon, not having Time to make it shorter. I shall only add, That as it has been observed here, that Spirits will fire by the Electrical Spark in the Summer Time, without heating, when Fahrenheits Thermometer is above 70°.

ſtrong attraction between them and other matter, ariſe this  
effect, that when. a quantity of electrical matter, is ap-  
plied to a maſs of common matter, of any bigneſs or length  
within our obſervation (which has not already got its  
quantity) it is immediately and equally diffuſed through  
the whole. |  
  
6. Thus common matter is a kind of fpunge to the  
electrical fluid. And as a ſpunge would receive no Was  
ter, if the parts of water were not ſmaller than the pores |  
of the ſpunge ; and even then, but ſlowly, if there were  
not a mutual attraction between thoſe parts and the parts  
of the ſpunge; and would ſtill imbibe it faſter, if the  
mutual attraction among the parts of the water did not  
impede, ſome force being required to ſeparate them; and  
faſteſt, if, inſtead of attraction, there were a mutual repul-  
ſion among thoſe parts, which would act in conjunction  
with the attraction of the ſpunge. So is the * between  
the electrical and common matter. | |  
  
7. But in common matter there is (generally) as much  
of the electrical, as it will contain within its ſubſtance. If  
more is added, it lies without upon. the ſurface, and forms  
what we call an electrical atmoſphere: and then the N :  
is ſaid to be electrified.  
  
8. Tis ſuppoſed, that all kinds of common matter 5  
not attract and retain the electrical, with equal ſtrength and  
  
force; for reaſons to be given hereafter. And that thoſe

ſtrongeſt, and contain the greateſt quantity. 1,  
9. We know that the electrical fluid is in common  
matter, becauſe we. can pump it out by the globe or tube.  
We know that common matter has near as much as it can  
contain, becauſe, when we add a little more to any pro-  
tion of it, the additional quantity does not enter, but forms  
an electrical atmoſphere. And we know that common

they conſtantly do when they have electric atmoſpheres.

creation, we are not yet well acquainted with, though  
  
  
we may ſee ſome pernicious conſequences, that would at-  
  
  
we live on as much of it in proportion, as we can give to a  
globe of iron, wood, or the like, the particles of duſt and

Bring A into contact with B, and half the electrical fluid  
is communicated, ſo that each has now an electrical at-  
moſphere, and therefore they repel each other. Take  
away theſe atmoſpheres by touching the balls, and leave  
them in their natural ſtate: then, having fixed a ſtick of  
ſealing wax to the middle of the vial to hold it by, apply  
the wire to A, at the ſame time the coating touches B.  
Thus will a quantity of the electrical fluid be drawn out  
of B, and thrown on A. So that A will have a redun-  
dance of this fluid, which forms an atmoſphere round it,  
and B an exactly equal deficiency. Now bring theſe  
balls again into contact, and the electrical atmoſphere  
will not be divided between A and B, into two ſmaller  
atmoſpheres as before; for B will drink up the whole at-  
moſphere of A, and boch will be . again in their na-  
tural ſtate. 4  
15. The form of the electrical atmoſphere i is that of  
the body it ſurrounds. This ſhape may be rendered  
viſible in a ſtill air, by raiſing a ſmoke from dry roſin,  
dropt into a hot tea-ſpoon under the electriſed body,  
which will be attracted and ſpread itſelf equaly on all  
ſides, covering and concealing the body. And this form  
it takes, becauſe it is attracted by all parts of the ſurface of  
the body, tho&#x27; it cannot enter the ſubſtance already replete.  
Without this attraction it would not remain round the bo-  
dy, but diſſipate in the air. LES

an electrified ſphere, is not more diſpoſed to leave it or

more eaſi ly drawn off from any one part of the ſphere: hs |  
from another, becauſe it is equally attracted by every part,  
But that is not the caſe with bodies of any other figure.  
From a cube it is more eaſily drawn at the corners than at  
the plane ſides, and fo from the angles of a body of any  
other form, and till moſt eaſily from the angle that is  
moſt acute. Thus if a body ſhaped as A, B, C, D, E, in Fig. 8,  
be electrified, or have an electrical atmoſphere communi-  
cated to it, and we conſider every fide as -a baſe on which  
the particles reſt and by which they are attracted, one  
may ſee, by imagining a line from A to F, and another  
from E to G, that the portion of the atmoſphere included  
in F, A, E, G, has the line A, E, for its baſis. So the por-  
tion of atmoſphere included in H, A, B, I, has the line  
A, B, for its baſis. And likewiſe the portion inclu-  
  
ded in K, B, C, L, has B, C, to reſt on; and ſo  
  
on the other ſide of the figure. Now if you would  
draw off this atmoſphere with any blunt ſmooth body,  
and approach the middle of the fide A, B, you muſt come  
very near before the force of your attracter exceeds the  
force or power with which that ſide holds its atmoſphere.  
But there is a ſmall portion between I, B, K, that has leſs of  
the ſurfaceto reſt on, and to be attracted by, than the neigh-  
bouring portions, while at the ſame time there is a mutual  
repulſion between its particles and the particlesof thoſe por-  
tions, therefore here you can get it with more eaſe or at a  
greater diſtance. Between F, A, H, there is a larger por-  
tion that has yet a leſs ſurface to reſt on and to attract it;

bers Kiirefors you can get it away ſtill more eaſily. But  
eaſieſt of all between „ M, where the quantity is lar- |  
geſt, and the ſurface to attract and keep it back the leaſt.  
When you have drawn away one of theſe angular porti-  
ons of the fluid, another ſucceeds in its place, from the  
nature of fluidity and. the mutual repulſion beforemention-  
ed; and ſo the atmoſphere continues flowing off at ſuch  
angle, like a ſtream, till no more is remaining. The ex-  
tremities of the portions of atmoſphere over theſe angular  
parts are likewiſe at a greater diſtance from the electrified  
body, as may be ſeen by the inſpection of the above figure;  
the point of the atmoſphere of the angle C, being much  
farther from C, than any other part of the atmoſphere over  
the lines C, B, or B, A: And beſides the diſtance ariſing  
  
  
the particles will naturally Expand to a greater diſtance by  
their mutual repulſion. - On theſe accounts we ſuppoſe e-  
  
  
trified bodies more eaſily and at a greater diſtance from  
their angles and points than from their ſmooth fides.— .  
  
  
dy has too great an electrical atmoſphere, without bring-  
ing any non- electric near, to receive what is thrown off:  
For the air, though an electric per ſe, yet has always more  
or leſs water and other non- electric matters mixed with it;  
and theſe attract and receive what is ſo diſcharged. |

than blunt bodies can. That is, as the pointed part of an  
ele&amp;rified body will diſcharge the atmoſphere of that bo-  
dy, or communicate it fartheſt to another body, ſo the  
point of an unelectrified body, will draw off the electrical  
atmoſphere from an electrified body, farther than a blunter  
part of the ſame unelectrified body will / do. Thus a pin  
held by the head, and the point preſented to an electri ſied  
body, will draw off its atmoſphere at a foot diſtance;  
where if the head were preſented inſtead of the point; no  
ſuch effect would follow. To underſtand this, we may  
conſider, that if a perſon ſtanding on the floor would  
draw off the electrical atmoſphere from an electrified bo-  
dy, an iron crow and a blunt knitting kneedle held alter -  
nately in his hand and preſented for that purpoſe, do not  
draw with different forces in proportion to their different  
maſſes, For the man, and what he holds in his hand, be  
it large or ſmall, are connected with the common maſs  
of unelectrified matter ; and the force with which he  
draws is the ſame in both caſes, it conſiſting in the diffe

ing, and from the foot of thoſe rods a wire down the

one of the ſhrouds of a ſhip, and down her fide till it  
reaches the water? Would not theſe pointed rods proba- |

it came nigh enough to ſtrike, and thereby ſecure us from

niently. On the top of ſome high tower or ſteeple; place a  
kind of ſentry-box, (as in FIG. 9.) big enough to contain a  
man and an electrical ſtand. F 10 the middle of the ſtand,  
  
let an iron rod riſe and paſs bending out of the door, and  
then uptight 20 or 30 feet, pointed very ſharp at the end.  
  
If the electrical ſtand be kept clean and dry, a man  
ſtanding on it when ſuch clouds are paſſing low, might  
be electrified and afford ſparks, the rod drawing fire  
days ns a cloud. If any danger to the man ſhould  
be apprehended (though I think there would be none)  
  
  
end faſtened to the leads, he holding it by a wax handle;

Before I leave this ſubject of lightning, I may men-  
Bir er other ſimilarities between the effects of that,  
and theſe of electricity. Lightning has often been known

The biggeſt animal we have yet killed or try&#x27;d to kill

23. Reading in the ingenious Dr. Halers account of  
  
  
in ſtripping off all the paint that had { covered A gilt N  
  
  
reſt of the paint, I had a mind to lay a coat of paint  
over the filleting of gold on the cover of a book, and  
try the effect of a ſtrong electrical flaſh ſent through that  
gold from a charged ſheet of glaſs. But having no paint  
at hand, I paſted a narrow ſtrip of paper over it; and  
when dry, ſent the flaſh through the gilding; by which  
  
  
that it was broke in ſeveral places, and in others brought  
away part of the grain of the Turky-leather in which  
it was bound; and convinced me, that had it been paint-  
ed, the paint would have been ſtript off in the ſame  
manner with that on the wainſcot at Stretbham.

per on that ſubject, that I ſuſpected it to he a cold fy- 5

fuss without heat. We have alſo melted gold, ſilver,

gilt copper, commonly called leaf braſs or Dutch gold:

ſmooth glaſs that are about the width of your. finger. -  
one ſtrip of gold, the length of the- leaf, be not long .  
nough for the glaſs, add another to the end of it, ſo that  
you may have a little part hanging out looſe at each end  
of the glaſs. Bind the pieces of glaſs together from end  
to end with ſtrong ſilk thread; then place it ſo as to be  
part of an electrical circle, (the ends of gold hanging out  
being of uſe to join with the other parts of the circle)  
and ſend the flaſh through it, from a large electrified  
jar or ſheet of glaſs. Then if your ſtrips of glaſs remain  
whole, you will ſee that the gold is miſſing in ſeveral  
places, and inſtead of it a metallic ſtain on both the  
glaſſes; the ſtains on the upper and under glaſs exactly  
ſimilar in the minuteſt ſtroke, as may be ſeen by holding  
them to the light; the metal appeared to have been not

the action of the ſtrongeſt Agua Fortis and Ag: Regia. I  
ſend you encloſed two little pieces of glaſs with theſe  
metallic ſtains upon them, which cannot be removed with  
out taking part of the glaſs with them. Sometimes the  
ſtain ſpreads a little wider than the breadth of the leaf,  
and looks brighter at the edge, as by inſpecting cloſely

two pleces of thick lookihg-glaſs, as broad as a Gunter&#x27;s  
ſcale, and 6 inches long; and placing leaf gold between  
them, put them betwixt two ſmoothly plain&#x27;d pieces of  
wood, and fix d them tight i in a book-binder&#x27;s ſmall pteſs;  
yet though they were ſo cloſely | confined, the force of the  
electrical ſhock ſhivered the glaſs into many pieces. The  
gold was melted and ſtain d into the glaſs as uſual. The  
circumſtances of the breaking of the glaſs differ much  
in making the experiment, and ſometimes it does not  
break at all : but this is conſtant, that the ſtains in the  
upper and under pieces are exact counterparts of each o-  
ther. And though I have taken up the pieces of glaſs  
between my fingers immediately after this melting, I ne-  
ver could perceive the leaſt warmth in them.  
  
25. In one of my former papers, I mention&#x27;d, that  
gilding on a book, though at firſt it communicated the  
ſhock perfectly well, yet fail&#x27;d after a few experiments,  
which we could not account for. We have ſince found,  
that one ſtrong ſhock breaks the continuity of the gold  
in the filleting, and makes it look rather like duſt of  
  
gold, abundance of its parts being broken and driven off;  
and it will ſeldom conduct above one ſtrong ſhock. Per-  
  
aps this may be the reaſon ; when there is not a perfect  
continuity in the circle, the fire muſt leap over the va-  
cancies ; there is a certain diſtance which it is able to  
| leap over according to its ſtrength ; if a number of

for its own points. The corner that happens to be up-  
  
  
the extream thinneſs of the gold, draws and receives at  
  
  
to the upper plate is ſtopt, and it begins to be repelled  
from that plate, and would be driven back to the  
under plate, but that its loweſt corner is likewiſe a  
point, and throws off or diſcharges the overplus of the  
&quot;T4 atmoſphere, as faſt as the upper corner draws it  
n. Were theſe two points perfectly equal in acuteneſs,  
he leaf would take place exactly in the middle ſpace,  
for its Weight is a trifle, compared to the power acting  
on it: But it is generally neareſt the unelectrified plate,  
becauſe, when the leaf is offered to the electrified plate

cuteneſs, receiving the fluid faſter than its de can  
diſcharge i it at equal diſtances, it retires from the electri-  
fied plate, and draws nearer to the unelectrified Plate,  
till it comes to a diſtance where the diſcharge can be ex-  
actly equal to the receipt, the latter being leſſened, and  
the former encreaſed; and there it remains as long as the  
globe continues to ſupply freſh electrical matter. This  
  
will appear plain, when the difference of acuteheſs in  
the corners is made very great. Cut a piece of Dutch  
gold (which is fitteſt for theſe experiments on account of  
its greater ſtrength) into the form of F1s. 10 the up-  
per corner a right angle, the two next obtuſe angles,  
and the loweſt a very acute one; and bring this on your  
plate under the electrified plate, in ſuch a manner as  
that the right-angled part may be firſt raiſed (which is.  
done by covering the acute part with the hollow of your  
hand) and you will ſee this leaf take place much nearer  
to the upper than to the under plate; becauſe, without  
being nearer, it cannot receive ſo faſt at its right-angled  
point, as it can diſcharge at its acute one. Turn this  
leaf with the acute part uppermoſt, and then it takes  
place neareſt the unelectrified plate, becauſe otherwiſe  
it receives faſter at its acute point than it can diſcharge  
at its right-angled one. Thus the difference of diſtance  
is always proportioned to the difference of acuteneſs.  
Take care in cutting your leaf to leave no little ragged  
particles on the edges, which ſometimes. form points  
  
where you would not have them. You- may make this

ligure ſo acute below ank blunt one as to need no under  
plate, it diſcharging faſt enough into the air. When it is  
made narrower, as the figure between the pricked lines,  
we call it the Golden Fb, from its manner of acting. For  
if you take it by the tail, and hold it at a foot or greater  
horizontal diſtance from the prime conductor, it will,  
when let go, fly to it with a briſk but-wavering motion,  
like that of an cel through the water; it will then take  
place under the prime conductor, at perhaps a quarter  
or half an inch diſtance, and keep à continual ſhaking of  
its tail like a fiſh, ſo that it ſeems animated. Turn its tail  
towards the prime conductor, and then it flies to your  
finger, and ſeems to nibble it. And: if you hold a plate  
under it at ſix or eight inches diſtance, and ceaſe turning  
the Globe, when the electrical atmoſphere of the conduc-  
tor grows ſmall, it will deſcend to the plate and ſwim back  
again ſeveral times witli the ſame fiſh-like motion, greatly  
to the entertainment of ſpectators. By a little practice in  
blunting or ſharpening the heads or tails of theſe figures,  
you may make them take place as defired, -Nearer,. or  
farther from the elecrified plate. |

fluid with equal ſtrength; and that thoſe called electrics  
per. ſe, as glaſs, &amp;c. attract and retain it ſtrongeſt, and con-

not imbibe it, being already full. The fluid therefore will  
flow round its ſurface, and form an electrical atmoſphere.

Bring A into&#x27;contact with B, and half the electrical fluid  
is communicated, | ſo that each has now an electrical at-  
moſphere, and therefore they repel each other, Take  
away theſe atmoſpheres by touching the balls, and leave  
them in their natural Nate: then, having fixed a ſtick of  
ſealing war to the middle of the vial to hold it by, apply  
the wire to A, at the ſamt. time the coating touches B.  
Thus will a quantity of the electrical fluid be drawn out  
of B, and thrown on A. So that A will have a redun-  
dance of this fluid, which forms an atmoſphere round it,  
and B an exact equal deficiency. Now bring theſe  
balls again into contact, and the electrical atmoſphere  
Will not be divided between A and B, into two ſmaller  
atmoſpheres as before ; for B will drink up the whole at-

it takes, becauſe it is attracted by all parts of the ſurface of  
the body, tho it cannot enter the ſubſtance already replete.  
Without this attraction it would not remain round the bo-

more eaſily drawn off from any one part of the here dun  
from another, becauſe it is equally attracted by every part,  
But that is not the caſe with bodies of any other figure.  
From a cube it is more eaſily drawn at the corners thun at  
the plane ſides, and ſo from the angles of a body of any  
other form, and ſtill moſt eaſily from the angle chat is  
moſt acute. Thus ifa body ſhaped a8 A, B, C, D, E in Fig. 8,  
be electrified, or have an electrical atmoſphere communi-  
cated to it, and we confider&#x27;every fide as a baſe on which  
the particles reſt and by which they are attracted, one  
may ſee, by imagining a line from A to F, and another  
from E to G, that the portion of the atmoſphere inchudet  
in F, A, E, G, has the line A, E, for its baſis. 80 the por-  
tion of atmoſphere included in H, A, B, I, has the line  
A, B, for its baſis. And likewiſe the portion inclu-  
ded in K, B, C, L, has B, C, to reſt on; and ſo  
on the other ſide of the figure. Now if you would  
draw off this atmoſphere with any blunt ſmooth body,  
and approach the middle of the fide A, B, you muſt come  
very near before the force of your attracter exceeds the  
force or power with which that ſide holds its atmoſphere.  
But there is a ſmall portion between I, B,K, that has leſs of  
the ſurface to reſt on, and to be attracted by, than the neigh-  
bouring portions, while at che ſame time there is a mutual  
repulſion between its particles and the particlesofthoſe por-  
tions, therefore here you can get it with more eaſe or at A  
greater diſtance. Between F, A, H, there is a larger por-  
tion that has yet a bt ſurface to reſt on and to attract it;

_ eaſieſt of all between L, C, M, where the quantity is lar-  
geſt, and the ſurface to attract and keep it back the leaſt.  
When you have drawn away one of theſe angular porti-  
ons of the fluid, another ſucceeds in its place, from the  
  
nature of fluidity and the mutual repulſion bef  
  
ed; and ſo the atmoſphere continues flowing off at fuch  
angle, like a ſtream, till no more is remaining, The ex-  
tremities of the portions of atmoſphere over theſe angular  
parts are likewiſe at a greater diſtance from the electrified  
body, as may be ſeen by the inſpection of the above figure;  
the point of the atmoſphere of the angle C, being much  
farther from C, than any other part of the atmoſphere over  
the lines C, B, or B, A: And beſides the diſtance ariſing  
from the nature of the figure, where the attraction is leſs,  
the particles will naturally expand to a greater diſtance by  
their mutual repulſion. On theſe accounts we ſuppoſe e-  
lectrified bodies diſcharge their atmoſpheres upon unelec-  
trified bodies more eaſily and at a greater diſtance: from  
their angles and points than from their ſmooth ſides.—  
  
/ Thoſe points will alſo diſcharge into the air, when the bo-  
dy has too great an electrical atmoſphere, without bring-  
ing any non- electric near, to receive what is thrown: off:  
For the air; though an electric per fe, yet has always more  
  
or leſs water and other non- electric matters mixed with it;  
and theſe attract and receive what is. ſo diſcharged, -- . --  
17. But points have a property, by which they drau on  
  
as well as throw g the electrical fluid, at greater diſtances  
a] T I | than  
  
IS Mr B. PRAKK LIN  
  
than blunt bodies can. That is, as e  
electrified body will diſcharge the atmoſphere of that bo-  
dy, or communicate it fartheſt to another body, ſo the  
point of an unelectrified body, will draw off che electrical  
atmoſphere from an eleQrified body, farther than a Hlunter  
part of the ſame unele&amp;rified body will do- Thus a pin  
held by the head, and the point preſented: to-an electri ſied  
body, will draw off: its atmoſphere at 2 foot diſtance ;  
where if the head were preſented inſtrad of the point, no  
ſuch effect would follow, To underſtand this, we may  
conſider, that if a perſon ſtanding on the floor would  
draw off the electrical atmoſphere from an electriſied bo-  
dy, an iron crow and a blunt knitting kneedle held alter  
nately in his hand and preſented for that purpoſe, do not  
drawy with different forces in proportion to their different  
maſſes.” For the man, and what he holds in his hand, be  
it large or ſmall, are connected with the common maſs  
of unelectrified matter; and the force with which he  
Aravus is the ſame in both caſes, it conſiſting in the dite /

pottioned to the ſurface over which the particles are pla-

| atmoſphere with four times the force that one ſquare inch.  
retains its atmoſphere. And as in plucking the: hairs from.

18. Theſe explanations of the power and operation of  
points, when” they firſt occutr&#x27;d to me, and while they  
firſt floated in my mind, appeared perfectly ſatisfactory;  
but now 1 have wrote them, and conſider d them more  
cloſely in black and white, I muſt own I have ſome  
doubts about them: yet as I have at preſent nothing bet-

20. Thus in the preſent cafe, to know this power of  
  
  
we ſhould never be able to explain it. The following  
experiments, -as well as thoſe in my firſt paper, ſhow this  
power. I have a large prime conductor made of ſeveral  
thin ſheets of Fuller&#x27;s paſteboard form d into a tube, near  
10 feet long and a foot diameter. It is coverd with

metallic ſurface ſupports a much greater « electrieal atmoſ  
phere than a rod of iron of 50 times the Weight would  
do. It is ſuſpended by filk lines, and when charged will.  
ſtrike at near two inches diſtance; a pretty hard ſtroke  
ſo as to make one&#x27;s knuckle ach. Let a perſon ſtanding  
on the floor preſent the point of a needle at 12 or more  
inches diſtance from it, and while the needle is ſo pre-  
ſented, the conductor cannot be charged, the point draw-.  
ing off the fire as faſt as it is thrown on by the electrical  
globe. Let it be charged, and then preſent the point at  
the ſame diſtance, and it will ſuddenly be diſcharged. In  
the dark you may ſee a light on the point, when the ex-  
periment is made. And if the perſon holding the point,  
| ſtands upon wax, he will be electrified by receiving the  
fire at that diſtance. Attempt to draw off the electricity  
with a blunt body, as a bolt of iron raund at the end and  
ſmooth (a ſilverſmith&#x27;s iron punch, inch-thick, is what I  
uſe) and you muſt bring it within the diſtance of three  
inches before you can do it, and then it is done with a  
ſtroke and crack. As the paſteboard tube hangs looſe on  
filk lines, when you approach it with the punch iron, it  
likewiſe will move towards the punch, being attracted  
while it is charged; but if at the ſame inſtant a point  
be preſented as before, it retires: again, for the point diſ-  
charges it. Take a pair of large braſs.ſcales, of two or  
more feet beam, the cords of the ſcales being ſilk. Suſ-  
pend the beam by a packthread from the cieling, ſo that  
the bottom of dhe Jeales may: be about a foot from the  
floor:  
  
. n  
  
PR r: 18 ſeales will move round i in a circle, by the un-  
weng af dhe packthread, Set the iron punch on the.  
end upon the floor, in ſuch a place as that the ſcales may  
paſs over it in making their cirele: Then electrify one  
ſcale by applying the wire of a charged phial to it. As  
they moye round, you ſee that ſcale draw nigher to the  
floor, and dip more when it comes over the punch; and ;  
il chat be placed at @ proper diſtance, the ſcale will ſnap,  
and diſcharge its fire into it. But if a needle be ſtuck.  
on the end of the punch, its point upwards, the ſcale,  
inſtead. of drawing nigh to the punch. and ſnapping, dis-  
charges its fire ſilently through the point, and riſes high-  
er from the punch. Nay, even if the needle be placed  
upon. the floor near the punch, its point upwards, the;  
end of the punch, tho ſo much higher than the needle,  
will not attract the ſcale and receive its fire, for the needle.  
will get it and convey it away, before it comes nigh e-  
nough for the punch to act. And this. is conſtantly ob-  
ſervable in theſe experiments, that the greater quantity |  
of electricity on the paſteboard tube, the farther it ſtrikes -  
or diſcharges its fire, and the point likewiſe will draw it  
off at a ſtill greater diſtance. _...- _ | 0

at 4 proportionably greater diſtance.” The horizontal mo-  
tion of the ſcales over the floor, may repreſent the mo-  
tion of the clouds over the earth; and the erect iron  
punch, a hill or high building; Ke then we ſee how  
e eee over hills or high buildings at  
too great a height to ſtrike, may be attracted lower till  
within their ftriking diſtance. And laftly, if à needle  
fix&#x27;d on the punch with its point upright, or even on the  
floor below the punch, will draw the fire from the ſcale  
filently at a much greater than the ſtriking diſtance,  
ſo prevent its deſcending towards the punch; or if in  
courſe it would have come nigh enough to ſtrike, yet be-  
ing firſt deprived of its fire it cannot, and the punch is  
thereby ſecured from the ſtroke. I ſay, F theſe things  
are To, may not the knowledge of this power of points  
be of uſe to mankind, in preſerving houſes, churches,  
thips, &amp;c. from the ſtroke of lightning, by directing us  
to fix on the higheſt parts of thoſe edifices, upright rods  
of jron made ſharp as a needle, and gilt to prevent ruſt-  
  
  
-outlide of the building into the ground, or down round  
one of the ſhrouds of a ſhip, and down her fide&quot; tilt it  
reaches the water? Would not theſe pointed rods proba-  
  
bly draw the electrical fire filently out of a &lt;loud before  
  
  
that moſt ſudden and terrible miſchief ?  
21. To determine the queſtion, e e  
| that  
  
Luvtuns on — 63  
  
that contain ligbening are electrified or not, I would pro- |  
poſe an experiment to be try&#x27;d where it may be done conve-  
niently: ¶ On the top of ſome high tower or ſteeple, place a  
kind of ſentry-box; (as in F16.9.) big enough to contain a  
man and an electrical ſtand. From the middle of the ſtand,  
let an iron rod rife and paſs bending out of the door, and  
then upright 20 or 30 feet; pointed very ſharp at the end.  
If the electrical Rand be kept clean and dry, a man  
ſtanding on it when ſuch clouds are paſſing low, might  
| be cleftrified and afford ſparks, the rod drawing fire  
to him from a cloud. If any danger to the man ſhould  
be apprehended (though I think there would be none)  
let him ſtand. on the floor of his box, and now! and then  
bring near to the rod, the loop of a wire that das one  
end faſtened to the leads, he holding it by a wax handle;  
ſo tha ſparks, if the rod is ele&amp;rified, will ſtrike from  
the rad. to tha wire, and not affect hin.  
  
22. Before I leave this ſubject of elne  
tian ſome other ſimilarities between the effects of that,  
and theſe of electricity. Lightning has often been known  
to ſtrike people. blind. A pigeon that we ſtruck dead to  
appearance by the.elecrical ſhock, recovering life, droop&#x27;d  
about the yard ſeveral days, eat nothing though crumbs

try the effect of a ſtrong electrical flaſh ſent through that  
gold from a charged ſheet of glaſs. But having no paint  
at hand, I paſted a narrow ſtrip of paper over it; and  
when dry, ſent the flaſh&quot;through the gilding; by which  
the paper was torn off from end to end, with ſuch force,  
that it was broke in ſeveral places, and 1 in others brought  
away part of the grain of the Turky- leather in which  
it was bound; and convinced me, that had it been paint-

ſorniewhat reddith ; fllver, a preeniſh Nuit. We once took  
  
two pieces of thick Tooking-glzfs, as broad as a Gunter  
  
ſcale, and b&#x27;inches long; and placing leaf god betwern  
dem, put them betwixt Two finoothly plain u pieces of  
wood, 184 nd them tight in a book-binder&#x27;s finall preſs;  
yet though they were f6 cloſely confined, the forte of the  
electrical ſhock Thivered the glaſs into many pieces. The  
gold wis melted and ftain&#x27;d into the glaſs as uſual. The  
  
circumſtances of the breaking of the glaſs differ much  
in making the experiment, and ſometimes it does not  
break at all: but this is conſtant, that the ſtains in the  
  
upper and under pieces are exact of each o-  
  
ther. And though 1 have taken up de of glaſt  
  
between my fingers immediately after this melting, I ne-  
  
To could perceive the leaſt warmth in then.

| Ming on a bock, though at firſt it cotamunicated the  
| ſhock perfectly well, yet fail&#x27;d after a few experiments,  
  
which we could not account for. We have finee found,  
  
that one ſtrong ſhock breaks the continuity of the gold  
in the filleting, and makes it look rather like duſt of  
gold, abundance of its parts being broken and driven off;  
and it will ſeldom condudt above one ſtrong ſhock. Per-  
haps this may be the reaſon ; when there is not a perfect  
continuity in the circle, the fire muſt leap over the va-  
cancies ; there is a certain diſtance which it is able to  
leap over according to its ſtrength ; if a number of

till” it comes to a [diſtance where the diſcharge ch beet  
actly equal to the receipt, the latter being leſſened, and  
che former enereaſedi and there it remains as long - 88 the  
globe continues to ſupply freſh electrical matter. This  
will appear plain, when the difference of acuteneſs in  
the corners is made very great. Cut a piece of Ditch |  
gold (which is fitteſt-for theſe experiments on account of  
its greater ſtrength) into the form of Fi. 10 the up-  
per corner a right angle, the two next obtuſe angles,  
and the loweſt a very acute one; and- bring this on your  
plate under the electrified plate, in ſuch a manner as  
that the richt-angled part may be firſt raiſed (which is  
done by covering the acute part wich de hollow of your  
hand) and you will ſee this leaf take place much nearer  
to the upper than to the under plate; becauſe, without  
being nearer, it cannot - receive ſo . ſaſt at its right-angled  
point, as it can diſcharge at its acute one. Turn this  
leaf with the acute part uppermoſt, and then it takes  
place neareſt the unelectrified plate, becauſe otherwiſe  
| it receives faſter at its acute point than it &#x27;can&#x27; diſcharge -  
4 at its right-angled one. Thus the difference of diſtance  
is always proportioned to the difference of acuteneſs.  
Take care in cutting your leaf to leave no little ragged |  
particles on the edges, which ſometimes form points  
TO you would not have them. &quot;You: mee n this

we call it the Golden&quot; Piſh,&#x27; froth it inanner of acting. For  
if ya take it by te tall, and hold ir at 4 foot « or greater  
horizontal diſtanee from the prime conductor, it will,  
then let go, fly to it with a briſſe but wavering motion,  
like that of an eel through the water; it will then take  
place under the prime conductor, at perhaps a quarter  
or half an inch diſtance, and keep a continual ſhaking of  
its tall like a fiſh, ſo that it ſeems animated. au wi  
towards the prime conductor, and then it flies to your  
finger, and ſeems to nibble it. And if you hold a plate  
under it at fix or eight inches diſtince, and ceaſe turning  
the Globe, when the electrical atmoſphere of the conduc-  
tor grows ſmall, it will deſcend to the plate and ſwim back  
again ſeveral times with tlie fame fiſh-like motion, greatly  
to the entertainment of ſpectators. By a little practice in  
blunting or ſharpening the heads or tails of theſe figures,  
you may make them e eee delived,: 8 &quot;oinn

27. It is faid in ſection 8, of this paper, that eth of  
common matter are ſuppoſed not to attra&amp;t the electrical  
fluid with equal ſtrength ; and that thoſe called electrics  
ger ſe, as glaſs, &amp;c. attract and retain i it ſtrongeſt; and con-  
tain the greateſt quantity. This latter &#x27;poſition may ſeem  
a paradox to ſome, being contrary to the hitherto received  
opinion; and therefore I ſhall now endeavour to explain it.

28 In order to this, let it firſt he confidered, thet wo  
cannot, by any means ut arg pet acquainted with. foree the e  
lectrical fluid thro&#x27; glaſt. I know it is ej thaught  
  
that it eaſily pervades glaſs, and the expetiment of « ſtather  
&#x27; ſaſpended by à thread in a hole hermetically ſoaked, yet  
moved by bringing a nibbed tube naar the aùtſide of tha  
bottle, is alledged-to&#x27;prove it. But, if the electrical fluid  
ſo eafily pervades glaſe, how does the vial become cher.  
ged (as we term it) when wo hald it in our hands?  
Would not the fire thrown in by the wire paſs through  
to our hands, and ſo eſcape into the floor? Would not  
the bottle in that caſe be left juſt as we found it, unchar-  
ged. as we know a metal battle ſa attempted to be char-  
ed would be? Indeed, if there be the leaſt crack, the  
minuteſt ſalution of continuity in the glaſs, though it re-  
mains ſa tight that nothing elſe we know of will paſs, yet  
the extremely ſubtile electrical fluid flies through ſuch  
à crack with the greateſt freedom, and ſuch a bottle we  
know can never be charged: What then makes the diffe-  
rence between ſuch a bottle and one that is ſound, but this,  
that the fluid can paſs through the one, and not through  
the other? ® _

the glaſs. It is this : place the bottle on a glaſs ſtand, un-  
der the prime conductor ; ſuſpend a bullet by a chain from  
the ptime conductor, till it comes within a quarter of an  
inch right over the wire of the bottle; place your knuc-  
kle on the glaſs ſtand, at juſt the ſame diſtance from the  
coating of the bottle, as the bullet is from its wire. Now  
let the globe de turned, and you fee 2 ſpark ſtrike from  
you fee and feel an exactly equal fpark ſtriking from the  
doating on your knuckle, and fo on ſpark for ſpark. This  
looks as if the whole received by the bottle was again diſ-  
charged from it. And yet the bottle by this means is  
charged! And therefore the fire that thus leaves the  
bottle, though the ſame in quantity, cannot be the very  
ſume fire that entered at the wire; for if it were, the bot- -  
tle would remain uncharged.  
10. IF the fv that fo leaves the bottle be not the ume  
that is thrown in through the wire, it muſt be ficethat ſub-  
ſiſted in the bottle, (that is, in the glaſs of the bottle) be-  
fore the operation began. |  
&quot;i If fo, there maſt be a great quantity in glaſs, be-

neee ſphere than

But that is not the caſe with bodies of any other figure.  
From a cube it is more eaſily drawn at the corners than  
at the plane ſides, and ſo from the angles of a body of any  
other form, and ſtill moſt eaſily from the angle that is  
moſt acute. Thus if a body ſhaped as A, B, C, D, E, in Fig. 8.  
be electrified, or have an electrical atmoſphere communi-  
cated to it, and we conſider every ſide as a baſe on which  
the particles reſt, and by which they are attracted, one  
may ſee, by imagining a line from A to F, and another  
from E to G, that the portion of the atmoſphere included  
in F, A, E, G, has the line A, E, for its baſis. So the por-  
tion of atmoſphere included in H, A, B, I, has the line  
A, B, for its baſis. And likewiſe. the portion included  
in K, B, C, L, has B, C, to reſt on; and ſo on the  
other ſide of the figure. Now if you would draw off  
this atmoſphere with any blunt ſmooth body, and ap-  
proach the middle of the fide A, B,, you muſt! come  
very near before the force of your attracter exceeds the  
force or power with which that fide holds its. atmoſphere.  
But there is a ſmall portion between I, B, K, that has leſs of  
the ſarface to reſt on, and to-be.attracted by, than the neigh-  
. bouring portions, while at the ſame time there is a mutual

that blunt bodies can. That is, as the pointed part of an  
or communicate it fartheſt to another body, ſo the point  
of an unelectrified body, will draw off the electrical atmo-  
ſphere from an eleftrified body, farther than a blunter part  
of the ſame unelectriſied body will do. Thus a pin held  
by the head, and the point preſented to an electriſied body,  
A e ns ere a = b where, if  
the head were preſented inſtead of the point, no ſuch effect  
would follow. To underſtand this, we may conſider,  
that if a perſon ſtanding on the floor would draw off the  
crow and a blunt knitting-needle held alternately in his  
hand and preſented for that purpoſe, do not draw with  
different&quot; forces in proportion to their different maſſes.  
For the man, and what he holds in his hand, be it large  
or ſmall, are connected with the common maſs of un-  
electriſied matter; and the force with which he draws is  
the ſame in both caſes, it confiſting in the different pro  
portion of elefricity in the electriſied body and that com-  
mon&#x27;mafs.” But the force with which the elefrified body  
retains its atmoſphere by attracting it, is proportioned to  
the ſurface&#x27;over which the particles are placed; i. e. four  
ſquare inches of that furface retain their atmoſphere with  
four times the force that one ſquare inch retains its at-  
moſphere. © And as in plucking the hairs from the horſe&#x27;s

likewiſe will move towards the punch, being attracted

ſcale by applying the wire of a charged phial to it. As  
they move round, you ſee that ſcale draw nigher to the  
floor, and dip more when it comes over the punch; and  
if that be placed at a proper diſtance, the ſcale will ſnap  
and diſcharge its fire into it. But if a needle be ſtuck on

thereby ſecured from the ſtroke. I fay, if theſe things

that contain lightning are electrified or not, I would pro-  
poſe an experiment to be try&#x27;d where it may be done con-  
vehiently. On the top of ſome high tower or ſteeple, place  
a kind of ſentry- box, (as in F16. 9.) big enough to contain  
a man and an electrical ſtand. From the middle of the ſtand,  
let an iron rod riſe and paſs bending out of the door, and  
then upright 20 or 30 feet, pointed very ſharp at the end.  
If the electrical ſtand be kept clean and dry, a man ſtand-  
ing on it when ſuch clouds are paſſing low, might be clec-  
a cloud. If any danger to the man ſhould be apprehended  
though I think there would be none) let him ſtand on  
the floor of his box, and now and then bring near to the  
rod the loop of a wire that has one-end faſtened to the  
leads, he holding it by a wax handle; fo the ſparks, if  
the rod is eleQrified, will ſtrike from Ry  
and not affect him. 2  
22. Before I leave this object of aw: T may men-  
tion ſome other ſimilarities between the effects of that,  
and theſe of electricity. Lightning has &#x27;often been known  
to ſtrike people blind. A pigeon that we ſtruck dead to  
appearance by the electrical ſhock, recovering lite, droop&#x27;d  
about the yard ſeveral days, eat nothing though crumbs  
were-thrown to it, but-declined and died. We did not  
think of its being deprived of ſight; but afterwards a  
pullet ſtruck dead in like manner, being recovered by re-  
peatedly blowing into its lungs, when ſet down&#x27;on the  
n E wall, and on examination  
£ appeared  
  
64 Mr B. FRANKLIN&quot;  
  
appeared perfectly blind. Hence we concluded that the  
pigeon alſo had been abſolately blinded by the ſhock.  
The biggeſt animal we have yet killed or try&#x27;d to kill  
with the electrical ſtroke, was a well-grown pullet..  
  
23. Reading in the ingenious Dr. Hales&#x27;s account of  
the thunder ſtorm at Stretham, the effect of the lightning  
in ſtripping off all the paint that had covered à gilt  
  
  
reſt of the paint, I had a mind to lay a coat of paint over  
the filleting of gold on the cover of a. book, and try the  
effect of a ſtrong electrical flaſh ſent through that gold  
from a charged ſheet of glaſs. But having no paint at  
  
  
_ dry, ſent the flaſh through the gilding ; by which the paper  
&gt;; eee roms end to end, with ſuch force, that it was  
broke in ſeveral places, and in others brought away part of  
the grain of the Turky-leather in which it was bound ;  
and convinced me, that had it been painted, the paint  
would have bran Bags 7 the loan Manger. with that  
on the wainſcot at Stretham.  
24. Lightning melts metals, and 1 hinted in my maer  
on that ſubject, that I ſuſpected it to be a cold fuſion;  
7 mean a fuſion by force of cold, but a fuſion  
without heat. We have alſo melted gold, ſilver, and  
copper, in ſmall quantities, by the electrical flaſh. The  
manner is this : Take leaf gold, leaf filyer, or leaf gilt  
copper, commonly called leaf braſs, or Dureh gold:

 The particles  
of the electrical fluid have a mutual repellency, but by the  
power of attraction in the glaſs they are condenſed or  
forced nearer to each other. When the glaſs has received,  
and, by its attraction, forced cloſer together ſo much of  
this electrical fluid, as that the power of attracting and  
condenſing in the one, is equal to the power of expanſion  
in the other, it can imbibe no more, and that remains its  
conſtant whole quantity; but each ſurface would receive  
more, if the repellencey of what is in the oppoſite ſurface  
did not refiſt its entrance. The quantities of this fluid in  
each ſurface being equal, their repelling action on each  
other is equal ; and therefore thoſe of one ſurface cannot  
drive out thoſe of the other : but, if a greater quantity is  
forced into one ſurface than the glaſs would naturally  
draw in; this increaſes the repelling power on that fide,  
and overpowering the attraction on the other, drives out  
part of the fluid that had been imbibed by that ſurface, if  
there be any non - electric ready to receive it: ſuch there is  
in all caſes where glaſs is electriſied to give a ſhock. The  
ſurſace that has been thus emptied by having its electrical  
fluid driven out, refumes again an equal quantity with vio-  
lence, as ſoon as the glaſs has an opportunity to diſcharge  
that over quantity more than it could retain by attraction  
in its other ſurface, by the additional repellency of which  
the vacuum had been OTE, For experiments fa-

perhaps its elaſticity may be owing in ſome degree to the  
ſubſiſting of ſo great a quantity of this repelling fluid  
in its pores) muſt, when rubbed, have its rubbed&#x27; ſur-  
face ſomewhat ſtretched, or its ſolid parts drawn a little  
  
farther aſunder, ſo that the vacancies in which the elec-  
trical fluid reſides, become larger, affording room for  
more of that fluid, which is immediately attracted into it  
  
  
from the common ſtock. But the inſtant the parts of the

ditional repelleney of che electrical fluid, thus collected |  
by friction on the rubb&#x27;d part of the globe&#x27;s outer ſur-  
face, drives an equal quantity out of the inner ſurface into  
that non-eleric lining, which receiving it, and carrying  
it away from the rubb&#x27;d part into the common maſs,  
through the axis of; thi glabe &#x27;and Enron. of ge: ma-  
chine, the new collected electrical fluid can enter and re-  
main in the outer ſurface, and none of it (or a very little)  
will be received by the prime conductor. As this charg d  
part of the globe comes round to the cuſhion again, the  
outer ſurface delivers its overplus fire into the cuſhion, the  
oppolite inner ſurface receiving at the ſame time an equal  
quantity from the floor. Every electrician knows that a  
globe wet within will afford little or no fire, but the rea-  
ſon has not before been ANTE to be SO 1

little or no fire is obtained from it. What is collected  
from the hand in the downward rubbing ſtroke, entering  
the potes of the glaſs, and driving an equal quantity out  
of the inner ſurface into the non- electric lining: and the  
hand in paſſing up to take a ſecond ſtroke, takes out  
again what had been thrown into the outer ſurface, and.  
then the inner ſurface receives back again what it had

the inner ſurface, without a non; electric conductor:  
but air reſiſts its motion; for being itſelf an electric per  
ſe, it does not attract it, having already its quantity. 80  
the air never draws off an electric atmoſphere from any  
body, but in proportion to the non- electrics mix&#x27;d with  
it: it rather keeps ſuch an atmoſphere confin&#x27;d, which  
from the mutual repulſion of its particles, tends to diſſi-  
pation, and would immediately diflipate in vacus.—And  
thus the experiment of the feather incloſed in a [glaſs  
veſſel hermetically ſealed, but moving on the approach  
of the rubbed tube, is explained: When an additional  
quantity of the electrical fluid is applied to the fide of  
the veſſel by the atmoſphere of the tube, a quantity is  
  
  
withdrawn; not that the particles of that atmoſphere did

at the ſame time to the other ſurface; ſo that the whole  
glaſs may always have the ſame quantity in the two fut-

And this can only be done in glaſs that is thin; beyond

“Take a pair of large brass scales, of two or more feet beam, the  
cords of the scales being silk. Suspend the beam by a packthread  
from the ceiling, so that the bottom of the scales may be about a foot  
from the floor; the scales will move round in a circle by the untwisting  
of the packthread. Let an iron punch (a silversmith’s iron punch, an  
inch thick, is what I use) be put on the end upon the floor, in such a  
place as that the scales may pass over it in making their circle ; then  
electrify one scale by applying the wire of a charged phial to it. As  
they move round, you see that scale draw nigher to the floor, and dip  
more when it comes over the punch ; and, if that be placed at a proper  
distance, the scale will snap, and discharge its fire into it. But if a  
needle be stuck on the end of the punch, its point upwards, the scale,  
instead of drawing nigh to the punch and snapping, discharges its fire  
silently through the point, and rises higher from the punch. Nay, even  
if the needle be placed upon the floor near the punch, its point upwards,  
the end of the punch, though so much higher than the needle, will not  
attract the scale and receive its fire, for the needle will get it, and con-

ten feet long will strike and discharge its fire on the punch at two or  
three inches distance, an electrified cloud of perhaps ten thousand acres  
may strike and discharge on the earth at a proportionally greater dis-  
tance. The horizontal motion of the scales over the floor may represent  
the motion of the clouds over the earth, and the erect punch a hill or  
high building; and then we see how electrified clouds, passing over  
hills or high buildings at too great a height to strike, may be attracted  
lower till within their striking distance. And, lastly, if a needle fixed  
on the punch with its point upright, or even on the floor below the  
punch, will draw the fire from the scale silently at a much greater than  
the striking distance, and so prevent its descending towards the punch ;  
or if in its course it would have come nigh enough to strike, yet, being  
first deprived of its fire, it cannot, and the punch is thereby secured  
from the stroke; I say, if these things are so, may not the knowledge  
of this power of points be of use to mankind in preserving houses,  
churches, ships, &amp;c. from the stroke of lightning, by directing us to fix,  
on the highest parts of those edifices, upright rods of iron, made sharp  
as a needle, and gilt to prevent rusting; and from the foot of those rods,  
a wire down the outside of the building into the ground, or down round  
one of the shrouds of a ship, and down her side till it reaches the water ?  
Would not these pointed rods probably draw the electrical fire silently  
out of a cloud before it came mgh enough to strike, and thereby secure  
us from that most sudden and terrible mischief ?”  
  
“To determine this question, whether the clouds that contain light-  
ning be electrified or not, | would propose an experiment to be tried,  
where it may be done conveniently. On the top of some high tower,  
or steeple, place a kind of sentry box, big enough to contain a man and  
an electrical stand. From the middle of the stand let an iron rod rise,  
and pass, bending, out of the door, and then upright twenty or thirty  
feet, pointed very sharp at the end. If the electrical stand be kept  
clear and dry, a man standing on it, when such clouds are passing low,  
might be electrified, and afford sparks, the rod drawing fire to him from  
acloud. If any danger to the man be apprehended, let him stand on  
the floor of his box, and now and then bring near to the rod the loop  
of a wire that has one end fastened to the leads, he holding it by a wax  
handle; so the sparks, if the rod is electrified, will strike from the rod  
to the wire, and not affect him.’’*

fied body more rapidly than a blunt one. He suspended a scale-  
beam by a pack-thread from the ceiling of a room, and to the ends  
of the beam he attached a pair of large brass scales by silk  
cords. One of the scales was electrified, and an iron punch was  
set on the end upon the floor. The scales moved round in a  
circle by the untwisting of the pack-thread ; and when the charged  
scale came over the punch, it dipped toward it, and discharged its  
electricity in the form of a spark. But when a needle was fastened  
to the end of the punch, the electricity was discharged silently,  
without the scale dipping toward the point.  
  
Now, says Franklin, if the fire of electricity, and that of light-  
  
ning, be the same, as I have endeavored to show at large in a  
  
former paper, these scales may represent electrified clouds. The  
horizontal motion of the scales over the floor may represent the  
motion of the clouds over the earth; and the erect iron punch, a  
hill or high building; and then we see how electrified clouds,  
passing over hills or high buildings at too great a height to strike,  
may be attracted lower, till within their striking distance. And if  
a needle, fixed on the punch with its point upright, will draw the  
fire from the scale silently, at a much greater than the striking  
distance, may not the knowledge of this power of points be of  
some use to mankind in preserving houses, churches, and ships  
from lightning? Would not pointed rods of metal, extending from  
the highest parts of those edifices to the earth or water, probably  
draw the electrical fire silently out of a cloud before it came near  
enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and  
terrible mischief ?*  
  
So fully is this sagacious man possessed of the idea that light-  
ning is electricity, that he immediately proceeds to describe the  
experiment by which their identity may be demonstrated. His  
directions are as follows :—  
  
“On the top of some high tower, or steeple, place a kind of sentry-  
box, big enough to contain a man and an electrical stand. From the  
middle of the stand let an iron rod rise and pass, bending out of the  
  
door, and then upright, twenty or thirty feet, pointed very sharp at the  
end. Ifthe electrical stand be kept clean and dry, a man standing on

it to give a spark at the distance of two inches,  
strong enough, as he said, “to make one’s

a needle to the conductor, at more than a foot

“ Hence we see the impossibility of success in the experi-

electric, as cinnamon, for instance, and mixing them with  
the electric fluid, to convey them with that into the body,

fluid should mix within the globe, they would never come  
out together through the pores of the glass, and so go to the

through ; and the prime conductor is always supplied from

Even before the identity of electricity and

of buildings. “If these things are so,” he  
argued as early as 1749, “may not the know-

mankind, in preserving houses, churches,  
ships, &amp;c from the stroke of lightning, by  
directing us to fix, on the highest parts of  
those edifices, upright rods of iron made  
sharp as a needle, and gilt to prevent rust-  
ing, and from the foot of those rods a wire  
down the outside of the building into the  
ground, or down round one of the shrouds  
of a ship, and down her side till it reaches  
the water? Would not these pointed rods
