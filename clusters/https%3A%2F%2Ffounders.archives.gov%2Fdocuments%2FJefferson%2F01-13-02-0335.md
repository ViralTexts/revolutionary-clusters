puzzled to decide: but I hope they will have neither, and that they are advancing to a limited, moderate government, in which the people will have a good share.  
I sincerely rejoice at the acceptance of our new constitution by nine states. It is a good canvas, on which some strokes only want retouching. What these are, I think are sufficiently manifested by the general voice from North to South, which calls for a bill of rights. It seems pretty generally understood that this should go to Juries, Habeas corpus, Standing armies, Printing, Religion and Monopolies. I conceive there may be difficulty in finding general modification of these suited to the habits of all the states. But if such cannot be found then it is better to establish trials by jury, the right of Habeas corpus, freedom of the press and freedom of religion in all cases, and to abolish standing armies in time of peace, and Monopolies, in all cases, than not to do it in any. The few cases wherein these things may do evil, cannot be weighed against the multitude wherein the want of them will do evil. In disputes between a foreigner and a native, a trial by jury may be improper. But if this exception cannot be agreed to, the remedy will be to model the jury by giving the medietas linguae in civil as well as criminal cases. Why suspend the Hab. corp. in insurrections and rebellions? The parties who may be arrested may be charged instantly with a well defined crime. Of course the judge will remand them. If the publick safety requires that the government should have a man imprisoned on less probable testimony in those than in other emergencies; let him be taken and tried, retaken and retried, while the necessity continues, only giving him redress against the government for damages. Examine the history of England: see how few of the cases of the suspension of the Habeas corpus law have been worthy of that suspension. They have been either real treasons wherein the parties might as well have been charged at once, or sham-plots where it was shameful they should ever have been suspected. Yet for the few cases wherein the suspension of the hab. corp. has done real good, that operation is now become habitual, and the minds of the nation almost prepared to live under it’s constant suspension. A declaration that the federal government will never restrain the presses from printing any thing they please, will not take away the liability of the printers for false facts printed. The declaration that religious faith shall be unpunished, does not give impunity to criminal acts dictated by religious  error. The saying there shall be no monopolies lessens the incitements to ingenuity, which is spurred on by the hope of a monopoly for a limited time, as of 14. years; but the benefit even of limited monopolies is too doubtful to be opposed to that of their general suppression. If no check can be found to keep the number of standing troops within safe bounds, while they are tolerated as far as necessary, abandon them altogether, discipline well the militia, and guard the magazines with them. More than magazine-guards will be useless if few, and dangerous if many. No European nation can ever send against us such a regular army as we need fear, and it is hard if our militia are not equal to those of Canada or Florida. My idea then is, that tho’ proper exceptions to these general rules are desireable and probably practicable, yet if the exceptions cannot be agreed on, the establishment of the rules in all cases will do ill in very few. I hope therefore a bill of rights will be formed to guard the people against the federal government, as they are already guarded against their state governments in most instances.  
The abandoning the principle of necessary rotation in the Senate, has I see been disapproved by many; in the case of the President, by none. I readily therefore suppose my opinion wrong, when opposed by the majority as in the former instance, and the totality as in the latter. In this however I should have done it with more complete satisfaction, had we all judged from the same position.

ditications of thefe, fuited to the habits of all the ftates. But if fag,  
cannot be found, then it isbetter to eftablith trials by jury, the righ

cafes, and to abolifh ttanding armies in time of peace, and Monopolies  
in all cafes, than not todo it inany. The few cafes wherein thef  
things may do evil cannot be weighed againft the multitude whereiy  
the want of them will do evil.  
  
in difputes between a foreigner anda native, atrial by jury ma  
be improper ; but if this exception cannot be agreed to, the remedy  
will be, to model the jury, by giving the medietas lingue in civil,»  
well as in criminal cafes.  
  
Why fafpend the habeas corpus in’ infurreions and rebellions!  
The partics who may bearrefted, may be charged inftantly with a well  
defined crime; of courfe, the judge will remand them : if the public  
fafety requires that the government fhould have a man impritoned a  
Jeis probable teitimony, in thofe than in other emergencies, let bimbe  
taken and tried, retaken and retried, while the neceflity continues,  
only giving bim redrefs againf{t the government for damages. Eva.  
mine the hittory of i.ngland, fee how few cafes of the fulpenfion of the  
habees corpus law have been worthy of that fufpention. They have  
been either real treatons, wherein the parties might as well bave  
beenycharged at once, or fham-plots, where it was fhameful the  
fhould ever have been fuipected. Yet forthe few cafes, wherein the  
fuipention of the habeas corpus hasdone real good, that operation is  
now become habitual, and the minds of the nation almoft prepared tw

preiics from printing any thing they pleaie, will not take away tle  
liability of the printers for falle facts printed. The declaration that  
religious faith fhall be unpunifhed, does not give impunity to crim  
nal acts dictated by religious cyror. ‘The faying there fhall be no  
monopcolies, lefiens the incitements to ingenuity, which is fpurred on  
by the hope of a monopoly for a limited time, as of ‘ourteen years:  
but the benetit, even of limited monopolies, is too doubtiul to be op  
poled to that of their general fafpention. !fno check can be found  
to keep the number of ftanding troops within tafe bounds, while they  
aretolerated as tar as neceflary, abandon them altogether ; diicipline

magazine guards will be ulelefs if tew, and dangerous if many. No  
European bation can ever fend again{t us fuch a regular army as we  
need fear, and it is hard if our militia are not equal to thofe of Canada

My idea then is, that though proper exceptions to thefe general  
rules are defirable, and probably pradicable, yet if the exceptions

questioned whether the “insurrection or rebellion,” which  
the Constitution contemplated as justifying the suspension  
of the writ, could be such a breaking in two of the Republic
