I must beg to be excused from answering the question proposed to me in your favor of the 11th inst. on the subject of the Candidates named for the next Presidency. I lay it down as a law to myself to take no part in that election. advice on such an occasion, were I even  qualified to give it, would incur a fearful responsibility.
