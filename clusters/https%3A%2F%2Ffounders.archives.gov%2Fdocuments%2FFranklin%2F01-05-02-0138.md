sed by a single particle of light, or that a single particle is equal thereto in bigness, I would ask whether the quantity of matter in such a particle would not be small in a greater degree, than its velocity (equal to that of the sun’s light) would be great? If so, a particle of light in motion may properly be supposed o, and its momentum not sufficient to remove the lightest dust, much less to do as much execution as a 24 pounder. We may go further to lessen the particles of light, by supposing that the candle

onsider your hypothesis p.265. You suppose “that all the phenomena of light may be more conveniently solved, by supposing universal space filled with a subtle elastic fluid, which when at rest is not visible, but whose vibrations affect that fine sense in the eye, as those of air do the grosser organs of the ear. We do not in the case of sound imagine that any sonorous particles are thrown off from a bell for instance, and fly in straight lines to the ear; why must we believe that luminous particles leave the sun and proceed to the eye.”  
Diverse objections occur hereto, some arising from the supposition itself, and others from the comparison of light with sound. With regard to the first — if universal space be filled with a subtle elastic fluid, that fluid would always be at rest and therefore always invisible, and of consequence there would be always universal darkness; or, if any part could be put in motion, the whole must be in motion; for one single particle of it could not move without moving the next and that the next and so on ad infinitum; and in that case the least motion, let it commence when it would, must produce universal motion, and consequently universal light: and therefore there could be no medium between universal darkness and universal light. But if we relax the sense of the expression, and suppose universal space instead of being filled to abound greatly with the elastic fluid (in which sense I apprehend you intended to be understood) would not everything, which disturbed that fluid, cause a luminous appearance? Would not the inhabitants of the sea and air bespangle both, in all their motions, and thereby like prisms, exhibit the various colors according to the degree of vibration which those motions should occasion in the elastic fluid? and, as to ourselves, would not a radiance attend us wherever we went? What occasion should we have for candle light, when a quick vibration of the hand, or of machines easy to be invented, would dispel the night? Or rather might we not suppose there would be no night at all? For the action of the sun (if the sun should be necessary) would be communicated to us notwithstanding the interposition of the earth? And would not the effect of the sun’s action be only to enlighten us, unattended with heat, which enlivens and cherishes the universe? Would it be possible to collect any heat from the sun with glasses as we now do, if it only occasioned a vibration in the elastic fluid? and would not the elastic fluid, instead of exhibiting a round luminous body which we call the sun, be itself one continued universal blaze of light? These seem to be objections arising from the hypothesis: I shall mention several, which arise from the comparison abovementioned. As sound (or a vibratory motion in the air which I would have considered here as synonymous) is propagated from the sonorous body in all directions, and surrounds and is propagated beyond or behind any obstacle in its way; so light, if it was a vibration of the elastic fluid, would surround and be propagated behind an obstacle, like sound: but this is not fact. Further, as sound confined for instance within the walls of an house, one of whose sides has an hole in it, would be propagated from that hole externally in circles, of which the hole would be the centre; so light, if it was a vibration, or was occasioned by a vibration of the elastic fluid, after passing through an hole would be propagated in circles, of which the hole would be the centre; but this is not fact; for light in its passage through the same uniform medium always passes in right lines. Besides, I am apprehensive that an objection somewhat similar to those above-mentioned against the common hypothesis, will lie against this; for the perpetual vibration, which the elastic fluid must be in, must keep light small bodies (and even a 24 pounder if suspended) in a

y we not suppose that the electric fluid is heterogeneous as well as light. The heterogeneousness of light is inferred from its colours, which are said to vary as the size of the particles vary: the variation becoming conspicuous by a prism and by other means, which class the particles according to their respective magnitudes, or degrees of refrangibility. Besides this which is the usual reason, another may be suggested from which the heterogeneousness of light may be inferred, namely, because it exhibits some effects similar to those of electricity: for example, a globe or pane of glass warmed in the sun or before a fire will attract and repel successively small cork balls, down, and such like bodies, properly circumstanced; and will shew other signs of electricity communicated to the glass by the sun or fire. So in regard to electricity its heterogeneousness may be collected from its producing some effects resembling those of light or fire, which are here considered as equivalent terms. Electricity and fire differ in many respects, and in some they agree as you have shewn in your letters on Electricity. So far as they agree in their effects, their natures may be presumed to be alike; or rather from this agreement or similitude of effects I would infer that they are mixed with and generally accompany each other; and that each produces its own effect at the time of their joint operation; the effects of electricity, similar to those of fire, being produced by the fire mixed with it; and the effects of fire, resembling those of electricity, being produced by the electricity mixed with that; the compound taking its name from the predominant principle. Thus, fire enflames bodies, and throws particles or light at a distance; hence the explosion of gun-powder and the luminous appearance occasioned by the electric spark; the fire mixed with it producing those effects. Thus, also, electricity attracts and repels light bodies alternately under given circumstances; hence the attraction and repulsion of glass heated before a fire; the electricity mixed with the fire producing those effects. In this way I would infer the heterogeneousness of light and electricity, and their mixture with each other; and in this way account for the similitude and difference of their effects; and for the luminous appearance of the electric spark in particular, without diminishing the pure electric fluid contained therein; no part of which (I am persuaded with you) flies off in the case you mention to distant places, but all goes directly, and is to be found in the place to which you destine it. On the same principles, the shining of diamonds in the dark, when rubbed and thereby electrified, may be accounted for without supposing that they lose any part of their matter.

Several objections here prefent themfelves. Some of them  
arifing from the hypothefis itfelf ; and others from the com-

In refpeé&amp;t of the former, if univerfal {pace be filled with a fub-  
tle elaftic fluid, (fo as to exclude any vacuum) that fluid muft  
always be at reft, and therefore by the hypothefis always invi-  
fible ; and confequently there would always be univerfal dark-  
nefs. Or if any part of the fluid could be put in motion, the  
whole of it muft be in motion : for not one particle of it  
could move,, without moving, in the dire¢tion of its motion,  
the adjoining one, and this the next ; and fo on, ad infinitum.  
In this cafe, the. leaft motion, wherever it might commence,  
muft produce univerfal motion ; and confequently, univerfal

there would be no night at all? for the action of the fun (if  
the fun fhould be neceflary) would be communicated to us,  
notwithftanding the interpofition of the earth. And would  
not the effect of that action, even at noon when mott direct,  
be only to enlighten us, unattended with Heat, fo eflentially  
neceflary to enliven and invigorate the animal and vegetable  
world ?—Would not the elaftic fluid, inftead of exhibiting a

tinued univerfal blaze of light ? And would not this, in the  
  
prefent conftitution of things, obftruct vifion, and totally al-  
ter the fcience of optics ?  
  
The objections, implied in the foregoing queries, feem dedu-  
cible from the hypothefis. There are feveral, which appear  
to arife from the comparifon of light with found.  
  
i° As found (or a vibrating, or undulating, motion in the air,  
which I confider here as fynonimous) is propagated from the fono-  
rous body in all directions ; and furrounds, and is propagated ‘be-  
yond or behind any obftacle in its way : fo light, if it was a vi-  
bration, or undulation, of the elaftic fluid, would furround, and  
be propagated behind an obftacle, like found: but this does  
not agree with the faét.—2° As found, or the vibrating mo-  
tion in the air, originating in a houfe or any other inclofure,  
would, from a hole in one of the fides of it, be propagated ex-  
ternally, in circles, of which the hole would be the centre :  
fo light, if it was a vibration, or occafioned by a vibration, of  
the elaftic fluid, after paffing through a hole, would be propa-  
gated in circles, of which the hole would be the centre. But  
this does not correfpond to the fa&amp;: for light, in pafling  
through any uniform medium, always paffes in right lines.

It feems not improbable, that the’ele¢tric fluid is heteroge-  
néous as well as light.  
  
The heterogeneoufnefs of light is inferred from its colours,  
which are {aid to vary proportionably, as the fize of the parti-  
cles doth vary : the variation becoming confpicuous by a prifm,  
and by other means, which clafs the particles according to their  
re{pective magnitudes, or degrees of refrangibility,and reflexibility.  
  
Befide this, another reafon may be fuggefted, from which the  
heterogeneoufnefs of light may be deduced: namely, becaufe  
it exhibits effects fimilar to fome of thofe of electricity. For  
example, a globe or pane of glafs warmed in the fun or before  
a fire, will fucceflively attract and repel {mall cork balls, down,  
and fuch like bodies infulated, and properly circumftanced ;  
  
and will fhew other figns of electricity communicated to the  
  
glafs by the fun or fire.  
  
So, in regard to electricity, its heterogencoufnefs may be col-  
  
lected from its producing effects refembling fome of thofe of  
light or fire ; which are here confidered as equivalent terms.  
  
Ele@ricity and fire differ in many refpects, and in fome they  
agree ; as hath been fhewn in Dr. Frankiin’s letters on eleétri-  
city. So far as they agree in their effects, their nature may be  
prefumed to be alike : Or rather, from that agreement and fi-  
militude of effects, I think it may be inferred, that they are  
mixt with, and generally do accompany each other ; and that  
each produces its own effect at the time of their joint operation.  
The effects of electricity, fimilar to thofe of fire, being pro-  
duced by the fire mixt with it ; and the effects of fire, refem-  
bling thofe of electricity, being produced by the electricity. mixt  
with that: the compound taking its name from the predo-  
minant principle,  
  
Thus,  
  
  
  
“0  
Pe anil  
ee ae ie RAITT  
  
  
  
  
  
relative to Light and the eleétric Fluid. 193  
  
Thus, fire inflames bodies, and throws its particles or light  
  
-at a diftance. Hence, the explofion of gun-powder, and the  
  
luminous appearance, occafioned by the electric {park : the fire  
mixt with it producing thofe effects.  
  
Thus alfo, electricity attra€ts and repels certain fmall bodies  
alternately, under given circumftances. Hence, the alternate  
attraction and repulfion of glafs, and fome other things, heated  
by fire: the electricity mixt with the communicated fire pro-  
ducing thofe effects.  
  
In this way I would infer the heterogeneoufnefs of light and  
electricity, and their mixture with each other ; and in this way  
account for the fimilitude and difference of their effeéts ; and  
for the luminous appearance or vifibility of the electric {park in  
particular, without diminifhing the pure electric fluid contain-  
edinit: all of which, in the cafe referred to, is faid to go  
diretly, aud is to be found in the place, to which it was def-  
tined.  
  
On the fame principles the fhining of diamonds in the dark  
when rubbed, and thereby eleGrified, may be accounted for,  
without fuppofing they loofe any part of their matter.

be inferred, that they are mixed with,  
and generally do accompany each  
ether: and that each produces its

operation, ‘Theeffectsofelettricity,  
fimilar to thofe of fire, being pro-  
deced by the fire mixed with it; and  
the effects of fire, refembling thofe  
of electricity being produced by the  
eleSricity mixed with that: the  
compound taking its name from the  
predominant principle.  
  
Thus, fire inflames bodies, and  
throws its particles or light at a dif-  
tance. Hence the explefion of gun-  
powder, and the luminous appear-  
ance, occafioned by the electric  
fpark : the fire mixed with it pro-  
ducing thofe effeés.  
  
Thus alfo, electricity attraéts and  
repels certain {mall bodies alternate-

Hence, the alrernate attraStion and  
repulfion of glafs, and fome other  
things, heated by fire: the ele¢trici-  
ty mixed with the communicated fire  
  
producing thofe effects.  
  
In this way, I would infer the he-  
terogeneoufnefs of light and eleétri-  
eity, and their mixture with each  
other; and in this way, account for  
the fimilitude and ditference of their
