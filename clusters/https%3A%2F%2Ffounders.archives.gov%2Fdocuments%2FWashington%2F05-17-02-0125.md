 Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives.  
United States November the 19th 1794  
  
When we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven, by which the American people became a nation; when we survey the general prosperity of our Country, and look forward to the riches, power and happiness, to which it seems destined; with the deepest regret do I announce to you that during your recess, some of the Citizens of the United States, have been found capable of an insurrection. It is due, however, to the character of our Government, and to its stability, which cannot be shaken by the enemies of order, freely to unfold the course of this event.  
During the Session of the year 1790—it was expedient to exercise the legislative power, granted by the Constitution of the United States, “to lay and collect excises.” In a majority of the States scarcely an objection was heard to this mode of taxation. In some indeed, alarms were at first conceived; until they were banished by reason and patriotism. In the four western Counties of Pennsylvania a prejudice, fostered and embittered by the artifice of men who laboured for an ascendancy over the will of others by the guidance of their passions, produced symptoms of riot and violence. It is well known, that Congress did not hesitate to examine the complaints, which were presented; and to relieve them, as far as justice dictated, or general convenience would permit. But the impression, which this moderation made on the discontented, did not correspond, with what it deserved. The arts of delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designing individuals. The very forbearance to press prosecutions was misinterpreted into a fear of urging the execution of the laws; and associations of men began to denounce threats against the officers employed. From a belief, that, by a more formal concert their operation might be defeated; certain self-created societies assumed the tone of condemnation. Hence, while the greater part of Pennsylvania itself were conforming themselves to the acts of excise; a few Counties were resolved to frustrate them. It was now perceived, that every expectation from the tenderness which had been hitherto pursued, was unavailing, and that  
  
further delay could only create an opinion of impotency or irresolution in the Government. Legal process was therefore delivered to the Marshal, against the Rioters and delinquent distillers.  
No sooner was he understood to be engaged in this duty, than the vengeance of armed men was aimed at his person, and the person and property of the Inspector of the Revenue. They fired upon the marshal, arrested him—and detained him, for some time, as a prisoner. He was obliged by the jeopardy of his life, to renounce the service of other process, on the west side of the Alleghany mountain; and a deputation was afterwards sent to him to demand a surrender of that which he had served. A numerous body repeatedly attacked the house of the Inspector, seized his papers of Office—and finally destroyed by fire, his buildings and whatsoever they contained. Both of these Officers, from a just regard to their safety, fled to the Seat of Government; it being avowed, that the motives to such outrages were to compel the resignation of the Inspector—to withstand by force of arms the authority of the United States, and thereby to extort a repeal of the laws of excise, and an alteration in the conduct of Government.  
Upon the testimony of these facts, an associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States notified to me, that “in the Counties of Washington and Alleghany in Pennsylvania laws of the United States were opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed by combinations, too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the Marshal of that District.” On this call, momentous in the extreme, I sought and weighed, what might best subdue the crisis. On the one hand, the Judiciary was pronounced to be stripped of its capacity to enforce the laws: crimes, which reached the very existence of social order, were perpetrated without controul; the friends of Government were insulted, abused and overawed into silence, or an apparent acquiescence; and to yield to the treasonable fury of so small a portion of the United States, would be to violate the fundamental principle of our Constitution, which enjoins that the will of the majority shall prevail. On the other, to array citizen against citizen—to publish the dishonor of such excesses—to encounter the expense, and other embarrassments of so distant an expidition; were steps too delicate—too closely interwoven with many affecting considerations, to be lightly  
  
adopted. I postponed, therefore, the summoning of the militia immediately into the field: But I required them to be held in readiness, that if my anxious endeavours to reclaim the deluded, and to convince the malignant of their danger, should be fruitless; military force might be prepared to Act, before the season should be too far advanced.  
My Proclamation of the 7th of August last was accordingly issued, and accompanied by the appointment of Commissioners, who were charged to repair to the scene of insurrection. They were authorized to confer with any bodies of men, or individuals. They were instructed to be candid and explicit, in stating the sensations, which had been excited in the Executive, and his earnest wish to avoid a resort to coercion; to represent, however, that without submission, coercion must be the resort; but to invite them, at the same time, to return to the demeanor of faithful Citizens, by such accommodations, as lay within the sphere of Executive power—Pardon too, was tendered to them by the Government of the United States, and that of Pennsylvania; upon no other condition, than a satisfactory assurance of obedience to the laws.  
Although the report of the Commissioners marks their firmness and abilities, and must unite all virtuous men, by shewing, that the means of conciliation have been exhausted; all of those who had committed or abetted the tumults, did not subscribe the mild form, which was proposed as the atonement; and the indications of a peaceable temper were neither sufficiently general, nor conclusive, to recommend or warrant, the farther suspension of the march of the militia.  
Thus, the painful alternative could not be discarded. I ordered the militia to march; after once more admonishing the insurgents in my Proclamation of the 25th of September last.  
It was a task too difficult to ascertain with precision the lowest degree of force, competent to the quelling of the insurrection. From a respect, indeed, to œconomy, and the ease of my fellow Citizens, belonging to the militia, it would have gratified me to accomplish such an estimate—My very reluctance to ascribe too much importance to the opposition, had its extent been accurately seen, would have been a decided inducement to the smallest efficient numbers. In this uncertainty, therefore, I put into motion fifteen thousand men, as being an army, which,  
  
according to all human calculation, would be prompt, and adequate in every view; and might perhaps, by rendering resistance desperate, prevent the effusion of blood. Quotas had been assigned to the States of New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia; the Governor of Pennsylvania having declared on this occasion, an opinion which justified a requisition to the other States.  
As Commander in Chief of the militia, when called into the actual service of the United States, I have visited the places of general rendezvous; to obtain more exact information, and to direct a plan for ulterior movements. Had there been room for a persuasion, that the laws were secure from obstruction: that the civil magistrate was able to bring to justice such of the most culpable, as have not embraced the profered terms of amnesty, and may be deemed fit objects of example; that the friends to peace and good Government were not in need of that aid and countenance, which they ought always to receive, and, I trust, ever will receive, against the vicious and turbulent; I should have caught with avidity the opportunity of restoring the militia to their families and home. But succeeding intelligence has tended to manifest the necessity of what has been done; it being now confessed by those, who were not inclined to exaggerate the ill conduct of the insurgents, that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a particular law; but that a spirit, inimical to all order, has actuated many of the offenders. If the state of things had afforded reason for the continuance of my presence with the army, it would not have been withholden. But every appearance assuring such an issue, as will redound to the reputation and strength of the United States, I have judged it most proper, to resume my duties at the seat of Government, leaving the chief command with the Governor of Virginia.  
Still, however, as it is probable, that in a commotion like the present, whatsoever may be the pretence, the purposes of mischief and revenge may not be laid aside; the stationing of a small force for a certain period in the four Western Counties of Pennsylvania will be indispensable, whether we contemplate the situation of those who are connected with the execution of the laws; or of others, who may have exposed themselves by an honorable attachment to them. Thirty days from the commencement of this Session being the legal limitation of the employment of the militia, Congress cannot be too early occupied with this subject.  
  
Among the discussions, which may arise from this aspect of our affairs, and from the documents which will be submitted to Congress, it will not escape their observation, that not only the Inspector of the Revenue, but other officers of the United States in Pennsylvania, have, from their fidelity in the discharge of their functions, sustained material injuries to their property. The obligation and policy of indemnifying them, are strong and obvious. It may also merit attention, whether policy will not enlarge this provision to the retribution of other citizens, who, though not under the ties of Office, may have suffered damage by their generous exertions for upholding the Constitution and the laws. The amount, even if all the injured were included, would not be great; and on future emergencies, the Government would be amply repaid by the influence of an example, that he, who incurs a loss in its defence, shall find a recompence in its liberality.  
While there is cause to lament, that occurrences of this nature should have disgraced the name, or interrupted the tranquility, of any part of our community, or should have diverted to a new application any portion of the public resources, there are not wanting real and substantial consolations for the misfortune. It has demonstrated, that our prosperity rests on solid foundations; by furnishing an additional proof, that my fellow citizens understand the true principles of Government and liberty: that they feel their inseparable union: that notwithstanding all the devices which have been used to sway them from their interest and duty, they are now as ready to maintain the authority of the laws against licentious invasions, as they were to defend their rights against usurpation. It has been a spectacle, displaying to the highest advantage, the value of Republican Government to behold the most and the least wealthy of our citizens standing in the same ranks, as private Soldiers; preeminently distinguished by being the army of the Constitution; undeterred by a march of three hundred miles over rugged mountains, by the approach of an inclement season, or by any other discouragement. Nor ought I to omit to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic cooperation, which I have experienced from the chief magistrates of the States, to which my requisitions have been addressed.  
To every description indeed of citizens let praise be given. But let them persevere in their affectionate vigilance over that  
  
precious depository of American happiness, the Constitution of the United States. Let them cherish it too, for the sake of those, who from every clime are daily seeking a dwelling in our land. And when in the calm moments of reflection, they shall have retraced the origin and progress of the insurrection; let them determine, whether it has not been fomented by combinations of men, who, careless of consequences, and disregarding the unerring truth that those, who rouse, cannot always appease a civil convulsion, have disseminated, from an ignorance or perversion of facts, suspicions, jealousies, and accusations of the whole Government.  
Having thus fulfilled the engagement, which I took, when I entered into office, “to the best of my ability to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” On you Gentlemen and the people by whom you are deputed, I rely for support.  
In the arrangements, to which the possibility of a similar contingency will naturally draw your attention, it ought not to be forgotten, that the militia-laws have exhibited such striking defects, as could not have been supplied but by the zeal of our Citizens. Besides the extraordinary expence and waste, which are not the least of the defects, every appeal to those laws is attended with a doubt on its success.  
The devising and establishing of a well regulated militia, would be a genuine source of legislative honor, and a perfect title to public gratitude. I therefore, entertain a hope, that the present Session will not pass, without carrying to its full energy the power of organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia; and thus providing, in the language of the Constitution, for calling them forth to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.  
As auxiliary to the state of our defence, to which Congress can never too frequently recur, they will not omit to inquire, whether the fortifications, which have been already licenced by law be commensurate with our exigencies.  
The intelligence from the army under the Command of General Wayne, is a happy presage to our military operations against the hostile Indians north of the Ohio. From the advices which have been forwarded, the advance which he has made, must have damped the ardor of the Savages, and weakened their  
  
obstinacy in waging war against the United States. And yet, even at this late hour, when our power to punish them cannot be questioned, we shall not be unwilling to cement a lasting peace, upon terms of candor, equity, and good neighborhood.  
Towards none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendship been spared. The Creeks in particular are covered from incroachment by the interposition of the General Government, and that of Georgia. From a desire also to remove the discontents of the Six Nations, a settlement, meditated at Presqu’isle on Lake Erie, has been suspended; and an agent is now endeavoring to rectify any misconception, into which they may have fallen. But I cannot refrain from again pressing upon your deliberations, the plan which I recommended at the last Session, for the improvement of harmony with all the Indians within our limits; by the fixing and conducting of trading houses, upon the principles then expressed.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
The time which has elapsed, since the commencement of our fiscal measures, has developed our pecuniary resources, so as to open the way for a definitive plan for the redemption of the public debt. It is believed, that the result is such, as to encourage Congress to consummate this work without delay. Nothing can more promote the permanent welfare of the nation, and nothing would be more grateful to our Constituents. Indeed, whatsoever is unfinished of our system of public credit, cannot be benefited by procrastination, and as far as may be practicable, we ought to place that credit on grounds, which cannot be disturbed, and to prevent that progressive accumulation of debt which must ultimately endanger all Governments.  
An estimate of the necessary appropriations, including the expenditures, into which we have been driven by the insurrection, will be submitted to Congress.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives.  
The mint of the United States has entered upon the coinage of the precious metals; and considerable sums of defective coins and bullion have been lodged with the Director by individuals. There is a pleasing prospect that the institution will, at no remote day, realize the expectation, which was originally formed of its utility.  
  
In subsequent communications, certain circumstances of our intercourse with foreign nations, will be transmitted to Congress. However, it may not be unseasonable to announce, that my policy in our foreign transactions has been, to cultivate peace with all the world—to observe treaties with pure and absolute faith—to check every deviation from the line of impartiality—to explain what may have been misapprehended—and correct, what may have been injurious to any nation—and having thus acquired the right, to lose no time in acquiring the ability, to insist upon justice being done to ourselves.  
Let us unite therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations, to spread his holy protection over these United States: to turn the machinations of the wicked to the confirming of our Constitution—to enable us at all times to root out internal sedition, and put invasion to flight—to perpetuate to our Country that prosperity, which his goodness has already conferred, and to verify the anticipations of this Government being a safeguard to human rights.

found capable of an infurrestion. It is  
due, however, tothe character of our gov-  
erament, and to its {tt bility, which cannct  
be thaken by the enemies of order, freely.  
to unfold the courfe of this event.  
  
During the feffion of the year 1799,  
was expedient to exereife the legi! lative  
power granted by the conttitution of tt he  
United States, * to lay and collect excifes.”  
In a majority of the ftates, fe arcely an obs

in fome, indeed, alarms weré at firft con-  
ceived, until they were banithed by reafon

labored for an afcendancy over the will  
of others, by the guidance of their pal-  
fions, produced fymptoms of riot and vi-  
olence. It is well known, that congrefs  
did not hefitate to examine the coinplaints  
which were prefented, and to relieve them,  
as far as jultice dictated, or geacral con-  
venience would permit. But the imprel-  
fion which this moderation made on the  
difcontented, did not correfpond with  
what it deferved; the arts ef delufion  
were no longer continued to the efforts of  
dciigning individuals.  
  
The very forbearance to prefs profecu-  
tions, was mifinterpreted into a fear of  
urging the execution of the laws; and af-  
fociations of men began to denounce  
threats againft the aiven employed.—  
From a belief ghat, by a more formal con-  
cert, their operation might be defeated,  
certaia felf-created focieties affumed the  
tone of condemnation. Hence, while the  
greater part of Pennfylvania itfelf were  
conforming themfelves to the acts of ex-  
ciic, a few counties were re‘olved to fru  
trate them. It was now perceived, that  
every expectation, from the tenderncls  
which had hitherto been pur: ued, was un-  
availing, and thar further delay could on-  
ly create an opinion of impotency, or ir-  
scfoluticn in the government. Legal pro-  
cefs, was, therefore, delivered to the mar-  
fhal, againft the rioters and delingucnt  
diftillers.  
  
No fooner was he underftood to be en-  
gaged in this duty, than the vengeance of  
armed men was aimed at his perfon, and  
the perfonai property of the infpector of  
the revenue. They fired upon the mar-  
fhal, arrefted him, and detained him for  
fome time as a prifoner. He was obliged,  
by the jeopardy of his life, to renounce the  
fervice of other procefs, on the weft fide of  
the Alleghany mquntain ; and a deputa-  
tion wes afterwards fent to him to demand  
a furrender of that which he ad ferved.  
A numerous boy repeatedly attacked the  
houfe of the in’pector, feized his papers  
of office, and finally deftroyed, by fire, his  
buildings, and whatfoever they contained.  
Both of thefe officers, from a juft regard  
to their lafety, fled to the feat of govern-  
ment; it being avowed, that the motives  
of ‘uch outrages were, to compel the refig-  
pation of the infpector; to withftand, by  
t&#x27;¢ force of arms, the authority of the U-  
nited States, and thereby to extort a repeal  
of the laws of excifc,and an alteration in  
the conduct of governmeut.  
  
Upon the tcftimony of thefe facts, an  
  
1794- JOF  
  
affociate juftice of the United States noti-  
fied to me, that, “ in the counties of  
Wathington and Alleghany, in Pennfylva-  
  
nia, laws of the United States were oppof-  
  
ed, and the execution thereof obftructed,  
by combinations, too powerful to be fup-  
prefied by the ordinary courfe of judicial  
proceedings, or by thepowers vefted in the  
  
marfhal of that diftrict.”—On this call,  
momentous in the extreme, | fought and  
weighed what might beft fubduce the crifis.  
On the one hand, the judiciary was pro-  
nounced to be ftripped of its capacity to  
¢alorce the laws: crimes, which reached  
the very exifience of focial order, were  
perpetrated without con’ rol, the friends of  
government were infulted, abufed, and o-  
ver-awed ipto filence, or an apparent ace  
quiefcence ; and to yield to the treafona-  
ble fury of fo {mall a portion of the U-  
nited States, would be to violate the fune  
damental principle of our coniticution,  
which enjoins, that the will of the major-  
ity fall prevail. On the other, to array  
citizen againft citizen—to publith the dif-  
  
honor of fuch excefles—to encounter the  
expenic, and other embarraffments of fo  
  
diftant an expedition, were fteps too del-  
licate—too clofely interwoven with many  
  
affecting confiderations, to be lightly a+  
dopted. I poftponed, therefore, the fum-  
  
moning the militia immediately into the  
  
ficld: but I required them to be held in  
  
readinefs, that if my anxious endeavors  
  
to reclaim the deluded, and to convince  
the malignant of their danger, fhould be  
fruithefs, military force might be prepared  
to act, before the feafon fhould be too far  
advanced.  
  
My proclamation of the 7th of Auguft  
laft, was accordingly iffued, and accompas  
nied by the appointment of commiflion-  
ers, who were charged to repair to the  
fcene of infurreStion. They were au-  
thorifed to confer with any bodies of men  
or individuals. They were inftructed to  
be candid and explicit, in Mating the fen-  
fations which had been excited in the cx-  
ecutive, and his earneft with to avoid a  
refort to coercion ; to reprefent, however,  
that without fubmiffion, coercion m/f be  
the refort; but to invite them, at the fame  
time, to return to the demeanor of faith-  
ful citizens, by fuch accommodations as  
lay within the fphere of the executive  
power—pardon, too, was tendered to  
them by the government of the United  
States, and that of Pennfylvania ; upon  
no other condition, than a fatisfactory  
affuranse of obedience to the laws.  
Although  
  
  
  
  
  
702  
  
Although the report of the commiffion-  
és marks their firmnefs and abilities, and  
muft unite all virtuous men, by thewing  
that the means of conciliation have been  
exhaufled; all of thofe who had commit-  
ted, or abetted the turnults, did not fub-  
feribe the mild form, which was propofed,  
as the atonement; and the indications of  
a peaceable temper werd neither fuffic-  
fently general, nor conclufive to recom-  
mend or warrant a further fafpenfion of  
the march of the militia.  
  
Thus, the painful alternative could not  
be difearded. I ordered the militia to  
march, after once more admonithing the  
infurgents, in my proclamation of the  
asth of September latt.  
  
It was a tatk, too difficult to aftertain  
with precifion, the loweft degree of force  
competent to thé quelling of the iafurre.-  
tion. From a refpext, indeed, to econo-  
my, and the cafe of my feilow-ci&#x27;izens, be-  
longing to the militia,it would have rats  
ified me to aceomplifh fuch an eftimate.  
My very great reluctance to afcribe too  
much importarce to the oppofition, had  
its extent been acenratcly feen, would have  
been a decided inducement to the fmall-  
eft efficient numbers. In this uncertain-  
v7 therefore, 1 put into motion fifteen  
thoufand men, as being an army, which,  
according to all human calculation, would  
be prompt, and adequate in every view,  
and might perhaps by rendering refift-  
ance defperate, prevent the effufion of  
blood. Quotas had been affigned to the  
fates of New-Jerfey, Penifylvania, Mary-  
Jand and Virginia; the governor of Penn-  
fylvania having declared, on this occa-  
  
n, an opinion which juftified a réquiii-  
tion to the other ftates.  
  
As commander in chief of the militia,  
when called into the actual fervice of the  
United States, I have vifited the places of  
  
eral rendezvous, to obtain more exact  
information, and to directa plan for ul-  
terior movements. Had there been room  
for a perfuafion that the laws were fecure  
from obftraction—that the civil magiftrate  
was able to bring to juftice fuch of the  
moft culpable as have not embraced the  
proffered terms of amnefty, and may be  
deemed fit objects of example ; that the  
friends of peace and good government  
were not in need of that aid and coun-  
tenance which they ought always to ree  
ceive, and I truft, ever will receive againtt  
the vicious and turbulent, I fhou&#x27;d have  
caught with avidity the opportunity of  
reftoring the militia to their families and  
  
MASSACHUSETTS MAGAZINE,  
  
home. But fucceeding intelligence has  
tended to manifeft the necefiity of what  
has been done; it being now confefled, by  
thofe who were not inclined to exagzerate  
the ill conduct of the infurgents, that their  
malevolence was not pointed merely toa  
particular law; but that a {pitit, inimical  
to all order, has actuated many of the of-  
fenders. If the ftate of things had a‘Tord.  
éd réafon for the coutiuaance of my pref  
énce with the army, it would not have  
deen withholden : but every appearance  
affuring fuch an iffue as will redownd to  
the reputation and ftrength of the United  
States—I have judged it moft proper to  
refume my duties at the feat of govern.  
ment, leaving the chicf command with  
the cavernor of Virginia.  
  
Still, however, as it is probxble, that &#x27;n  
a commotion like the prefent, whatlocver  
may be the pretence, che purpofes of mif-  
chief an? revenge may not be laid afide;  
the ftationing of a {mall frce, for a ¢-r-  
tain reriod, in the four weéltern counties  
of Pennfylvania, will be indifpeniable,  
whether we cantenplate the fituation  
of thofe wha are connected with the exe-  
cution of the laws or of others, who may  
have exp fd rhemfelves by an honorable

Among the difeuffions, which may arifé  
from this afpect of our affairs, and from  
the documents which will be fubmitted to  
congrefs, it will not efeape their obferva-  
tion, that not only the infpector of the rev-  
enue, but other officers of the United  
States in Pennfylvania, have—from their  
fidelity in the difcharge of their funétions,  
fufained material injuries to their prop-  
erty The obligation and policy of in-  
demnifying them, ate ftrong and obvious.  
It may alfo merit attention, whether policy  
will not calarge this provifion to the retri-  
bution of our citizens, who, though not  
under the ties of office, may have fuffered  
damage by their generous exertions for  
upholding the conftitution and the laws.  
The amount, even if all the injured were  
included, would not bi great ; and on fu  
ture emergencies, the government wou!  
be amplv repaid by the influence of an ex-

on folid foundations ; by furnithing an  
additional preof, that my fellow-citizens  
underftand the true priaciples of govern-  
ment and liberty ; that they feel their in-  
feparable union, that, netwithftanding all  
the devices that have been made ule of  
to fway them froin their intereft and duty,  
they are now as ready to maintain the  
authority of the laws againft hcentious  
invations, as they were to defend their  
rights againft ufurpation. It has been  
a fpeSacle, difplaying to the higheft ads  
vahtage the value of repyblican govern  
ment, to behold the moft and leaft weal-  
thy of our citizens ftanding in the fame  
ranks as private foldicrs ; pre-eminently  
diftinguifhing, by being the army of the  
conftitution; undeterred by a march of  
three hundred miles over rugged moun-  
tains, by the approach of an inclement  
feafon, or by any other difcouragement.  
Nor ought I to omit to acknowledge the  
efficacrous end patriotic co-operation  
which f have experienced from the chief  
magiftrates of the ftates to which my re-  
quifitions have been addreffed.  
  
To every defeription, indeed, of citi-  
zens, let praife be given; but let them  
perfevece im their affectionate vigilance  
over that precious depofitory of Anierican  
happinefs, the coaftitution of the United  
States. Let them cherith it too, fox the  
fake of thofe, who, from every clime, are  
eaily feeking a dwelling in our land. And  
when, in the calm moments of reflection,  
they fhall have retraced the origin and  
progrefs of the infurrestion, let them de-  
termine, whether it has not been fomented  
by combinagions of men, who, carelefs  
  
confequences, and difregarding the un-  
erring truth, that thofe, who roufe, can-  
not always appeale a civil convullon,  
have difeminated, from au ignorance or  
perverfion of facts, (ufpicions, jealuufies,  
and accufations of the whole government.  
  
Having thus fulfilicd the engagement  
Which Itoak, when | entered into office,  
“to the belt of my ability to preferve, pro-  
tect and defend the conftitution of the U-  
nited States,” on you, gentlemen, and the  
people by whom you are deputed, { rely  
for fupport.  
  
In the arrangements to which the pof-  
fibility of a fimilar contingency will natu-  
rally draw your attention, it eught not te  
be iorgotten, that the militia laws have  
exhibited fuch ftriking defects, as could  
not have been fupplied but by the zeal of  
our citizens. Befides the extiaordinary  
expeafe, and wafte, which are not the  
lealt of the defects ; every appeal to thofe  
laws is attended with a doubt on its fuce  
cefs.  
  
The devifing and eftablithing of 4-well  
regulated militia, would be a genuine  
fuurce of legiflative honor, and a perfe&amp;  
title to public gratitude. 1! therefore, en-  
tertain a hope, that the prefent feflion  
will not pafs, without carrying to its full  
energy, the power of organizing, arming  
and difciplining the militia ; and thus proe  
viding, in the language of the conftitution,  
for calling them forth to execute the laws  
of the union, fupprefs infurrection, and  
repel invafion.  
  
As auxiliary to the ftate of our defence,  
to which congrefs cannot too frequently  
recur, they will not omfit to inquire wheth-  
er the fortifications which have been al-  
ready licenfed by law, be commenfurate  
wish our exigencies,  
  
The incelligence from the army under  
the command of Gencral Waynes, is a  
happy prefage to our military Opcrations  
agaiaft the hoftile Indians north of the 0-  
bio, From the advices which have been  
forwarded, the advaace he has made mult  
have damped the ardor of the favages,  
and weakeaed their obftinacy in waging  
war againft the United States, and yet,  
even at this late hour, when our power  
to punifh them canuot be queftioned,  
we {hall not be unwilling to cement a laft-  
ing peace, upon terms of candor, equity, |  
and good neighborhood.  
  
Towards none of the Indian tribes have  
overtures of friendthip been fpared. The  
Creeks in particular are covered from en-  
croachment by the iaterpofitioa of the  
geucral government, and that of Georgia.  
From a defire alfo to remove the difcon-  
tents of the fix nations, a settlement, medi-  
tated at Prof’ The, on Lake Brie, has beea  
fufpended ; and aa ageut is now endeav-

which they may have fallen. Butl can-  
not refrain from again preiling upon your

Gentlemen of the houfe of repr-f#tatives,  
  
The time which has elapfed fince the  
commencement of our fifeal meafures, has  
developed our pecuniary refources, fo as  
to open a way for a definitive plan for  
the red¢mption of our public debt. It is  
believed, that the rcfult is fuch as to en-  
courage congrefs to confummate this work  
without delay. Nothing can more pro-  
mote the permanent welfare of the na-  
tion, and nothing would be more grateful  
toOour conftituents. Indeed, whatfoever is  
unfinifhed of our fyftem of public credit,  
cannot be benefitted by procraftination,  
and as far as may be practicable, we  
ought to place that eredit on grounds  
which cannot be difturbed, and to pre-  
vent that. progreflive accumulation of  
debt, which muf ultimately cudanger all  
governments.  
  
An eftimate of the neceflary appropria-  
tions, including the expenditures into  
which we have been driven by the infur-  
rection, will be fubmitted to congrefs.  
Gentlemen of the fenate, and of the  
  
boufe of repref-ntatives,  
  
The mint of the United States has en-  
tered upon the coinage of the precious  
metals, and confiderable fums of defective  
edins arid bullion have been lodged with  
the director by individuals. There is a  
pleafing profpedt, that the inflitution will,  
at no remote day, realize the expectation  
which was originally formed of its util-  
ity.  
In fubfequent communications, certain  
circumfances of our intercourfe with  
foreign nations, will be tranfmitted to  
congrefs ; however, it may not be unfea-  
fonnable to announce, that my policy, in  
our foreign trarifactions, has been, to cul-  
tivate peace with all the world—To ob-  
ferve treaties with pure and abfolute faith  
-—to check every deviation from the line  
Gf impartiality—to explain what may have  
been mifapprehended—and correct what  
may have been injurious to any nation’;  
and having thus acquired the right, to  
fe notime in acquiring the ability, to  
infift upon juftice being done ourfelves.  
  
Let us unite, therefore, in imploring the  
Supreme Ruler of nations, to {pread his  
holy proteétion over thefe United States,  
return the machinations of the wicked to  
the confirming of our con{titutica—to en-  
able us at all times to root out internal fe-  
dition, and put invafion to fight—to per-  
petuate to our country that profperity  
which his goodnefs has already conferred,  
and to verify the anticipations of this  
  
government being a fafeguard to humar  
  
rights.

in the Chamber of the House of Rerresenratives, and delivered  
the following ADDRESS:  
  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
HEN we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven, by  
which the American people became a nation; when we fur-  
vey the general profperity of our country, and look forward to the  
riches, power, and. happinefs, to which it feems deftined, with the  
deepeft regret do I announce to you, that during your recefs, fome  
of the citizens of the United States have been found capable of an  
infurrection. It is due, however, to the character of our govern-  
ment, and to its ftability, which cannot be fhaken by the enemies to  
  
order, freely to unfold the courfe of this event.  
  
During the feflion of the year 1 790, it was expedient to exercife the  
legiflative power granted by the Conftitution of the United States,  
  
«to lay and collect excifes.” Ina majority of the States fcarcely an  
  
objection was heard to this mode of taxation. In fome, indeed,  
  
alarms were at firft conceived, until they were banifhed by reafon and  
patriotifm. Inthe four weftern counties of Peunfylvania, a preju-  
dice, foftered and embittered by the artifice of men who laboured for  
am afcendency over the will of others, by the guidance of cheigper

fons, produced fymptoms of riot and violence. It is well known,  
that Congrefs did not hefitate to examine the complaints which were  
prefented, and to relieve them as far as juftice dictated, or general con-  
venience would permit. But the impreflion which this moderation  
made on the difcontented did not correfpond with what it deferved:  
the arts of delufion were no longer confined to the efforts of defigning  
individuals. .  
The very forbearance to prefs profecutions was mifinterpreted into  
  
4 fear of urging the execution of the laws; and affociations of men be-  
an to denounce threats againft the officers employed. From a be-  
  
lief, that, by a more formal concert their operation might be defeated,  
certain felf-created focieties affumed the tone of condemnation;  
hence, while the greater part of Pennfylvania itfelf were conforming  
themfelves to the a¢ts of excife, a few counties were refolved to frui-  
tratethem. It was now perceived that every expectation from the  
  
_ tendernefs which had been hitherto purfued, was unavailing, and that  
  
further delay could only create an opinion of impotency, or irrefo-  
lution in the government; legal procefs was therefore delivered to  
the marfhal againft the rioters and delinquent diftiliers.  
  
No fooner was he underftood to be engaged in this duty, than the  
vengeance of armed men was aimed at Ais perfon, and the perfon and  
property of the infpector of the revenue. They fired upon the mar-  
thal, arrefted him, and detained him, for fome time, as a prifoner.  
He was obliged, by the jeopardy of his life, to renounce the fervice of  
other procefs, on the weft fide of the Alleghany mountain ; and a de-  
putation was afterwards fent to him to demand a ‘furrender of that  
which he ad ferved. A numerous body repeatedly attacked the  
houfe of the infpector, feized his papers of office, and finally deftroy-  
ed, by fire, his buildings, and whatfoever they contained.” Both of  
thefe officers, from a juft regard to their fafety, fled to the feat of go-  
vernment; it being avowed that the motives to fuch outrages were to  
compel the refignation of the infpector, to withftand by force of  
arms, the authority of the United States, and thereby to extort a repeal  
of the laws of excife, and an alteration in the conduct of government.  
  
Upon the teftimony of thefe facts, an affociate juftice of the Su-  
preme Court of the United States notified to me, that, “in the  
counties of Wafhington and Alleghany, in Pennfylvania, laws of the  
United States were cppofed, and the execution thereof obfiructed by  
combinations too powerful to be fupprefled by the ordinary courle of  
judicial proceedings, or by the powers vefted in the marfhal of that  
diftrié&amp;t.” On this call, momentous in the extreme, I fouglit and  
weighed what might beft fubdue the crifis, On the one hand, the ju-  
diciary was pronounced to be itript of its capacity to enforce the laws :  
crimes, which reached the very exiftence of focial order, were perpe-  
trated without controul; the friends of government were infulted, abut-  
ed and overawed into filence, or a apparent acquiefcence; and to  
fury of fo finall a portion of the United States,  
fundamental principle of our Conititution,  
fhall prevail. On the  
th the difhonour of  
  
yield to the treafonable  
would be to violate the rin  
which enjoins that the will of the majority

of fo diftant an expedition, were fteps too delicate—too clofely in-  
  
terwoven with many affecting confiderations, to be lightly adopted: I  
  
poftponed, therefore, the fummoning of the militia immediately into  
  
the fieid; but I required them to be held in readinefs, thatif my anxi-  
  
ous endeavours to reclaim the deluded, and to convince the malig-  
  
nant of their danger, fhould be fruitlefs, military force might be pre-  
  
pared to act before the feafon fhiould be too far advanced.  
  
My proclamation of the 7th of Augufl laft, was accordingly iffted,  
and accompanied by the appointment of commiffioners, who were  
charged to repair to the fcene of infurrection. They were authorized  
to confer with any bodies of men or individuals. They were inftrué-  
ed to be candid and explicit in ftating the fenfations which had been  
excited in the executive, and his earneft with to avoid a refort to coer-  
cion; to reprefent, however, that without fubmiffion, coercion muff  
be the reiort; but to invite them, at the fame time, to return to the  
demeanor of faithful citizens, by fuch accommodations as lay within  
the fphere of executive power—pardon too, was tendered to them by  
the government of the United States, and that of Pennfylvania, upon  
no other condition than a fatisfactory aflurance of obedience to the  
laws.  
  
Although the report of the commiffioners marks their firmnefs and  
abilities, and muft unite all virtuous men, by fhewing, that the means  
of conciliation have been exhaufted; all of thofe who had committed  
er abetted the tumults, did not fubfcribe the mild form, which was  
propofed as the atonement; and the indications of a peaceable temper  
were neither fufficiently general, nor conclufive, to recommend or  
warrant the farther fufpenfion of the march of the militia.  
  
Thus, the painfal alternative could not be difcarded. I ordered the  
militia to march, after once more admonifhing the infurgents, in my  
proclamation of the 25th of September laft.  
  
it was a tafk too difficult to afcertain with precifion the loweft de-  
gree of force, competent to the quelling of the infurrection. From  
a re{pect, indeed, to economy, and the eafe of my fellow citizens, be-  
longing to the militia, ‘it would have gratified me to accomplifh fuch  
aneftimate. My very great reluétance to afcribe too much import-  
ance to the oppofition, had its extent been accurately feen, would  
have beena decided inducement to the fmalleft efficient numbers. In  
this uncertainty, therefore, I put into motion fifteen thoufand men,  
as beingan army, which, according to all human calculation, would  
be prompt, and adequate in every view; and might, perhaps, by ren-  
cering refiftance defperate, prevent the effafion of blood. Quotas  
had been afliened to the flates of New-Jerfey, Pennfylvania, Maryland  
and Virginia; the Governor of Pennfylvania having declared on this  
eccafion, an opinion which juftified a requifition to the other ftates.  
  
As Commander in Chief of the Militia, when called into the a&amp;ual  
fervice of the United States, I have vifited the places of general ren-  
dezvous, to obtain more exaét information, and to direét a plan for  
ulterior movements. Had there been room for a perfuafion that the  
Jaws were fecure from obftruétion—that the civil magiftrate was able  
  
to bring to juftice fuch of the moft culpable as have not embraced the  
proffered offers of amnefty, and may be deemed fit objefts of exem-

le; that the friends of peace and good government were not in need  
of that aid and countenance which they ought always to receive, and  
  
Itruft, ever will receive, againft the vicious and turbulent; I fhould  
have caught with avidity the opportunity of reftoring the militia to  
their families and home; but fucceeding intelligence has tended to  
manifeft the neceflity of what has been done; it being now confeffed  
by thofe who were not inclined to exaggerate the ill-conduét of the  
infurgents, that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a parti-  
cular law; but that a fpirit, inimical to all order, has actuated many of  
the offenders. If the ftate of things had afforded reafon for the con-  
tinuance-of my prefence with the army, it would not have been with-  
holden; but every appearance afluring fucl an iffue as will redound  
to the reputation and ftrength of the United States, I have judged it  
moft proper to refuume my duties at the feat of government, leaving  
the chief command with the Governor of Virginia.  
  
Still, however, asit is probable, that in a commotion like the pre-  
fent, whatfoever may be the pretence, the purpofes of mifchief and  
revenge may not be laid afide: the ftationing of a {mall force, for a  
certain period, in the four weftern counties of Penufylvania, will be  
indifpenfible, whether we contemplate the fituation of thofe who are  
connected with the execution of the laws, or of others who may have  
expofed themfelves by an honourable attachment to them.  
  
Thirty days from the commencement of this feflion, being the le-  
gal limitation of the employment of the militia, Congrefs cannot bé  
too early occupied with this fubject.  
  
Among the difcuffions which may arife from this afpect of our af-  
fairs, and from the documents which will be fubmitted to Congrefs,  
it will not efcape their obfervation, that not only the infpector of the  
revenue, but other officers of the United States in Pennfylvania, have,  
from their fidelity in the difcharge of their fun@ions, fuftained mate-  
rial injuries to their property. The obligation and policy of indem-  
nifying them, are ftrong and obvious. It may alfo merit attention,  
whether policy will not enlarge this provifion to the retribution of  
other citizens, who, though not under the ties of office, may have fuffered  
damage by their generous exertions for upholding the conftitution and  
the laws. The amount, even if all the injured were included, would  
not be great ; and, on future emergencies, the government would be  
amply repaid by the influence of an example, that he who incurs a  
lofs in its defence fhall find a recompence in its liberality.  
  
While there is caufe to lament, that occurrences of this nature  
fhould have difgraced the name, or interrupted the tranquillity of any  
part of our community, or fhould have diverted to a new applica-  
tion any portion of the public refources, there are not wanting  
real and fubftantial confolations for the misfortune. It has demon-  
ftrated that our profperity refts on folid foundations, by furnifhing an  
additional proof, that my fellow citizens underitand the true princi-  
ples of government and liberty; that they fee their infey arable uni-  
on; that notwithftanding all the devices which have been ufed to

indulgence of Heaven, by which the A­  
merican people became a nation; when  
we survey the general prosperity of our  
country, and look forward to the riches,  
power and happiness, to which it seems  
dedined; with the deepest tegret do I  
announce to you that during your recess,  
some of the citizens of the United  
States, have been found capable of an  
infurre&amp;ion. It is due, however, to  
the character of our government, and  
to its (lability, which cannot be lhaken  
by the enemies of order, freely to un­  
fold the coilrfe of this event.  
During the feflion of the year 1790—  
it was expedient to ex?rcile the legisla­  
tive power, granted by the Constitution  
of the United States, &quot; to lay and col­  
ledt In a majority of the  
States fcarcelv an objection was heard  
to this mode of taxation. In some in­  
deed, alarms wet* at firft conceived ;  
until they wefe banished by rcafon and  
patriotism. In the four western coun­  
ties of Pennsylvania a prejudice, foftered  
and embittered by the artifice of men  
who labored for an ascendancy over the  
will of otheis by the guidance of   
paflions, produced symptoms of rrot  
and violence. It is well known, that  
Congnefi did not hesitate to examine  
the complaints which were presented ;  
*nd to relieve them, as far as jultice  
di&amp;ated, or general convenience would  
permit.  
.But the impreflion, which this mo­  
deration made on the difcontcntcd, did  
not correfpoud, with what it deserved.  
The arts of delusion were no longer  
confined to the efforts of defrgning in­  
dividuals. The very forbearance to  
press prosecutions was misinterpreted in­  
to a rear of urging the execution of the  
Jaws ; and atTociations of men began to  
denounce threats againllthe officers em­  
ployed. From a belief, that, by a  
more formal concert their operation  
might be defeated ; certain felf-created  
focicties a {Turned the cone of condem­  
pation. Hence, while the greater part  
of Pennsylvania itfelf were conforming  
themselves to the a&lt;Ss of excise ; a few  
•ownties were tefolvcd to fruftrat? them.  
  
It mi now perceived, that every expec­  
tation fiom the tenderneli whi h had been  
hitherto purs.ted, was unavailing, and  
that tart her delay could only reate an o­  
pin on of impotency&#x27;or involution in the.  
government. Legal proeefs Was there­  
fare delivered to the Marihal, against the  
rioters and delinquent diftillcrs.  
  
Mo sooner was he underload to be  
engaged in this duty, than the ven­  
geance of armed men was aimed at his  
! person, and the £erfon and property of  
the infpeftor of the revenue. They fi­  
red upon the marfhal,arretted him—and  
detained him, for some time, as a pri­  
soner. He was obliged by the jeopar­  
dy of his life, to renounce the feivice of  
ether process, on the welt fide of the  
Allegheny mountain ; and a deputation  
was afterwards sent to hi-n to demand a  
furretider of that which he hadferved.  
A numerous body repeatedly attacked  
thehoufe of the infpeftor, seized hispa­  
persof office, and finally dettroyed by fire,  
hisbuildingand whatfoeverthey contain­  
ed. Both of these officers, from a just re­  
gard to their fafety, fled to the feat of go­  
vernment ; it being avowed, that the mo­  
tives to such outrages were to compel the.  
resignation of the Jnfpeilor—to withiland  
by force of arms the authority of the United  
States, and thereby to extort a repeal of  
the laws of excise, and an alteration in  
the conduit of Government.  
  
Upon the testimony of thefc falls, an af­  
focia&#x27;e justice of the fuprem? court of the  
United States, notified to me, that &quot; in the  
&quot; counties ofWafhington and Allegheny  
&quot; in Pennsylvania, laws of the United  
&quot; States, were opposed, and the execution  
&quot; thereof obftru&lt;4ed by combinations, too  
&quot; powerful to be fupprefled by the ordi­  
&quot; nary course of judicial proceedings, or  
&quot; by the powers vetted in the Marfh.il of  
&quot; that diitrift.&quot; On this call, momentous  
in the extreme, 1 fought and weighed,  
w hat might best subdue the erifis.   
On the one hand, the Judiciary was  
pronounced to be dripped of its capa­  
city to enforce the laws:—Crimes,  
which reached the very exiftcnce of so­  
cial order, were perpetrated without  
controul;—The friends of Government  
were insulted, abused and overawed into  
silence, or an apparent acquiescence ;  
and to yield to the treasonable fury of  
so small a portion of the United States,  
would be to violate the fundamental  
principle of our Constitution, which en­  
joins that the will of the majority (hall  
prevail.—On the other, to array citizen  
against citizen—to publifn the dilhonor  
of fueh exceffe3—to encounter the ex-  
  
pence, and other embarraflmenta of so  
.dittant an expedition ; were tteps too de­  
licate; too closely interwoven with many  
affe&lt;3ing confederations to be lightly adopted  
—1 poftponed,therefore,the summoning  
of the militia immediately into the  
field : hut 1 required them to be held in  
readiness, that if my anxious endeavors  
to reclaim the deluded, and to convince  
the malignant of their danger, should  
be fruitless; military force might be pre­  
pared to &amp;&amp;., before the ftaians should  
be too far advanced.  
  
My proclamation of the 7th of Au­  
gust last was accordingly iffueds and ac­  
companied by the appointment of com­  
milTioncrs, who were chargcd to repair  
to the scene of infurrediion. They  
were authorized to coufer witlvany bo­  
dies of men or individuals. They were  
inftru&amp;ed to be candid and explicit, in  
dating the sensations, which had been  
excited in the Executive, and his ear­  
ned wilh to avoid a resort to co-ercion ;  
to represent, however, that without sub­  
mission, co-crcion mu/i be the resort;  
but to invite them, at the fame time, to  
return to the demeanor of faithful citi­  
zen!, by such accommodations as lay  
within the sphere of executive power—  
pardon too, was tendered to them by  
the government of the United States,  
and that of Pennsylvania, upon no other  
condition, than a fatisfactory assurance  
of obedienc« to the laws.  
Although the report of the Commifiio­  
ners marks their firmnels and abilities,  
and must unite all virtuous men, by (hew­  
ing, that the means of conciliation have  
cxhaufted ; all of those who commit-  
Sea or abited the tumults, did not fubferibe  
the mildform, which wa«propofed at the  
atonement; and the indications of a pea­  
ceable temper were neither fufficiently ge­  
neral, nor conclulive, to recommend or  
warrant, the farther suspension of the  
march of the militia.  
  
Thus the painful alternative could not  
be discarded.  
  
I ordered the militia to march, after  
once more admoni(hing the Insurgents  
in my Proclamation of the 2jth Sep­  
tember last.  
  
It was a ta(k too difficult to ascer­  
tain with precision the lowed degree of  
force, competent to the quelling of the  
Infurreftion. From a rtfpeft, indeed,  
to ceconomy, and the ease of my fellow  
citizens, belonging to the militia, it  
would have gratified me to accompliffi  
such an estimate.  
  
My very great rclu&amp;ance to afcri&#x27;je too  
mucfi importance to the opposition,  
had its extent been accurately seen,  
would have been a decided inducement  
to the smallest efficient numbers. In  
  
this uncertainly, therefore, I put irrto f  
  
motion fifteen thousand m&lt;n, as beiHg  
an army, which, according to all hu­  
man calculation, would be prompt, aad  
adequate in every view; a. J plight per­  
haps, rendering refiilance d.ipt, ate, p. e­  
vent the eflution of blood. Quotas  
had been afligned to the States  
of New-Jersey, Pcnnfylvania, Miryiand,  
and Virginia; the governor of Peimfylva­  
nia having declared on this occasion, an  
opinion which juftified a requiGtion to the  
other states.  
  
Ai commander in chief of the mili  
tia, when called into the actual service  
of the United States, I hare visited the  
places of general rendezvous ; to obtain  
more exait information, and to direct a  
plan for ulterior movemeuts. Had there  
been room for a persuasion, that the  
laws were secure from obstruction : that  
the civil magistrate was able to bring to  
jultice such of the molt culpable, as  
have not embraced the proffered terms  
of amnelty, and may be deemed fit ob­  
jects of example ; that the friends to  
peace and good government were not  
in need of that aid and countenance, i  
which they ought always to receive,  
I trull, ever will receive, again ft  
the vicious and turbulent; I (hould have  
caught with avidity the opportunity of  
restoring the militia to their families and  
home. But Succeeding intelligence has&quot;  
tended to manifeft the neceflity of what  
has been done; it being now confeffed by  
those, who were not inclined to exag­  
gerate the illcondudt of the Insurgents,  
that their malevolence was not pointed  
merely to a paiticular law; but that  
a spirit inimical to all order, h?.s adtu  
ated ?na.iy of the offenders. If the i  
date of things had afforded reason for  
the continuance of my presence with  
the army, it would not have been with­  
holden. But every appearance aflki ing  
fu«h an issue, as will redound to the  
reputation and ftrenght of the United  
States, I have judged it rajft proper,  
to resume my duties at the ieat of go­  
vernment ; leaving the chits command  
with the Governor of Virginia. .  
Still, however, is it is probable, that  
in a coramo;ion like the present, what­  
ioever may be the pretence, the purjfofes  
of mifchief and revenge may not be laid  
aside ; the (latiomng of a/mall force for  
a certain period, in the four weitern  
counties of Pctinfylvania will be indis­  
pensable, whether we contemplate the  
filiation of those who are connected  
with the execution of the laws ; or of  
others, who may have exposed them­  
selves by an honorable attachment to  
them. Thirty days from the commence­  
ment of this session, being the legal li­  
mitation of i the employment of the Mi­  
litia, Congress cannot be too early  
occupied with this Subject.  
Among the difcuilions, which may  
arise from this afpedt of our affairs, and  
from the documents which will be sub­  
mitted to Congress, it will not escape  
their observation, that not only the 111-  
fpeCtor of the Revenue, but other of­  
ficers of the United States in Pennsyl­  
vania, have, from tbeir fidelity in the  
discharge of their functions, sustained  
material injuries to their property. The  
obligation and policy of indemnifying  
them, are strong and obvious.  
It may also merit attention, whether  
policy will not enlarge this provision to  
the retribution of other citizens, who,  
tho&#x27; not under the ties of office, may.  
have fuffeTed damage by their generous  
exertions for upholding the conltitution  
and the laws. The amount, even if all  
the injured were included, would not  
be great ; and on future emergencies,  
the Government would be amply repaid j  
by the influence of an example, that j  
he, who incurs a loss in its defence, (  
(hall find a tecompetce in its liberality, j  
While there is canfe to lament, that oc­  
currences of this nature fliotild have dis­  
graced the name, or interrupted the tran­  
quility, of any part of our community, or j  
ihould have diverted to a nfw application  
any portion of the public resources, there |  
are not wanting real and fuhltantial conso­  
lations for the misfortune. It has demon­  
strated, that our prosperity rests on solid  
foundations ; by furnilhing an additional  
proof, that my fellow-citizens underltand  
the trueprinciples of gevernment&amp; liberty.  
That they feel their inseparable union.— j  
That notwithstanding all the devices which i  
have been used to sway them from their  
interest and duty, they are now as ready !  
to maintain the authority of the laws a­  
gainlt licentious invasions, as they were to  
defend their rights against usurpation.  
It has betn a fpedtacle, displaying to  
the highest advantage, the value of repub­  
lican government to behold the molt and  
the least wealthy of our citizens Handing  
in the feme ranks, as private soldiers ;—  
pre-emiently diftinguiihed by being the  
army of the confutation ; undeterred by a  
march of three huudred miles over rugged  
mountains, by the approach of an incle­  
ment season, or by any ether discourage­  
ment. Nor ought Ito omit to acknow­  
ledge the efficacious and patriotic co-o  
,luu ation, which I have expe. lenccd from  
on&gt; chief magistrate» of the States, to w  
:en&gt; j mv requifitiona have been addrelfed.  
tent to every description indeed of citi-  
In j zens Jet praise be given. But let them  
into I persevere in their affectionate vigilance  
  
over that precioui depofitony of Ame­  
rican happiness, the Confcitutien of the  
United States.  
Let them clierilli it to &gt;, far the fake  
of those, who frurr, ever) clime ar. dai­  
ly seeking. a dwelling in our laud. And  
u ben in the calm mordents of refle&amp;ion,  
they fliill have retraced the origin and  
prog reft of the iolsrre&amp;tou ; let them  
determine, whether it has not been fo­  
mented by combination* of men, who,  
cavelefgof confluences, and disregard­  
ing the unerring truth that those, who  
rotife, cannot always appease a civil con­  
vulCon, have diflcminated, from an ig­  
norance or perveifion of facta, suspici­  
ons, jealousies, and accufatioas of the  
whole government.  
Having thus fulfilled the engagement,  
which I took, when I entered into of­  
fice, &quot; to the best of my ability to pre­  
serve, pioteft and defend the Constitu­  
tion of the United States,&quot; on you  
Gentlemen, and the people by whom  
you are deputed, I rely for support.  
In the to which the  
possibility of a similar contingency wiU  
naturally draw your attention, it o:»ght  
not to be forgotten, that the militia  
laws have exhibited such striking dc­  
fedls, as could not have been supplied  
but by the zeal of our Citizens. lie­  
fides the extraordinary cxpence and  
walte, which are not the lead of the de­  
fers, every appeal to those laws is at­  
tended with a doubt on it» full fucccefs.  
  
The deviling and eftablilhing of a well  
regulated militia, would be a genuine  
source of legislative honor and a perfect  
title to public gratitude—l therefore enter­  
tain a hope, that the present session will  
not pass, without carrying to its full ener­  
gy the power of organizing, arming, and  
Uifciplining the militia ; and thus piovid­  
ing, in the language of the conftitutioji  
for calling them iorth to execute the laws  
of the union, fuppreii infurre&amp;ions, and  
repel invasions.  
As auxiliary to the date of our de­  
fence, to which Congress can never too  
frequently recur, they will not omit to  
enquire, whether thefortifieations,which  
have been already licensed by law be  
commensurate with our exigencies.  
The intelligence from the army un­  
der the command of Gen. Wayne, is a  
happy presage to our military operati­  
ons againtl the hodile Indians north of  
the Ohio. From the udvices which  
have been forwarded, the advance  
which he has made, mwft liave damped  
the ardor of the lavages, and weakened  
their nbftinacy in waging war againd  
the United States.  
  
And yet, even at this late hour, when  
our power to punilh them cannot be  
queilioned, we (hall not be unwilling to  
cement a lading peace, upon terms of  
candour, equity, and good neighbour­  
hood.  
  
Towards none of the Indian tribes  
liave overtures of friendfhip been spared..  
The Creeks in particular are covered  
from encroachment by the interposition  
of the General Government, and that  
of Georgia. From a riefire also to re­  
move the discontents of the Six Nati­  
ons, a fcttlcment, meditated at Prefq­  
iflc, on lake Erie, has been suspended, and  
an Agent isnowendeavoringtore&amp;ify any  
mifconcepticn into which they may have  
fallen. But I cannot refraia from again  
prefling upon your deliberations the plan  
which 1 rcconunended at the last session,  
for the improvement of harmony with all  
the Indians within our limits ; by the fix­  
ing and conducting of trading houfes,upon  
the principles then expressed.  
Gentlemen of the House of Reprefentat vej  
The time which has elapsed, since  
the commencement of our fifcal mca­  
fures, has developed our pecuniary re­  
sources; so as to open the way for a  
definitive plan for the ledemption of  
thi Public Debt. It is believed, that  
the result is such, as to encourage Con­  
gress to consummate this work without  
delay. Nothing could tr.orc promote  
the permanent welfare of the Ration,  
and nothing would be more grateful to  
our condiments.  
  
Indeed, whatsoever is unfinilhed of our  
fyllem of Public Credit, cannot be bene­  
fited by Procrastination, and as far as  
may be practicable, we ought to place  
that credit, on grounds, which cinnot be  
distrusted, and to prevent that progreflive  
accumulation of debt which must ultimate­  
ly endanger all governments.  
An estimate of the necefiary appropriati­  
ons, including the expenditures, into  
which we have been driven by the insur­  
rection, will be fubraittcd to Congress.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the  
House of Representatives.  
The Mint of the United States ha&#x27; t\
tered upon tjie coinage of the precious  
tals ; and considerable sums of defeCti  
coins and bullion have been lodged witi  
the Direflor by individuals. There is a  
pleasing prospeCt that the institution will,  
at no remote day, realize the expectation,  
which was originally formed of its utility.  
In fubfequcnt communications, cer­  
tain circumstances of our intercourse  
with foreign nations, will be transmitted  
to Congress. However, it may not be  
unfeafooable to announce, that my policy  
  
the  
  
in our foreign tranfa£tions lias beer, to  
Cultivate peace with all the no rid—to ob­  
n.r&#x27;. eTreaties with pure &amp; absolute faith ;  
to 1 heck every deviation from the line  
in impartiality—to explain what may  
have been mil-apprehended—and cor­  
rect, what may have been injurious to  
any nation—and having thus acquired  
the right, to lose no time m acquiring  
the ability, to insist upon justice being  
done to ourselves.  
  
Let n» unite therefore, in imploring  
the Supreme Ruler of Nations to  
rfpread his hohr protection oyer these  
United States :—to turn the machina­  
tions of the wicked to the confirming  
of our Conltitution—to&#x27; enable us at  
all times to root out internal fc­  
ditlon, and put inrafion to flight—  
to perpetuate to our country that prosperi­  
ty which his goodness has already confer­  
ed, and to verify the.miicipations of this  
government being a fate guard to human  
rights.

gislature 1n the Hall of the House of Reprefen­  
tauves, and dehivered the following  
ADDRESS:  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, &#x27;  
and cf the House of Representatives,  
\/ﬂfHEN we call to mind the gracious  
indulgence of Heaven, by which  
the American people became a nation ; when  
we survey the general prolperity of our country,  
and look forward to the riches, power, and hap,  
pinels, to which 1t seems deflined ; with the  
deepest regret do I ammounce to you; that dur­  
ing your recess, some of the citizens of the Uni­  
ted States have been found capable of an infur­  
retion.. It is due, however, to the charafter of  
our government, and to Its stability, which can­  
not be shaken by the enemies of order, freely to  
unfeld the courle of this event.  
During the session of the year 1790, it was  
expedient to exercise the legislative power grant­  
ed by the constitution of the United States, to  
*‘lay and colle&amp;t excises.” In a majority of the  
States, {carcely an objellion was heard to this  
mode of taxation. In some, indeced, alarms  
were at firll conceived, until theéy were banithed  
by reason and patrioi{m. In the four weflern  
connties of Pennsylvania, a prejudice, foflered  
and embittered by the aitifice of men who la­  
bored for an afcendency over the will of others;  
by the guidange of their paflions, produced symp­  
toms of riot and violence. It 1s well known,  
that Congress did not helitate to examine  
the comp%aints which were presented, - and  
to relieve them, as far as jullice diftated, or  
general convemence would permit. Bat the  
impreflion which this moderation made on the  
dilcontented did not correspond with what it de­  
served ; the arts of delusion were no-longer con­  
tinued to the efforts of designing individuals.  
The very forbearance to press prosecutions,  
was misinterpreted. into a fear of urging the ex­  
ecution of the laws ; and associations of men be­  
gan to denounce threats against the officers em­  
ployed—From a belief that, by a more formal  
concert, their operation might be defeated,  
certain {elfcreated societies afflumed the tone of  
condemnation. Hence while the greater part  
of Pennsylvania itfelf were conforming them­  
{elves to the alls of excile, a few counties were  
resolved to fruftrate them. It was now perceiv­  
ed, that every expeftation from the tendernefls  
which had hitherto been pur{ued, was unavailing,  
and that further delay could only create an opin­  
ion of impotency, or irreflolution in the govern­  
ment. Legal process, was therefore, delivered  
to the Ma:ﬁ)al, aganit the rioters and delin­  
quent difhllers. L e R Md e  
No sooner was he understood to be engaged  
1a this duty, than the vengeance of armed men  
was aimed at his person, and the personal pro­  
zcrty of the Infpetlor of the Revenue. They  
red upon the Marshal, arrested him, and de­  
. tained i‘i)rit for some time a prisoner. He was  
obliged*by the jeopardy of his life, to renounce  
the {ervice of other process, on the weft fide of  
the Alleghany mountain ; and a deputatior was  
afterwards sent him to demand a surrender of  
that which he #4a2d {erved. A numerous body  
repeatedly attacked the houle of the Infﬁc&amp;or,  
seized his papers of office, and fnally deitroyed  
by fire, his buildings, and whatfocver they con­  
fained. Both of thele officers, from a just re­  
- gardto their fafety, fled tothe [eat of government ; |  
1t being avowed, that the motives of such outra­  
fes were, to compel the resignation of the In-  
Apeélor ; to withstand, by force of arms, the  
authority of the United States, and theschy to  
  
~extors a repeal of the laws of excise, and an al­  
teration mn the conduti of government. ,  
~ Upon the telhmony of these faéls, an aflo­  
cizte justice of the Supreme Court of the Um­  
ted States notified to me, that ¢ in the coun­  
ues of Wafhingtonand Alleghany, in Pennsyl­  
vania, laws of the United States were oppoled,  
and the execution thereof obftruéied, by com­  
binations, too powerful to be fupprefled by the  
ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by  
the powervefted in the Marshal of that diftré&amp;t”  
—On this call, momentous in the extreme, 1  
fought and weighed what might best subdue the  
crisis. On&#x27;the one &#x27;hand, the judiciary was  
pronouanced to be ftript of its capacity to enforce  
the laws : Crimes which reached the very exift­  
ance of focial.order, were perpetrated without  
controul ; the friends of government were in­  
{ulted, abused, and overawed into iilence, or an  
apparent acquicicence ; and to yicld so the trea­  
sonable fury of {o small a portion of the United  
States, would be to violate the fundamental  
principle of our conflitution, which enjoins,  
that the will of the majority shall prevail.—On  
the other, to array citizen aga&#x27;m{{) citizen—to  
publith the dithonor of such exceffes—~to en­  
ceunter the expence and other embarraflinents  
ot so diflant an expedition, were fleps too deli­  
cate—too closely interwoven with many affeft­  
-Ing considerations, to be lightly adopted. I  
‘poliponed, therefore, the {&#x27;x.xmxr‘xoningX the mili­  
tia immediately into the field : But required  
them to be held in readiness that it my anxious  
-enideavors to reclaim the deluded, and to con­  
vince the malignant of their danger, thould be  
fruitlefs, military force might be prepared to  
act, before the {eafon fthould be two far advan._  
ced.  
My proclamation of the 7th of August last,  
was accordingly issued, and accompanied by the  
appointment of Commiflioneas, who were char­  
ged to repair to the {cene of infurre@ion—  
They were authorifed to confer with any bo­  
dies of men, or individuals.—They were in­  
ftrufted to be candid and explicit, in slating  
the sensations which had been excited in the  
Executive, and his earnest with to avoid a re­  
sort to ccexcion, to represent, however, that  
without fubmiflion, ccercion mus be the resort ;  
but to invite them, at the fame time, to return  
to the demeanor of faithful citizens, by such  
accommodations as lay within the sphere of  
executive power—pardon, too, was tendered to  
them by the government of the United States,  
and that of Pennsylvania ; upon no other con­  
dition, than a fatisfaélory aflurance of obedience  
to the laws.  
Although the report of the Commiflioners,  
marks their firmnefs and abilities, and must  
unite all virtuous men, by tfhewing that the  
means of conciliation have been exhausted ; all  
of thofe&#x27;who had committed, or abetted the  
tumulcs, did not subscribe the mild form, which  
was proposed as the atonement ; and the indi­  
cations of a peaceable temper were neither fuf­  
ficiently general, nor conclusive to recommend  
or warrant the further fufpeniion of the -march  
of the Mihitia, . :  
  
’ Thus, the painful altemativp could not be  
discarded. 1 ordered the Militia to march,  
after once more admonithing the insurgents, in  
my proclamation of the ¢sth of September last.  
It was a talk, too difhcult to aflcertain with  
precision, the lowest degree of force competent  
to the quelling of the lafurre€tion. From a  
. refpeét, indeed, to ceconomy, and the ease of  
- my fellow-citizens, belonging to the Militia, it  
would have gratified me to accomplith such an  
i estimate. My very great reluftance to ascribe  
- too much importance to the opposition, had its  
extent been accurate&#x27;y {een, would have been a  
decided inducement to the {malleft efficient  
numbers. In this uncertainty, therefore, I put  
into motion fifteen thousand men, as being an  
army, which, according to all human calcula­  
tion, would be prompt and adequate in every  
view, and might perhaps, by rendering refiflance  
’ desperate, prevent the effufion of human biood.  
- QQuotas had been assigned to the States of New,  
Jerley, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virgini ;  
the Governor of Pennsylvania having declared  
on this occasion an opmion which jultified a  
requisition to the other States.  
As Commander in Chief of the Militia,  
when called into the aftual {ervice of the Uni­  
ted States, 1 have visited the places of general  
rendezvous, to obtain more exaét information,  
and to dire€t a plan for ulterior movements.,  
Had there b2cn room for a persuasion that the  
laws were f{ccure from’ obftruction®—-that the  
civil magistrate was able to bring to juflice such  
of the most culpable as have not embraced the  
profiered terms of amncﬁz, and may be deemed  
fit ®bjelts of example ; that the friends of peace  
and good government were not in teed of that  
aid and countenance which they ought always  
‘to receive, and I trust, ever will receive, against  
the vicious and turbulent, I should have caught  
with avidity, the opportunity of restoring the  
Militia to their families and home. But suc­  
ceeding intelligence has tended to manifelt the  
neceflity of what has been done, it being now  
confefled, by those who were not inclined to  
exaggerate the ill condu€t of the insurgents,  
that their malevolence was not pointed merely  
to a-particular law ; but that a {pirit inimical to  
all order has aGtuated many of the offenders.  
- If the state of things had afforded reason for  
the continuance of my presence with the army,  
it would not have been witholden ; but every  
appearance afluring {uch an issue as will redound  
to the reputation and strength of the United  
States-—-lp have judged it most proper to resume  
my duties at the {eatof government, leaving the  
chics command with the Governor of Virginia.  
- Stll, however, as itis probable, thatin a  
commotion like the present, whatever may be  
the pretence, the f)urpofcs,of milchief and re­  
venge may not be laid aside ; the flationing of  
a small force, for a certain period, in the ?our  
weflern counties of Pennsylvania, will be indif­  
penfible, whether we contemplate, the situation  
  
of those who are cohnefled with the execution  
of the laws, or of others, who may have expoled  
themfclves by an honcrable attachment to them,  
~ Thirty days from the commencement of this  
feflion, being the legal limitation of the employ­  
ment of the militia, Congress cannot be too  
early occupied with this fubjeét.  
Among the difcuflions which may arise from  
this afpett of our affairs, and from the docu­  
ments which will be submitted to Congress, it  
will not escape their ebfervation, that not only  
the Infpettor of the Revenue, but other offi­  
cers of the United States, in Pennsylvania, have,  
from their fidelity in the difcHarge of their func.-  
tions, fultained material injuries to their pro­  
perty. The obligation and policy of indemn;i­  
fying themare firong and obvious. 1t may allo  
merit attg:ntion, whether policy will not enlarge  
this provilion to the retribution of our citizens,  
who, though not under the ties of office, may  
have fuffered damage by their generous exer­  
tions for upholding the conflitution and the  
laws. The amount, even if all the injuried  
were inciuded, would not be great ; and on  
future emergencies, the government would be  
amply repaid by the influence of an example  
that he, who incurs a loss in its defence, shall  
{ind 2 recompence in its liberality.  
Whhile there 1s a cause to lament that occur­  
rences of this nature should have disgraced the  
name, or interrupted the tranquility, of any part  
of our community, or should have diverted to  
a new application, any portion of the public re­  
{Surces, there are not wanting real and {ubftan­  
tial consolations for the misfortunc. It has de­  
monstrated that our prosperity refls on solid  
foundations ; by furnifhing an additional proof,  
&#x27; that iy fellow-citizens understand the true prin­  
ciples of government and liberty ; that they  
feel their in{eparable union—-that, notwithfland­  
ing all the devices that have been made use of  
to sway them from their interest and duty, they  
~are now as ready to maintain the authority of  
the laws againit licentious invasions, as they were  
to defend their rights against usurpation. It  
has been a {peftacle displaying to ‘the highelt  
advantage the value of republican government,  
to behold the most and least wealthy of our ci­  
tizens flanding in the fame rank as private {ol­  
diers, pre-eminently diftinguithing by being the  
army of the constitution undeterred by a march  
of three hundred miles, over rugged mountains,  
by the approach of an inclement {eafon, nor by  
any other discouragement. Nor ought I to omit  
to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic co­  
operation which I have experienced from the  
Chief Magistrates of the States to which my re­  
quifinons have been addrefled.  
To every description, indeed, of citizens, let  
praise be given ; but let them persevere in their  
affectionate vigilance over that precious deposi­  
tory of American happiness, the Conflitution  
of the United States. Let them cherish it too,  
for the fake of thole, who from every clime are  
daily fecking a dwelling in our land. And  
‘when, in the calm moments of refleftion, they  
dhall have/retraced the origin and progress of  
the infurreftion, let them determine, whether  
it has not been domented by combinations of  
men, who careless of consequences, and difre­  
‘garding the unerring truth,that those who rouse,  
cannot always appease a civil convulsion, have  
disseminated, from an Ignorance or perversion  
of falls, fulpicions, jealousies and accusations of  
the whole government.  
Having thus fulfilled the engagement which I  
took, when I entered into office, ‘¢ to the bell  
of my ability to preserve, proteftand defend the  
Conflitution of the United States,” on you,  
gentlemen and the people by whom you are de­  
puted, I rely for support.  
In the arrangements to which the poflibility  
of a similar contingency will naturally draw  
your attention, it ought not to be for%ottcn, that  
~the militia laws have exhibited such nking de-  
Tells, as could not have been supplied but by  
the zeal of our citizens. Besides the extraordi­  
‘nary expence, and wafle, which are not the lealt  
_of the defefls ; cvery appeal to the laws is  
-atfended with a doubt on Its success.  
  
.. The deviling and establishing of a well-regu­  
lated miliia would be a genuine source of legis­  
lative homour, and a pertet title to public grati­  
tude. I therefore entertain a hope, that the  
-present session will not pass, without carrying to  
its full energy, the power of organizing, arming  
and dilciplining the Militia ; and thus providing  
in the language of the Constitution, for calling  
them forth to execute the laws of the Union,  
suppress infurreétion, and repel invasion,  
As auxiliary to the slate of our defence to  
- which Congress cannot tod frequently recur,  
they will not omit to enquire whether the forti­  
fications which have been already licensed by  
law, be commensurate with our exigencies.  
The intelligence from the army under the com­  
mand of General WAy NE, is a happy presage  
to our military operations against the hostile In­  
dians North of the Ohio. - From the advices  
which have been forwarded, the advance he  
has made must have damped the ardour of the  
savages, and weakened their obliinacy in waging  
war against the United States ; and yet, eveniat  
this late hour, when our power to punish them .  
cannot be questioned, we thall not be unwilling  
to cement alafling peace, upon terms of candour,  
equity and good neighborhood.  
‘Towards none of the Indian tribes have over­  
tures of friendfhip been spared. The Creeks  
in particular are covered from encroachment by  
the interposition of the General Government,  
and that of Georgia. From a desire also to re­  
move the discontents of the Six Nations, a set­  
tlement meditated at Preflq’lfle, on Lake Erie,  
has been &#x27;fufaendcél ; and an agent is now endea­  
voring to retify any mifconcentions, into wbxgh  
they may have fallen.—But I cannot refrain  
from again pressing upon your deliberations,  
the plan which I recommended at the last session,  
for the improvement of harmony within our  
limits, by the fixing and condufling of trading  
houses, upon the principles then exprefled,  
  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
The time which has elapled since the com­  
mencement of our fhfcal mcalures, has developed  
our rccuniar}-’ resources, so as to opena way for  
a definitive plan for the redemption of our pub­  
lic debt. It is belicved that the result is {uch  
as to encourage Congrels t 6 confumate this  
work without delay. Nathing can more pro­  
mote the permanent welfare of the nation, and  
nothing would be more grateful to our confiitu­  
ents. Indeed whatfocver is unfinifhed of our  
{yftem of public credit cannot be benefitted by  
procrastination, and as far as may be prafticable,  
we ought to place that credit on grounds which  
cannot be disturbed, 2nd to prevent that progrel­  
five accumulation of debt, which muil ultimatcly  
endanger all governments,  
An estimate of the neceflary appropriations  
including the expenditures into which we have  
been driven by the infurie€tion, will be submit­  
ted to Congress.  
Gentl men of the Senate and of the  
Houle of Reprefentativ:s, ‘  
The Mint of the United States has entered  
upon the coinage of the precious metals, and  
considerable sums of defeflive coins and bullion  
have been lodged with the dire&amp;tor by individu­  
als. There 15 a pleasing profpet, that the in­  
fitution will, at no remote day, realize the ex«  
pectation which was originally formed of its  
uulity. ! &#x27;  
Infubfequent communications certain circum­  
flances of our intercourse with foreign nations  
will be tran{mitted to Congrefls ; however, it  
may not be unfcafonable to anncunce, that my  
policy, 1n our fereign tranfaflions, has been,to  
cultivate peace with 21l the world—To observe  
treaties with pure and absolute faith—to check  
cvery diviation from the line of impartiality—  
to explain what may have been misapprehended  
—and correét what may have been injurious to  
any nation ; and having thus acquired the right,  
to lose no time in acquining the 2bility, to insist  
upon juflice being done ourselves.  
Let us umte, therefore in imploring the Su­  
preme Ruler of nations, to spread his holy pro­  
tection over these United States, to turn the  
machinations of the wicked, to the confirmifig  
of our conflitution—to enable us at all times ta  
root out internal sedition, and put invasion to  
flight—to perpetuate to our country that pros­  
perity which his goodness has already conf:ired,  
and to verify the anticipations of this govern­  
ment being a fafeguard to human rights. 4

My proclamation of tbe 7 th of Auguft I a ft  
wis accordingly iffjed, and accompanied by  
the appointment of commiflloncrs, who were  
charged to lepair to the fane of infurreclion.  
They were authotifed to confer with any bo­

llruaed to be candiand explicit, in flating the  
fenfationi, wh.ch hail been excited ir. the Exe­  
cutive, and his earnelt wilh to avoid a refort to  
co eicion $ to represent, however, that without  
iunmiffion, co rrcion tnufi be the refort ; but  
to invite them, at the fame time, to return

accommodations as lay within the fphere of cx­

Thus the painful alternative could not be  
difcarded.  
I oidered the militia to inarch, after once  
more admomming the infurgents in my pro­  
clamation of the 25th ot September lad.  
It vas a talk too difficult to alcertain with  
preciflon the lo well degree of force, competent

re I peel, iodetd, to ceconomy, and the eafe of  
my fellow-cttiien, belonging to the militia,&#x27;  
it would have gratified me to accompli Qi fuch  
an elf unate.

been accurately leen, would nave been a deci­  
ded inducement to the fmallelt efficient num

the houfe of reprefentatives, and detivered  
the following addrefs :  
  
* Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of  
the Houfe of Reprefentatives.  
  
€ When we call to mind the gracious  
indulgence of heaven, by which the A-  
merican people became a nation; when  
we furvey the general profperity of our  
country, and look forward to the rich-s,  
power, and happinefs to which it feems  
deftined ; with the deepeft regret do I an-  
nounce to you, that during your recefs,  
fome of the citizens of the United States  
have been found capable of an infurreétion.  
It is due, however, to the chara&amp;ter of  
our government, and to its ftability, which  
cannot he fhaken by the enemies of order,  
freely to unfold the courfe of this event.  
  
* During the feffion of the year 1790,  
it was expedient to exercife the leg:flative  
  
wer granted by ihe conftitutio of the  
  
nited States, “to lay and collect ex-  
cifes.” In a majority of the ftates, icarce-  
ly an objection was heard to this mode  
of taxation. In fome, indeed, alarms were  
at firit conceived, until they were banifhed  
by reafon and patriotifm. In the four  
weftern counties of Pennfy!vania, a pre-  
judice, fottered and embittered by the ar  
tifice of men who laboured for an afcen-  
dancy over the wiil of others by the  
guidance of their paffions, produced {ymp-  
toms of riot and violence. It is well  
known that congrefs did not hefitate to  
examine the complaints which were pre-  
fented ; and to relieve them, as far as juitice  
digtated, or general convenence would  
permit. But the impreflion which this  
moderation made on the difcontented, did  
not correfpond with what it deferved —  
The arts of delufion were no longer con-  
fined to the efforts of defigning ind viduals.  
The very forbearance to prefs profecutions,  
was milinterpreted into a fear of urging  
the execution of the laws; and affocia-  
tions of men began to denounce threats  
agamit the officers employed. From a  
belief, that, by a mere formal concert,  
their operation might be defeated, certain  
felf-created focieties afflumed the tone of  
condemnation, Hence, while the greater  
  
2  
  
part of Pennfylvania itfelf were conform-  
ing themfelves to the aéts of excife, a  
few counties were refolved to frutirate  
them. It was now perceived that every  
expectation from the tendernefs which had  
been hitherto puriued, was unavailing ¢  
and that farther delay could only create  
an opinion of impotency, or irrefolution,  
in the government. Legal procefs was  
therefore delivered to the mar‘hal, againft  
the noters and delinquent diftilers.  
  
* No fooner was he underflood to be  
engaged in this duty, than the vengeance  
of armed men was aimed at his perton,  
and the pe:fon and property of the in-  
fpector of the revenuc. hey fired upon  
the marfhal, arrefted him, and detained  
him for fome time as a pritoner. He was  
obliged, by the jeopardy of his life, to  
renounce the fervice of other procefles on  
the weit fide of the Alleghany Mountain 5  
and a deputation was afterward fent to  
him, to demand a furrender of that which  
he had ferved. A numerous body re-  
pea&#x27;edly attacked the houle of the in-  
ipector, fPized his papers of office, and  
finally deftrey-d by five his buildings,  
and whatloever they contained. Both of  
thefe officers, from a juft regard to their  
fafety, fled to the fe+t of government, it  
being avowed, that the motives of fuch  
outrages were to compel the refignation  
of the in{pe&amp;tor; to withftand by force  
of arms the authority of the United States,  
and thereby to extort a repeal of the laws  
of excife, and an alteratiun in the con-  
dué&amp; of government.  
  
‘Upon the teftimony of thefe fas,  
an aflociate juftice. of the fupreme court  
of the Unital States notified to me, “ That  
in the counties of Wathington and Al-  
leghany in Pennfylvania, the laws of the  
United States were oppofed, and the ex-  
ecution thereof obitructed by combina-  
tions, too powerful to be fupprefled by  
the ordinary courfe of judicial proceedings,  
or by the powers vetted in the murfhal  
of that diftri&amp;.””? On this call, momen-  
tous in the extreme, I fought and weigh-  
ed what might beft fubdue the crifis. On  
the one hand, the judictary was pronoun-  
ced to be tripped of its capacity to en-  
force the laws; crimes, which reached  
the very exiftence of focial order, were  
perpetrated without controul ; the friends  
of government were infulted, abufed, and  
over-awed into filence, or an apparent  
acquiefcence ; and to yield to the trcaion-

My proctamation of the 7h of Au-  
guit lali, was according&#x27;y iflued, and ac-  
companied by the appomtmeni of com-  
mifhioners, who were charged to repair  
to the fcene of infurrection. They were  
authoriltd to conter with any bodies of  
men or individuals. They were infti ué-  
ed to be candid and ex&gt;licit, in ftating  
the fentatioes which had been excited m  
the execot.ve, ond his euncft with to  
avoid a refort to evercion: to repreicnt,  
however, ‘hat, without iubmifiion, coer  
cion muft be the rlort; but to invite  
them, at the fame time, to return to the  
demeanour of fu1ihtul citizens, by fuch  
accommodations as lay within the {phere  
of executive power. P rdon tuo was ten-  
dered 10 them by the government of the  
United States, and that of Penniylvania;  
rpen no other condition, than a fatus-  
f.étory affurance of obed-ence to the laws.

was piopoled as the atenement; ard the

neither iuficiently general nor conclufve,

* It was a talk too dificult to afcertain  
with prec fion the Jowett degree of toice  
competent to the quelling of the infur-  
  
  
  
  
  
reétion. From a refpeét, indeed, to eco-  
nomy, and the tare of my tellow-cit-zens  
belonging to the milria, it would have  
gratthed me to accomplifh an ettimate.—  
My great reluctince to alertbe too much  
importance to the oppofition, had its ex-  
tent been accurately teen, would have  
been a decided mducement to the {mallet  
efiicient numbers. in this vneerainty,  
therefore, I put into motion 15,000 men,  
as beng an army wh.ch, according to  
alk human c.leulation, would be prompt  
and adequate in every view, and might,  
perhaps, by rendering refiltance deipriate,  
prevent the eifufion of bleod. Quotas  
had been afligned to the ftates of New  
Jerfey, Pennfylvania, Maryland, and Vir-

I thould have canght wih avidity that

now confeffed by thofe who were not m-  
clined to exaggerate the il conduct of the  
infurgents, that the:r malevolence was not  
pointed to a particular law, but that a  
fpirit inimical &#x27;o all order has a€tuated  
many of the offenders. If the ftate of  
things had afforded rea‘on of the conti-

would not have ceen withholden. But  
every appearance affuriug fuch an iffue  
as will redound to the reputation and

(lability, which cannot be fhaken  
by the enemies of order, freely to  
unfold the coorfe of ibis event.  
  
Din ing the felliou of the ) ear

|by the conuitution of the United

fcurcely an objection v. as heard  
to this mode of taxation. In foine,  
in leed, alarms were at full con-  
ceived, until they were baui Ihc I  
by reafon and parrbrifm. In the  
four weflem counties ofPennfyU  
vaaia, a prejudice, foltcied and  
% imbi.tcrcd by the artifice of me::,  
• who laboured for an afcendei.cy  
over the will of others, by the  
guidance of their patlions, produ-  
ced fymptonis of riot and violence.  
It is well known, that COngreft  
did not hclitate to examine the  
k complaints, which were prefented,  
and to relieve them, as far as jof.  
tice dictated, or general conveni-  
ence would permit; but the im-  
preftfen, which this moderation  
made on the diirc-.ter.ted, did not  
cprretpon !, with what it deferved.  
v The arts of dciufion were no ion-  
, \ger confined to the effort:.! of deligt.-

a Jew counties were tefolved to  
frustrate them. It was now pet-  
rel that every expectation

petty of the inlpceior of the ce-  
venue. Tiiey fired upon the mar-  
arretted hi:n, and detained

He was obliged by the jeopardy  
of hislile, to renounce the lei vice  
of other nrocefs, on the weft fide  
of the Ailegany mountain ; and a  
deputation wiu. afterwards feat to  
him to demand a fur/endeer of  
that which he h*d fcfved. A mi-  
mecous Lody repca edly attacked  
the ho. lie of the infpector,— feized  
his papers of office, — and finally  
destroyed hy fne, his buildings,  
and whatfoever they contained.  
Both of thefe otlicers, from a juit

ther fnuM kiuly gene al, nor eon-  
ciu&amp;re, to recomtaeoil or warrant,  
the farther fufpenilon of the march  
Of the militia.  
  
Thus, tiie painful alternative  
could not bedtftarded. I orde.cd  
the militia to march, afrer once  
more admo^iining the infurgents,  
In my proclamation of the 25th of  
September la!t.  
  
It way a talx too dlfiicult to af-  
certain/with precifion, rhe lowetl  
degre&gt; of forte, competent to the*  
que J&#x27;.u&#x27;v of the infnrrection. ICrom  
0 lcfpect, indeccf, to occonoiny,  
atnt tise eafe of my fellow citi- » -  
/e is belonging to the militia, it •  
v ould have gratified me to accoin-  
pliih fuch an cltimatc. My very  
reluctance to afcrR&gt;e too much hn-  
povtaitce to the oppiition, l.adAu  
extent been accurately fecn, we™  
have been a decided inducement  
  
to llic fmallcfi. efficient nmnhcrs.  
In this uncertainty, the.efoie, I  
put into motion liitce.i thoufand  
men, as being an army, which, ac-  
cording to all human calculation,  
would be prompt, and adeo^nate in  
•every view ; and might perhaps,  
by rendering icnllance defperatc,  
prevent the cifuhon of blood. Quo-  
tas had been ailigned to the ltaies  
of New-Jerfey, Fcnnfylvania, ma-  
ry land, and Virginia ; the gover-  
nor of peHnfylvania having decla-  
red on this occalion, an opinion  
which jultificd a roquifitioa to the  
other Hate?.  
  
As commander in chief of the  
militia, v.hen called into the ac-  
tual fervice of the United States,  
I have vifited the places of ge-  
general rendezvous, to obtain  
more exac&#x27;t information, and to  
direct a plttn for ulterior move-  
ments. Had there been room for  
a perflation, that the laws were  
fecure fi o n obili uciion ; tliat the  
civil magillratc was able to bring  
to jultice fucn of the moll culpable  
as have not embraced ihe prole ed  
. terms of amnelty, and may be  
» deemed fit objects of example ;  
•that the fi lends to peace and g&lt; od  
government weie not in Deed of  
that aid and countenance, which  
they ought always to receive, and  
1 trult, t\cr will receive, againit  
the vicious and tui bulent ; 1 mould  
have caught with avidity the o;,;-  
pcrtunity of leltorirg the militia  
- to their families and homes, but  
\ fucceeding intelligence has tended  
Vto maniielt the neceffity of what  
  
has been done ; ic being now con-  
felled by thofc who were not incli-  
ned to exaggerate the ill-con:luct k  
of the infurgents, that their 1  
volence was not pointed mefeT  
to a paiticular law; but that  
Ipirit, inimical to all order, \\4  
actuated many of the offenders. If  
the ltate of things had afforded  
reafon for «he continuance of my  
pielcice v\i;h the army, it would  
not have been withhoiden. Hut  
every appearance alluring fuch an  
ill ue, as w ill redound to the repu-  
tation and llrength of the United  
States, 1 have judged it molt pro-  
per, toiefume my duties at the  
feat of government, leaving the  
chief command witli the governor  
of Virginia-  
Still, however, as it is probable,  
that in a commotion like the p: c-  
fent, whatfoever nuty be the pre-  
tence, the pur poles of mifchiert  
  
and revenge may not be laid afide &#x27;j I  
the fifatiooing a fii»all force for a •  
certain period in tiie four weltenar^ ment,  
counties of PertoCylvania will be ed int&lt;  
in di (pen bible ; whether we con-  
tenii)late the fituation of thofe,  
who ate connected with the exe-  
cution of the laws ; or of others  
who may have cxpofed themfelves  
by an honorable attachment to  
them. Thirty days from the com-  
mencement of this fellion, being;  
the legal limitation of the employ-  
ment of the militia, Congrefs can-  
not be too early occupied with this  
subject.  
  
Among the difcuflions, which  
may arife from this afpect of our  
arians, and from the documents  
which will be fubmitted to Con-  
grefs, it will not elcape their ob-  
lervaiion, that not only the in-  
fpector of the tCveaue, but other  
ameers of the United States in  
Fennfylvania have, from thir (Ide-  
I.ty in ihe -difcharge of their func-  
tions, fultained material ininries  
to their pronei ty. The obligati-  
on and policy of indemnifying  
them are llrong and obvious. It  
may alfo merit attention, whether  
policy will not enlaige this provt.  
lion to the retribution of other  
citizens, who, though not under  
the ties of olhce, may have fujfer-  
ed damage by their generous exer-  
tions for upholding the cooitituti-  
011 and the laws. The amount, e-  
\en if all the injured were includ-  
ed, would not be great ; and Vm  
future emergencies, the govi  
ment would be amply repair

monftrated, that our profportty  
rells on lolid foundations : by fu, -

liberty t — that they feel their in-

Handing all the devices which have  
been tiled to fway them from their

ready to maintain the authority of  
the laws againit licentious invafi-  
ons, as they were to defend their  
rights agalnft uforpation. It has  
been a fpec&#x27;tacle, dilplaying to the  
blgheft advantage, the value of re-  
publican government, to behold  
the molt and the leaft wealthy of  
our citizens {landing in the fame

deterted by a march of three hun-  
dred miles over rugged piountains,  
by the approach of an inclement  
tearfoft, or by any other difcon-  
ragemcnt. Nor ought I to omit to  
acknowledge the eflicacious and  
]&gt;a; . iotic co-operation, which 1 have  
experienced from the chief magif-  
ftrates of the Hates, to which ;.iy  
requifitions have been addreiled.  
  
e y defcription, indeed, of  
citizens let prajfe be given. Hut  
let them peiTevere in their aft&#x27;ecti-  
onate vigilance over that piccious  
tlepolitory of American hanpinefs,  
the conliitution of the united  
States, Let them cheiilh it too,  
for the fake of thole, w ho from e  
very clime are daily feej&amp;ing a  
dwelling in our land. Anil when  
in the calm moments of reflection,  
they ihall have retraced the origin  
and progrefs at the infurrection,  
let them cfetermine whether it has  
nut been fomented by combinati-  
ons of men, who, carelels of confe-  
quences, and difregarding the un-  
ci 1 ing truth, that thofc who roufe,  
cannot always appeafe a ci.il con-  
vullion — have dillemina^ed, from  
an ignorance or pervei (ion of fae&#x27;rs,  
fufpicions, jcaloulics, and accufati-  
ons of the whole government.  
Havingthns fulfilled the en gage -  
hich I took, when I eater-  
ito olhce, &quot; to the bell of my  
ability to preferve, protect and de-  
lend the conliitution of the United  
States,&quot; o» you, Gentlemen, and  
the people by whom you are de-  
puted, 1 rely for fupport.  
  
In the arrangements! to wnich  
the polJibility of a limilar contin-  
gency Will naturally draw your at-  
tention, it ought not ro be forgot-  
ten, that the militia laws&gt;ha l e ex-  
hibited fuch Iti iking del&#x27;cc&#x27;ls, ad  
could not have been fupplied but  
by the zeal of our citizens. Befides  
the extraordinary expenfe and  
walte, which are not the lead of  
the defects, every appeal to thofe  
laws is attended with a doubt  
on its faccefs.  
  
The deviivng and e&#x27;.tablill.ing of  
a well regulated militia, would be  
a genuine feurce of lcgifiative ho-  
nor, and a perfect title to public  
gratitude. I, therefore, entertain  
a hope, that the pre rent fedro;i  
will not pals, without carrying to.  
its f ull energy ;h« power of or-  
ganiziug, arming and disciplining

As auxilary to the flate of our  
defence, to which Cong efs can/  
never too frequently recur, they  
■will not omit to enquires whether  
the fortifications, which have bee it  
already licenced by law, be cotn-

GeneRAL WasHiINGTON somewhere says, ‘ that the devising

source of legislative honor, and a perfect title to public grati-

nounce a decisive opinion on this subject, than this illustrious  
warrior. He spoke with the experience of the Revolution  
still fresh on his mind, and he well knew all the defects of  
this arm of our national defence, as well as the efficacy of  
which, under proper laws and regulations, it was suscepti-

complaints which were presented, and to relievo

itliith this moderation made on the discontented,  
not correspond with what it deserved ; the  
aits of delusion were no longer confined to the  
..Torts ofdesicnins individuals.  
The very forbearance to press prosecutions  
nasmitinicrprelcd into a fear of urging the exe­  
cution of t ho laws ; and associations of men he­  
wn to drnnunce threats against the officers em- I  
ployed. From a belief, that by a. more formal  
concert, tlieir operation might ue deleated, cer­  
uin self-created societies assumed the tone of  
condemnation. Hence, while the greater part of  
Pennsylvania itself were conforming themselves  
to the acts of excise, a few counties were resolv­  
ed to frustrate them. It was now perceived that  
every expectation from the tenderness which  
had been hitherto pursued, was unavailing, and  
that further delay could only create an opinion  
ofinipolency or irresolution in the government.  
Legal process was, therefore, delivered to the  
marshal, against the rioters and delinquent dis­  
tillers.Nosooncr was he understood to be engaged in  
this duty, than the vengeance of armed melt Was  
aimed at his person, mid the person and proper­  
ty of the inspector of the revenue. They fired  
upon the marshal, arrested him, and detained  
him for some time, ns a prisoner. . He was obli­  
ged, by the jeopardy of his life, to announce the  
service of other process, on the west side oT the  
Alleghany mountain ; and deputation was af­  
terwards sent to him to demand u surrender of  
that which he had served. A humorous body  
repeatedly attacked the house of the inspector,  
iznd his papers of office, am) finally destroyed  
by fire, his build intra, and u lintsopver ihev con  
tained. Both of these officers, from a just re­  
gird to their safety, fled to the seat of govcrn­  
Uent; it being avowed, that the motives to such  
outrages were to compel the resignation of the  
inspector: to withstand by force of arms the  
authority of the United States, and thereby to  
extort a repeal of the laws of excise, and an al­  
teration in the conduct of government.  
ponthe testimony of these facts, an nsso­  
ciate justice of the Supreme Court of the United  
Slates notified to me, that &quot; in the counties of  
Washington and Alleghany, in Pennsylvania,  
,aws of the United States were opposed, and the  
&quot;ecution thereof obstructed by combinations,  
too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary  
curso of judicial proceedings, or by the powers  
vted in the marshal of that district.&quot; On this  
momentous in the extreme, I sought and  
ighed what might best subdue the crisis. On  
ne one hand, the judiciary was pronounced to  
siript of its capacity to enforce the laws:  
crimes, which reached the very existence of so­  
!??&#x27; order, were perpetrated without control ; the  
&quot;ends of government were insulted, abused, and  
0VtMawed &#x27;&quot;to silence, or an apparent acquies­  
cence; and to yield to the treasonable fury of so  
small a portion of the United States, would be to  
folate the fundamental principle of our constitu­  
&quot;on, which enjoins that the will of the majority  
sha prevail. On the other, to array citizen  
against citizen to publish the dishonoui of such  
j-cess to encounter the expense, and other em­  
arrasments of so distant an expedition, were  
81eps too delicate, too closely interwoven with  
many affectintr considerations, to be liehtl v adoDt-  
l I postponed, therefore, the summoning of  
&quot;iiiitia immediately into tne held ; but I re­  
liirerj them to be held in readiness, that if my  
  
anxious endeavours to reclaim the deluded, and  
to convince the malignant of their danger, should  
  
be fruitless, military lorce might be prepared to  
act, before the season should be too far advanced.  
My proclamation of the 7th of August last Was  
accordingly issued, and accompanied by the ap­  
pointment of commissioners, who are charged to  
repair to the scene of insurrection. They were  
authorized to confer with any bodies of men, or  
individuals. They were instructed to be candid  
and explicit, in stating the sensations which h3d  
been excited in the Executive, and his earnest  
wish to avoid a resort to coercion ; to represent,  
however, that without submission coercion must  
be the resort; but to invite then.,&#x27; at the same  
time, to return to the demeanor of faithful citi­  
zens, by such accommodations as lay within the  
sphere of executive power. Pardon, too, was  
tendered to them by the government of the Uni­  
ted States, and that of Pennsylvania, upon no  
other condition, than a satisfactory assurance of  
obedience to the laws.  
Although the report of the commissioners  
marks their firmness and abilities, and must unite  
all virtuous men, by showing that the means of  
conciliation have been exhausted, all of those  
who had committed or abetted the tumults did  
not subscribe the mild form, which was proposed  
as the atonement ; and the indications of a peace  
able temper were neither sufficiently general nor  
conclusive, to recommend or warrant the further  
suspension of the march of the militia. -  
Thus the painful alternative could not be dis­  
carded. I ordered the militia lo murch, after  
once more admonishing the insurgents, in my  
proclamation of the 25th of September last.  
It was a task too difficult to ascertain with  
precision, the lowest degree of force competent  
to the quelling of the insurrection. From a re­  
spect, indeed, to economy and the ease of my  
fellow citizens belonging to the militia, it would  
have gratified me to accomplish such an estimate.  
My very reluctance to ascribe too much impor­  
tance to the opposition, had its extent been ac­  
curately seen, would have been i decided induce­  
ment to the smallest efficient numbers. In this  
uncertainty, therefore, I put into motion fifteen  
thousand men, as being n army, which, accord­  
ing to all human calculation, would be prompt,  
and adequate in every view, and might perhaps,  
by rendering resistance desperate, prevent the  
effusion of blood. Quotas had been assigned to  
the Slates of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mary­  
land, and Virginia; the governor of Pennsylva­  
nia having declined on this occasion, an opinion  
which justified a i requisition to the other States.  
As commander-in-chief of the miiitia, when  
called into the actual service of the United Slates,  
I have visited the places of general rendezvous,  
to obtain more exact information, and to direct  
a plan for ulterior movements. Had there been  
room for a persuasion that the laws were secure  
from obstruction ; that the civil magistrate was  
able to bring to justice such of the most culpable  
as have not embraced the proffered terms of am­  
nesty, and may be deemed lit objects of example,  
that the fiiends to poace and good government  
were not in need of that aid and countenance,  
which they ought always to receive, and I trust  
ever will receive, against I lie vicious and turbu  
lent, I should have caught with avidity the op­  
portunity of restoring the militia to their families  
and homes. But succeeding intelligence has  
tended to manifest the necessity of what has been  
done it being now confessed by those who were  
not inclined to exaggerate the ill conduct of the  
insurgents, that their iniilevolence was not pointed  
merely to a particular law; but that a spirit inimi­  
cal to nil order, has actuated many of the offend­  
ers. If the state of things had affor led reason  
for the continuance of my presence with the ar­  
my, it would not have been- withholden. But  
every appearance assuiing such an issue, ns wiJI  
redound to the teputalion and strength of the  
United States, I have judged it most proper to  
resume my duties at the seat of govei nment, leav­  
ing the chief command with the governor of  
Virginia.  
Still, however as it is probable, that in a com  
motion like the present, whatsoever may be the  
pretence, the purposes of mischief and revenge  
may not be laid aside, the stationing of a small  
force for a certain period in the four western  
counties of Pennsylvania will bo indispensable,  
whether we contemplate the situation ol those  
who are connected with the execution of the  
laws, or of others who may have exposed them­  
selves bv an honourable attachment to them.  
Thirty oays from the commencement of this  
session, being the legal limitation of the employ  
ment of the militia, Congress cannot be too early  
occupied with this subject.  
Among the discussions which may arise from  
this aspect of our affairs, and from the documents  
which will be submitted to Congress, it will not  
escape their observation, that not only the in­  
spector of the revenue, but other officers of the  
United States in Pennsylvania, have from their  
fidelity in the discharge of tlieir functions, sus­  
tained material injuries, to their property. The  
obligation and policy of indemnifying them are  
strong and obvious. It may also merit attention,  
whether policy will not enlarge this provision to  
the retribution of other citizens, who, though not  
under the tics of office, may have suffered damage  
by their generous exertions for upholding the  
constitution and the laws. The amount, even if  
all the injuied were included, would not be great;  
and on future emergencies, the government would  
be amply repaid by the influence of an example,  
that he who incurs a loss in its defence, shall find  
a recompense in its liberality.  
While there is a cause to lament, that occur­  
rences of this nature should have disgraced the  
name, or interrupted the tranquility of any part  
of our community, or should have diverted to a  
new application, any portion of the public resour­  
ces, there are not wanting real and substantial  
consolation for the misfortune. It has demon­  
strated, that our prosperity rests on solid founda­  
tions, bvfuriiishinff an additional proof, that my  
fellow citizens understand the true principles of  
government and liberty ; that, notwithstanding all  
the devices which have teen used sway them  
  
from their interest and duty they are no w as ready  
  
to maintain Ihe authority of the laws against licen­  
tious invasions, as they were to defend tlieir rights  
against usurpation. It has been a spectacle, dis­  
playing the highest advantage, the value of re­  
publican government to behold the most and the  
least wealthy of our citizens standing in the same  
ranks as private Soldiers prc-emineitly dis­  
tinguished by being the army of the constitution,  
undeterred by a march of three hundred miles  
over rugged mountains, by the approach of an  
inclement season, or by any other discourage­  
ment. Nor ought I to omit to acknowledge the  
efficacious and patriotic co-operation, which I  
have experienced from the chief magistrates of  
tho states to which my requisitions have been  
addressed. . ,  
To every description, indeed, of citizens, let  
prnise be given; but let them persever in their  
affectionate vigilance over that precious deposito­  
ry of American happiness, ihe Constitution of  
the United Stales. Let them cherish it loo, for  
the sake of those, who from every climo are dai­  
ly seeking a dwelling in our land. And when in  
the calm moments of reflection, they sli.ill have  
retraced the oiigin and progress of the nisnnec­  
lion, let them determine whether it has not been  
fomented by combinations of men, who, careless  
of consequences, and disregarding the unerring  
truth, that those who rouse, cannot always ap­  
pease a civil convulsion, have disseminated, from  
an ignorance or perversion of facts, suspicions,  
jealousies, and accusations of the whole go  
vernment.  
Having thus fulfilled the engagement, which I  
took, when I entered into office, &quot; to the best of  
my ability to preserve, protect, and defend the  
Constitution of the United States,&quot; on you, gen­  
tlemen, and the people by whom you are depu­  
ted, 1 rely for support.  
In the arrangements to which the possibility of  
a similar contingency will naturally draw your  
attention, it ought not to be forgotten, that the  
militia laws have exhibited such striking d. l ets,  
as could not have been supplied but by the zeal  
of our citizens. Besides the extraordinary ex­  
pense and waste, which ate not the least of the  
defocts, every appeal lo thoso laws is attended  
with a doubt on its success.  
The devising and establishing of a well re  
gulated militia, would be a genuine source of  
legislative honor, and perfect title to public gra­  
titude. I therefore, i ntcrtain a hope, that the  
present session will not pass, nitliout cat ty ing lo  
its full energy the power of organizing, arming,  
and disciplining tlif militia? and thus providing,  
in the language of the constitution, for calling them  
forth to execute the laws of the Union, suppress  
insurrections, and repel invasions.

associate justice of the Supreme Court of

FkLLOW-CItIzEns oF The SENate

When we call to mind the gracious  
indulgence of Heaven, by which the  
American people became a nation;  
when we survey the general pros­  
perity of our country, and look for,  
ward to the riches, power, and hap

with the deepest regret do I announce  
to you, that during your recess, some

of the citizens of the United States  
have been found capable of an in-  
eurrection. It to dao tomreten a  
surrection. It is due, however,  
the character of our government, and  
to its stability, which cannot beto  
ee a ee  
  e  o   
event.  
Tnin t aacten f at  
During the session of the year,  
1790, it was expedient to exercise  
legislative power, granted by the  
Constitution of the Haited States  
e  
to lay and collect excises.&quot; In a  
majority of the States, scarcely an  
objection was made to this mode of of  
taxation. In some, indeed, alarms  
were at first conceived, until they  
were banished by reason and patri-  
otism. In the four Western counties  
eiee o e oeeee  
eo a e  
ed and embittered by the artilice of  
men, who labored for an ascendaney  
e eoee  
eee  
e wiof others by the gu  
f their passions, produced  
symptoms of riot and violence. It  
is well known, that Congress did not  
henitat to evamine the omnlatnts  
which were presented, and to reliove  
them, as far as justice dictated, or  
oltat t atiii t coiil  
gronovel oonsoniered ssoult tout

 e aoee   
lid not correspond with what it  
deserved; the arts of delusion were  
no longer confined to the effirte of  
e e a  
The very forbearance to press,  
prosecutions was misinterpreted into  
a fear of urging the execution of  
laws; and associations of men began  
to denounce threats against the offf  
amnuloeed. Froma hollot thut  
by a more formal concert, their op-  
eration might be defeated, certain  
pedT t a oeriel, that,  
societies assumed the  
ne of condemnation. Hence, while  
the greater part of Pennsylvania!  
itself wose a itee e ee

No sooner was he understood to  
be engaged in this duty, than the  
vengeance of armed men was aimed  
at his person, and the person and  
property of the Inspector of the rev.  
enue. They fired upon the Marshal,  
ae notod him and dototed liny tn

some time as a prisoner. 16 was  
obliged, by the juonardy of his lite  
to renounce the service of other aro

as afterwards sent to him to da

had served. A numerous body re  
peatedly attacked the house of the

and finally destroyed,

the seat of government. it hoin

asnwed that the motives to such  
outrages were to compel the resign  
ation of the Inspector, to withstand,  
y force of arms, the authority of  
hy toree nf aets the attlrorty   
the United States, and thereby to  
to  
extort a repeal of the laws of excise,  
and an alteration in the conduct of  
government  
rnment.  
Upon the testimony of these facts  
an associate Justice of the Supreme  
Court of the United States notified  
aete o o o  
clourt of the Haled aai ua  
Court of the United States notified  
to me, that &quot;in the counties of Wash

aa on tat ii n this  
momentous in the extreme, I  
an ten tam i ti catrie,  
sought and weighed what might best  
subdue the crisis.  
On the one hand,  
the judiciary was pronounced to be  
stripped of its capacity to enforce the  
aes; crimes, which reached the very  
existence of social order, were per  
petrated without control; the friends  
government were insulted, abused,  
and overawed into silence or an ap-  
parent acquiescence; and to yield to  
the treasonable fury of so small a  
portion of the United States, would  
be to violate the fundamental prinment  
ciple of our Constitution, which en  
joins, that the will of the majority  
shall prevail. On the other, to array  
citizen againet citizen, to publish the  
dishonor of such excesses, to encoun­  
ter the expense and other embar  
rassments of so distant an expedition,  
were steps tho delicate, too closely  
interwoven with many affecting con­  
siderations, to be lightly adopted.  
I postponed, therefore, the summon­  
ing of the militia immediately into  
the field; but I required them to be  
held in readiness, that, if my anxious  
endeavors to reclaim the deluded,  
and to convince the malignant of  
their danger, should be fruitless,

act, before the season should be too

We quote the message entire, as printed in our little old  
newspaper:  
  
* Gentlemen of the Senate and the House of Representatives :  
  
“The Mint of the United States has entered upon the coinage  
of the precious metals, and considerable sums of defective coins  
and bullion have been lodged with the Director by individuals.  
There is a pleasing prospect that the institution will, at no re-  
mote day, realize the expectation which was origiually formed  
of its utility.  
  
“In subsequent communications, certain circumstances of our  
intercourse with foreign nations will be transmitted to Congress.  
However, it may not be unseasonable to announce that my pol-  
icy in our foreign transactions has been to cultivate peace with  
  
all the world; to observe Treaties with pure and absolute faith;  
tocheck every deviation from the line of impartiality; to ex-  
plain what may have been misapprehended, and correct what  
may have been injurious to any nation—and having thus ac-  
quired the right to lose no time in acquiring the ability to insist  
upon justice being done to ourselves. °  
  
“Let us unite, therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of  
Nations to spread his holy protection over these United States;  
to turn the machinations of the wicked to the confirming of our  
Constitution—to enable us at all times to root out internal sedi-  
tion, and put invasion to flight—to perpetuate to our country  
that prosperity which his goodness has already conferred, and  
to verify the anticipations of this Government being a safe-  
guard to human rights.  
  
“GO. WASHINGTON
