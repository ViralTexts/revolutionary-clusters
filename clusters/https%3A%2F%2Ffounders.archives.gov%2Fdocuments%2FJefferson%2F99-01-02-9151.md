 you she is well. mr Bankhead has consented to go &amp; pursue his studies at Monticello, &amp; live with us till his pursuits or circumstances may require a separate establishment. your situation, thrown at such a distance from us &amp; alone, cannot but give us all, great anxieties for you. as much has been secured for you, by your particular position and the acquaintance to which you have been recommended, as could be done towards shielding you from the dangers which surround you. but thrown on a wide world, among entire strangers without a friend or guardian to advise so young too &amp; with so little experience of mankind, your dangers are great, &amp; still your safety must rest on yourself. a determination never to do what is wrong, prudence, and good humor, will go far towards securing to you the estimation of the world. when I recollect that at 14. years of age, the whole care &amp; direction of myself was thrown on myself entirely, without a relation or friend qualified to advise or guide me, and recollect the various sorts of bad company with which I associated from time to time, I am astonished I did not turn off with some of them, &amp; become as worthless to society as they were. I had the good fortune to become acquainted very early, with some characters of very high standing, and to feel the incessant wish that I could ever become what they were. under temptations &amp; difficulties, I would ask myself what would Dr. Small, mr Wythe, Peyton Randolph do in this situation? what course in it will ensure me their approbation? I am certain that this mode of deciding on my conduct tended more to it’s correctness than any reasoning powers I possessed. knowing the even &amp; dignified line they pursued, I could never doubt for a moment which of two courses would be in character for them. whereas seeking the same object through a process of moral reasoning, &amp; with the jaundiced eye of youth, I should often have erred. from the circumstances of my position I was often thrown into the society of horse racers, cardplayers, foxhunters, scientific &amp; professional men, and of dignified men; and many a time have I asked myself, in the enthusiastic moment of the death of a fox, the victory of a favorite horse, the issue of a question eloquently argued at the bar or in the great council of the nation, well, which of these kinds of reputation should I prefer? that of a horse jockey? a foxhunter? an Orator? or the honest advocate of my country’s rights? be assured my dear Jefferson, that these little returns into ourselves, this self-cathechising habit, is not trifling, nor useless, but leads to the prudent selection &amp; steady pursuit of what is right. I have mentioned good humor as one of the preservatives of our peace &amp; tranquility. it is among the most effectual, and it’s effect is so well imitated and aided artificially by politeness, that this also becomes an acquisition of first rate value. in truth, politeness is artificial good humor, it covers the natural want of it, &amp; ends by rendering habitual a substitute nearly equivalent to the real virtue. it is the practice of sacrificing to those whom we meet in society all the little conveniences &amp; preferences which will gratify them, &amp; deprive us of nothing, worth a moment’s consideration; it is the giving a pleasing &amp; flattering turn to our expressions which will conciliate others, and make them pleased with us as well as themselves. how cheap a price for the good will of another! when this is in return for a rude thing said by another, it brings him to his senses, it mortifies &amp; corrects him in the most salutary way, and places him at the feet of your good nature in the eyes of the company. but in stating prudential rules for our government in society I must not omit the important one of never entering into dispute or argument with another. I never yet saw an instance of one of two disputants convincing the other by argument. I have seen many of their getting warm, becoming rude, &amp; shooting one another. conviction is the effect of our own dispassionate reasoning, either in solitude, or weighing within ourselves dispassionately what we hear from others standing uncommitted in argument ourselves. it was one of the rules which above all others made Doctr. Franklin the most amiable of men in society, ‘never to contradict any body.’ if he was urged to anounce an opinion, he did it rather by asking questions, as if for information, or by suggesting doubts. when I hear another express an opinion, which is not mine, I say to myself, he has a right to his opinion, as I to mine; why should I question it. his error does me no injury, and shall I become a Don Quisoet to bring all men by force of argument to one opinion? if a fact be mistated, it is probable he is gratified by a belief of it, &amp; I have no right to deprive him of the gratification. if he wants information he will ask it, &amp; then I will give it in measured terms; but if he still believes his own story, &amp; shews a desire to dispute the fact with me, I hear him &amp; say nothing. it is his affair not mine, if he prefers error. there are two classes of disputants most frequently to be met with among us. the first is of young students just entered the threshold of science, with a first view of it’s outlines, not yet filled up with the details, &amp; modifications which a further progress would bring to their knolege.   the other consists of the ill-tempered &amp; rude men in society who have taken up a passion for politics. (good humor &amp; politeness never introduce into mixed society a question on which they foresee there would be a difference of opinion.) from both of these classes of disputants, my dear Jefferson, keep aloof, as you would from the infected subjects of yellow fever or pestilence. consider yourself, when with them, as among the patients of Bedlam needing medical more than moral counsel. be a listener only, keep within yourself, and endeavor to establish with yourself the habit of silence especially in politics. in the fevered state of our country, no good can ever result from any attempt to set one of these fiery zealots to rights either in fact or principle. they are determined as to the facts they will believe and the opinions on which they will act. get by them therefore as you would by an angry bull: it is not for a man of sense to dispute the road with such an animal. you will be more exposed than others to have these animals shaking their horns at you, because of the relation in which you stand with me. full of political venom, and willing to see me &amp; to hate me as a chief in the antagonist party, your presence will be to them what the vomit-grass is to the sick dog, a nostrum for producing ejaculation. look upon them exactly with that eye, and pity them as objects to whom you can administer only occasional ease. my character is not within their power. it is in the hands of my fellow citizens at large, and will be consigned to honor or infamy by the verdict of the republican mass of our country, according to what themselves will have seen, not what their enemies and mine shall have said. never therefore consider these puppies in politics as requiring any notice from you, &amp; always shew that you are not afraid to leave my character to the umpirage of public opinion. look steadily to the pursuits which have carried you to Philadelphia, be very select in the society you attach yourself to. avoid taverns, drinkers, smokers &amp; idlers &amp; dissipated persons generally; for it is with such that broils &amp; contentions arise, and you will find your path more easy and tranquil. the limits of my paper warn me that it is time for me to close with my affectionate Adieux.

Your situation at such a distance from us  
and alone, cannot but give us all great anxie­  
ties for you. As much has been secured for-^  
you, by your particular position and the ac­  
quaintance to which you have been rec«m- |  
mended, as could be done towards shielding ^  
you from the dangers which surround you.—  
But thrown on a wide world, among entiij,  
strangers, without a friend or guardian to ad­  
vise, so young too, and with so little experi­  
ence of mankind, your dangers are great, and  
still your safety must res’ oti yourself. A de1*  
lermina&#x27;ion never to do what is wrong, pru­  
dence and good humor, will go far towards se­  
cuting to you the estimation of the world.  
When I recollect that at fourteen years of age,  
the whole ca.e and direition of mysell was  
thrown on mvself entirely, without a relation  
or friend qualified to advise or guide me. and ,  
recollect &#x27;he various sorts of had company,  
with whirh I associated from ime 10 timi I  
am astonished I did not ’urn off with some of  
them, and become as worthless &#x27;o sorie’v as  
they vv» r&lt;- 1 bad the good tor’Utie to b* come  
acqu tinted very t-atly with some characen  
of verv high standing, and to ferl &#x27;lie inces­

weie Unde temptations and diffi . ultirs, l  
would ask ».ys»-If what would Dr- Small, M*&#x27;­  
Wyhe. Peyton Randolph do in this filiation  
What c-utse ini’ will insure me their ap­  
probation ? I ain rertai&#x27;i that thia mode or de­  
ciding on my conduct, &#x27;ended more to its coi­  
rrc n ss titan any reasoning powers I possess­  
ed K-owing the eVen and dignified iine they  
pu-sued, I could never doub- lor a moment  
which of two course* wnuld be in chsracter lor  
th-m. Whereas seeking the same object  
through a P&#x27;ocess »f moral reasoning, and  
wit - &#x27;he jaundiced eye &lt;-f voulh. 1 should ol&#x27;en  
ha-e e’ced. From &#x27;he rirrums a &#x27;Ces -&gt;f my po  
si i.»n. I was of en throw * nto the society of  
lio-&#x27;e racers, raid pi.«y* rs, fx hunters, &gt;cieu­

„ ho-s jock* y ? a f« x buntei ? an oratoi ? &lt;r  
a - hon*s advocate of n.y country’s lights?—  
Be assuied my dear Jeff r-&gt;on, &#x27;ha. these little  
ie «*rns into ourselves, &quot;&#x27;is sell caechiving hab­  
it, is not trifli g, nor us. I s , but led* to the  
| prudent select! *n and steady pursuit of what is  
ii«h&#x27; . . .  
i I nave meniioneu good humor as one of the  
pres-rvaiives of our peace and tranquility. It  
j among the m**s&#x27; effectual, and i:s effect is  
so well Imitated and aided, artificially, by po­  
lt:e» ess, that ’.h&#x27;&lt; also becomes an acquisition  
of first tae al&#x27;te. In truth, polite-ess n ar  
| nficiai good hum r, it to»ers*he natural want  
of it, and ends by rendering habi ual a substi •  
tute nearly equivalent to the real^vii toe. It is  
j the practice of saciifiong to ihow whom we  
me. t in soci -y, all the li ile conveniences *nd  
(irwfo-*&quot;r *■ * njf*h fflllfW fi^S C-&#x27;h  
side ration;-it is •!»•’ giving a pleasing and  
Abiding turn to our expressions, which will  
conciliate other-, and make them pleased win*  
u- as well as themselves. How cheap a price  
for the goi-d will of another! When *hi&gt;. is in  
return tor a rude thing 6aid l&gt;v ano&#x27; her, it brings  
him to bis senses, it morifi-s and ror-ects  
him in the most salutary vvay, and places him  
at the feet of your good na ure, in he eyes&lt;f  
the company. But in stating prud*-niial rules  
for our government in s -riels, I must no&#x27; omit  
the important on*, of never entering into dis­  
pn&#x27;e or argument wi h am-t&#x27;iei. I n-ver yn  
saw an instance of on*- or two dispu&#x27;ants con­  
vincing the other by argument I have seen  
many, of lum gening warm, becoming rude,  
and sbooting one another Convicion is the  
eft&#x27; t of «»ur own dispassiona&#x27;e reasoning,  
either in solitude, or weighing within our  
selves, dispassionately, what we hea&#x27; from oth­  
ers, standing unc- inmu ed in argument our­  
selves. It was one *&gt;f he mles, w&#x27; ich, ah &gt;ve  
.ill others, made Doctor Franklin -he uvjsi  
amiab&#x27;e o* mm in sncie.v, 1 • ever ovonira­  
di-t aoy body.’ Ifht was urged to announce  
an opinion, he did i&gt; raihri by asking ques­  
tio s, as if for informa ion, or b&gt; suggesting  
doub&#x27;s. When I hear another express an  
opinion whi h is not mine, 1 say to myself, he  
has a *igUt to his • pinion, a- I io mine; why  
should ! question ii ? His error does me no  
  
injury, ati(J snail i become a Don Q.nxoite, to  
brng all ni^n by force of argument to one  
opinion ? If a fact be misstated, it is probable  
he is gratified by a belief of it, ami I have no  
right to deprive him of the gratification. Jf,  
he wa&#x27; ts information, he will ask it, and then  
I will give it in measured terms; but if he  
still believes his own story, and sh.wsa de­  
site to dispu e the fan wi h me, 1 hear him  
a.&lt;d say nothing. It i, his affair, not min., if  
he pirfers error I here aie two classes of dis­  
putant- most &#x27;requ. n ly to be met w;tb among  
us. Tlie firs&#x27; i\ of young studen *, just entered  
the threshold «.f science, with a fit hi view of its  
outlines, not y»*t filled up with the details and !  
modifications which a further progress would  
bring to their know! dge. The other consists  
of the ill-.empered and rude men in society,  
who have taken up a passi &gt;n for politic*  
(Good humor «nd politeness never introduce  
inti, m.xrd society, a ques ion on which they  
foresee there will he a .difference of opinion.)  
From both of those classes of ditou a«it§ mv  
dear Jefferson, keep aloof as you would flora ;  
the infected subjre.a, of yellow fiver or p. sit- j  
lencr. Consider youvself, when wi’h them, at I  
among th- p...»cnts of Bedium needing medi- j  
ral m-&gt;re than moral counsel. Be a iis **ner ■  
•»&gt;lv, keep within yourself, and endeavor to  
fsublisn with yourself the habit ol ailenre, es­  
peeiady &lt;&gt;n politics In the fevered state of our  
coun.ry, no good can ever result ftom any at­  
tempt to set one of inese fiery zealots to  
rights either in fact or priAripl.. i hey are  
ie ermined as to the facts they will believe, (

ay them, therefore, .&lt;s you would bv an angry ,

he road with such «n animal. You will be (  
more &lt; xpostd than others to have th.se ani* ,  
  
the relation in which you aland jylth roe. Full  
of political venom, and willing 10 see m* and  
to hate me as a chief in the antagonist par&#x27;y,  
your presence will be to them \*ha« ih« vomit

ducing ejaculation. Look upon them exactly  
with that eye, and pi&#x27;y thein&#x27; »s object* to  
whom you can administer only occasional ease..  
My character is not within their power. It i%  
in the hands or my fellow citizens at large, and

lour situation nt such a distance from us, nnd  
alone, cannot but give us great anxieties for you. As  
unicli has been secured fur you, by your particular  
position and the acquaintance to u liich you have been  
recommended, as could be i!„no towards shielding  
you trom the dangers which surround you. Bui  
throw non a wide world, among entire strangers, with­  
out a friend or guardian to advise, so young too  
and with so little experience of mankind, your dan­  
gers are great, and still your safety must rest on your­  
self A c.ctcrmmation never to do what is wrong  
prudence and good humor, will go far towards secu­  
ring to you the est * tion of tho work!. When l  
rrcol.ert that at fourteen years of ago, the whole  
and direction of myself entirely, without a relation  
or fnmid qualffied to advise or guide me, and recollect  
Jit; various sorts of bad cop* my with which I asso­  
ciated from tune to time, lain astonished I did not  
turn oir wit h some them, and become as worthless to  
sonety as they vyero. I had the good fortune to be­  
come acquainted very early with some character* of  
very high standing, and lo fool the incessant wish  
that I Could ever become what they were. Under  
temptations and difficulties, I would ask inygelf what  
•.yonlil Dr. Small Mr. Wythe,Peyton Randolph,.loin  
..s s. uation. U hat course in it will secure me their  
approbation? I am certain that this mode of deciding on  
my conduct, tended more to its correctness than any  
reasoning powers 1 possessed. Knowing the oven  
and dignified line they pursued, I could never doubt  
ror a moment which of the two courses would he in  
character (or them. Whereas, seeking the same ob­  
jeet through a process of moral reasoning, and with  
t..o jaundiced eye of youth, I should often hare erred.  
!• rom the cii cinwatunco* of my position, I was ofutj  
thrown into the society of horse-racers, fox hunters  
scientific and professional men, and dignified men’  
and many a tune have I asked myself, in the enthu­  
siastic mom. nt of the death of n fbx, tho victory of..  
Ittvoiite horse, the issue of a question eloquently ar­  
gued at the bar, or in the great council of the nation,  
well which of these kinds of renutation should I me­  
rer. i hat of n horse-jockey? a fox-hunter? an ora­  
tor. or an honest advocate uf my country&#x27;s rights?  
Be assured my ..ear Jefferson, that these little returns  
into ourselves, this self-catrchising hahit, is not tri­  
lling, imr useless, but leads to tho prudent selection  
and steady pursuit of what is right­  
I have mentioned good Lumor as one of the pre­  
servatives of our peace and tranquility. It is amou *  
the ni?!-t effectual, and its effl.ct m so well imitated  
and aided, urtifieially. by politmrtss, that this nlso be­  
comes an acquisition of first rate value. In truth po­  
liteness is artificial good humor, i* covers the natural  
vvantot it, nnd ends by rendering Inbitual nsubstitute  
nearly equivalent to the real virtue. It is the practice  
of sacrificing to those whom we meet in society all  
t;ie little cmiveiiii neesand preferences which will ^ra­  
tify them, and deprive us of nothing worth a moment’s  
consideration; it is the giving a pleasing and flutterin&#x27;*­  
turn to our expressions, which will conciliate others&quot;  
and make them pleased with us as well as thainsclvc*&#x27;  
How cheap a price fi.f the good will of another!—  
U lieu this is in return for a rude thing said bv an­  
other, it brings him t«» hi* senses, it mortifies&#x27; and  
corrects bun in the most salutary way, and places him  
a* the feet of yo-jr good nature, in the eyes of the  
cunptuiy. But in Ftnting prudential rules fur orr  
government ;,i society, I must nut omit the important  
one. of never entering into dispute or argument with  
another. I never yet saw an ins&#x27;a nee of une of two  
disputants convincing the other bv argument. I have  
seen many of them getting warm, becoming rude*  
and shooting one another. Conviction is the effect  
o, our dispassionate reasoning, cither in politude, or  
weighing within ourselves, dispassionately, what wo  
hear f-om Others, standing uncommitted in argument  
onrs&#x27;Nves. It was one of the rgles, which, above all  
others, made Doctor Franklin the most amiable of  
ni&#x27;Mi t:i society, ‘never to contradict any body.’ Jf  
ho was urged to announce . n opinion, he did it ra­  
ther by asking questions, as if for information, or by  
suggesting doubts. When I hear another express an  
opinion winch is not mine, I say to myself, he has a  
right to his opinion, as I to mine; why should I ques­  
tion it. II;* error docs me no injury, nml shall I bc­  
rnme a Don Quixote, to bring nil’ mon by force uf  
argument to one opinion? If n fact be mistated.it  
i* pr&lt;fliable lie is gratified hy a belief of it, and I hav 1  
-no right to deprive him of the gratification. If ho  
wants iulnrinafinn, he will ask it, said then 1 will c v»  
it in men.-iir. d terms; but if he still believes Ins 7,w n  
story, and shows a sesire to dispute the fact with me.  
  
. ncnr Illinium say nothing. If is his n Hair, not  
mine, n he prefers error. There nre t wo clnsses of  
iiisptifnnf s most frequently to l»n met w *»h among u&lt;?.  
Hie first is of young student-, just entered the thrash,

fooid humor nnd politeness never mtrodncp into mix*  
• d s&lt; ii i v a qin-stiori on which they foresee there will  
be n difference of opinion. From both of those  
classes of disputants, my d&quot;nr J, Heraon, keep nloof  
as yoti would from the infected subjects of yellow

mmliral more than timrnl counsel. Me a listener only*  
keep within yutmelf. and cudenvor to establish with

is among the most effectual, anti its elf-ct is

tificial good humor, it rovers the natural waul  
&quot;fit. and ends hv rrudeiiug Itahitual a substi-|  
lute nearly equivalent to the real value. It is  
the practise of sari ificing to those whom we |  
meet in society, all the lit le inconveniences &#x27;  
ami preferences which will giatify them, and  
deprive us of nothing worth a moment&#x27;s con­  
sideration. it is the giving a pleasing and (I it- J  
leriog turn to out eiprrssious, which will con- 1  
ciliate others, and make them pleased with us I  
as well as themselves. How cheap a price for  
the good w ill of another ! When this is to  
return for a rude thirg said by another, It  
brings bim to hi- senses, it mortifies and enr­  
reels hint in the most salutary way. and pla­  
cet biin at the feet of your good nature, in the  
eves of the company Butin stating pruden­  
tial rules for our government in society, I must  
nol omit the important title, never entering in­  
to dispute or argument with another. | never  
yet saw- an instant of one or two dispulan&#x27;s  
convincing the other by argument. I have seen  
many of tlmin getting warm, becoming rude,  
and shooting one another. Conviction is the  
effect of our own dispassionate reasoning, ei­  
ther in solitude, or weighing within ourselves,  
dispassionately, what we hear fioin oihms,’  
standing nncnminiiied in argument ourselves.  
It wav one of the titles, which, above all othei s  
made Dr. Franklin the most amiable of men  
in society, &#x27; never to contradict any body.’ If  
he was utged to announce tin opinion, he did 1  
it lather by asking questions, as if for inform,!-1  
lion, or by suggesting doubts. W hen I Inm ,  
another espress an opinion which is nol mine, j  
I say tj myself, he hits a right to Ins opinion j  
as I to mine ; why should I question it ? His  
error does me no injury, and shall I become  
a Don Qutsotte, to btiug all men hv lorce of  
atguaenl to one opinion? |f a fact he mis­  
stated, it is probable ke i, gratified bv a belief  
of it, and I base no righl to deprive him of the  
gratification. If lie wants information, he wtil  
ask it. and then J will give it in measured terms  
but if he still believes lit- ow n story, and shews  
e desire to dipole the fact with me, I hear him  
and suy nothing. It is hi* affair, nut mine if  
he prefers error. There are two classes ofdis­  
I utuuts most frequently to be met with among

who have lnUen up a pa.siou for politics,  
(tiood humor and pnlilene** never intr &quot;lure

foresee there wilt he a difference of opinion )  
From both of thote classes of dmpul &lt;nt* my  
dear Jefl-rson, keep atoolasyou would from &#x27;  
the infected subjects, of yellow fever or petti

Vnnr Eifuntinn at snrli a ilistance from US. and  
  
alone, &quot;cannot but give us all great anxieties for  
. 1, ii -  
  
Vou. &#x27;As mucli nas been securea ior you, y  
Vnnr n.jr.irnlar nositiou and the acquaintance to  
  
1 vv. B .r w. ft  
which vou have been recommended, as could be  
. &quot; . . . . t i  
  
done towards studding you lrom tne dangers  
which surround &#x27;you. But thrown on a wide  
w orld, among entire strangers, without a friend  
Or guardian to advise, so young too, and with so  
little experience of jfr.nkind, your dangers are  
i eat, and still your salety must rest on yourself.  
,A determination never to do what is wrong, pru­  
dence and good humour, will go far towards se­  
curing to you the estimation of the world. When  
I recollect that at fourteen years of age, the  
whole care au&#x27;d direction of myself was thrown  
on myself entirely, without a relation or friend  
Qualified to advise me, and recollect the various  
sorts of bad company with which I associated  
iVoai time to time, I am astonished I did not turn  
off with some of them, and become as worth­  
lass to society as they were. I had the good for­  
tane to become acquainted very early with some  
.characters of high standing, and to feel the in­  
cessant wish that I could ever become what they  
were. Under temptations and difficulties, I  
would ask myself what would Dr. Small, Mr.  
Wythe, Peyton llandolph, do in this situation.  
What course in it will insure me their approba­  
tion! I am certain that this mode of deciding  
On my conduct, tended mote to its correctness  
than any reasoning powers I possessed. Know­  
ing the even and dignified line they pursued, I  
could never doubt for a moment which of two  
courses would be in character for them. Where­  
as, seeking the same object through a process of  
n.oral reasoning, and with the jaundiced eye of  
youth, I should often have erred. From the  
&quot;circumstances of my position, I was often thrown  
&#x27;into the society of horse racers, card players, fox  
hunters scientific and professional men, and dig­  
nified men, and many a time have I asked my­  
etlf In tlip enthusiastic moment of the death of a  
  
Vox. the victory of a favourite horse, the issue of  
  
a (luestion eloquently argued at tne Dar, or in tne  
orcat council of the nation, well, which of these  
Rinds of reputation should I prefer. That, of a  
horse jockey t a fox hunter? an orator? or an  
Jiunest advocate of my country&#x27;s rights? Be as­  
sured, my dear Jefferson, that these little returns  
into ourselves, this self-catechising habit, is not  
trilling, nor useless, but leads to the prudent se­  
lection and steady pursuit of what is right.  
&#x27;7 Ikivc trtr-ntioned good humour as one of the  
preservatives of our peace and tranquillity. It is  
among the most effectual, and its effect is so well  
imitated and aided, artificially, by politeness, that  
this also becomes an acquisition of first rate va­  
lue. In truth, politeness is artificial good hu­  
mour, it covers the natural want of it, and ends  
by rendering habitual a substitute ncaily equiva­  
lent to the real virtue. It is the practice of sa­  
crificing to those whom we meet in society all  
the little conveniences and preferences which will  
oratifv them, and deprive us of nothing worth a  
iii.iiupqt&#x27;s consideration ; it is the giving a plea­  
mu &#x27; ami fl ittering turn to our expressions, which  
Mi&#x27;.l conciliate others, and make them pleased  
with us as well ns themselves. How cheap a  
price lor tha eocd will of another! When this is  
iu return for&quot; a rudo thing said by another, it  
t.iinrs him to his senses, it mortifies and corrects  
iii.il &#x27;in the tnot salutary way, and places him at  
thr- feet of ) our good naMro, in the eyes of the  
Company. But in stating prudential rules for our  
joveiiiin&#x27;:iit in society, I must not omit thi im­  
portant one, of never &#x27;entering into dispute or ar­  
iiuifciit with another. I never yet saw an in­  
iunccof one of two disputants convincing the  
orhn by aigiiment. - I liuve seen many of them  
- rttiii&#x27;T&quot;waiiii, becoming rude, and shooting one  
aher. . Conviction is -the tffect of our own  
uNrjsviViiiafe -reasoning! liitr. jn-fnlitnde, or  
  
weighing within ourselves, dispassionately, what  
we hear from others, standing uncommitted in  
argument&#x27; ourselves. 1 It was one of the rules,  
  
which, above all others, made X)x7 Franklin the  
most amiable &#x27;fcf men in society, never to con­  
tradict any body., -If he was urged to announce  
an opinion, lie did it rather by asking questions,  
s if forjinformation, or by suggesting doubts.-  
  
When 1 hear another express an opinion which  
is not mine, I say to myself, he has a right to his  
opinion, as I to mine ; why should I question it.  
His error does me no injury, and shall I become  
  
aDonQuixotte, to bring all men by force of ar  
  
gument to one opinion? If a fact , be misstated,  
  
it is probable he is gratified by a bene! ot it, and  
  
I have no right to deprive him of tbe gratifica­  
tion. 1 If he wants information, he will ask it,  
  
and then I will give it in measured terms ; but if  
  
he still believes his own story, and shews a desire  
to dispute tbe fact with me, I hear him and say  
  
nothing. . It is his affair, not mine, i he prefers  
  
error. There are two classes of disputants most  
  
frequently to be met with among us. The first  
is of young students, just entered the threshhold  
of science, with a first view of its outlines,&#x27; not  
  
yet filled up with the details and modifications  
which a further progress would bring to their  
  
knowledge. . I he other consists oi the ill-tern  
  
pered and rude men in society, who have taken  
up a passion for politics.&#x27; (Good humour and  
  
politeness never introduce into mixed society, a  
question on which &quot;they foresee there will be a  
difference of! opinion.) From both of those  
classes of disputants, my dear Jefferson, keep  
  
aloof as you would from the infected subjects of  
  
yellow fever or pestilence. Consider yoursell,  
  
when with them, as among the patients of Bed  
  
lam, needing: medical more than moral counsel.  
  
Be a listener only, keep within yourself, and en  
  
deavour to establish with youriclf the habit ol si  
  
lence, especially on politics. In the fevered  
  
state of our country, no &quot;good can ever result  
  
from anv attempt to set one of these fiery zea  
  
lots to rights either in fact or principle. They  
  
are determined as to the facts they will believe,  
  
and the opinions on which they will act. tet by  
them, therefore, as you would by an angry bull;  
it is&#x27;notfor a man of sense to dispute the road  
  
with such an animal. You will be more exposed  
  
than others to have these animals shaking their  
hornsat you, because of the relation in which you  
  
stand with me. ; Full of political venom, and wil  
  
ling to see me and to hate me as a chief in the  
  
antagonist party, your presence will be to them  
  
what the vomit grass is tO the sick dog, a nostrum  
  
for producing ejaculation. Look upon them ex  
  
actlv with that eve. and Ditv them as obiects to  
  
whom you can administer only occasional ease,  
  
My character is not within their, power. It is  
in the hands of my fellow citizens at large, and  
  
will be consigned to honour or mtamy by the ver  
diet of the republican mass of our country, ac  
  
cording to what themselves will have seen, not  
  
what their enemies and mine shall have said.  
Never, therefore, consider these puppies in po  
litics as requiring any notice from you, and al  
  
ways shew that you are not afraid to leave my  
  
character to the umpirage ot public opinion.  
  
Look steadily to the pursuits which have carried  
  
you to Philadelphia ; be very select in the so  
  
ciety you attach yourself to; avoid taverns,  
  
drinkers, smokers, idlers, and dissipated persons  
generally for it is with such thnt broils and con  
  
tentions arise ; and you will tind your path more  
  
easy and tranquil. The limits of my paper warn  
  
me it is time for me to close, with mv anection  
ate adieu. . - TH: JEFFERSON.

..  
Your situation at such a distance from us,  
and alone, cannot but give us all great anxi­  
eties for you. As much has been secured for  
you, by your particular position and the ac­  
quaintance to which you have been recom­  
mended, as could be done towards shielding  
you from the dangers which surround you!  
But thrown on a wide world, among entire  
strangers, without a friend or guardian to ad­  
vise, so young too, and with so little experience  
of mankind, your dangers are great, and still  
your safety must rest on yourself. A determin­  
ation never to do what is wrong, prudence and  
good humour, will go far towards securing to  
you the estimation of the world. When 1 re­  
collect that at fourteen years of age, the whole  
care and direction of myself was thrown on  
myself entirely, without a relation or friend  
qualified to advise or guide me, and recollect  
the various sorts of bad company with which  
I associated from time to time, I am astonished  
I did not turn5 off with some of them, and be­  
come as worthless to society as they were. I  
had the good fortune to become acquainted  
very early with somb characters of very hMi  
standing, and to feel the incessant wish that I  
could ever become what thev wnrt TTnrio..  
  
&#x27;temptations and difficulties,! would ask myself S  
  
..uum omuii, iur. vvyine, x eyton  
Randolph, do in this situation ? What course  
in it will insure me their approbation ? I am  
certain that this mode of deciding on my con­  
duct, tended more to its correctness than any  
reasoning powers I possessed. Knowing the  
even and dignified linn th  
  
never doubt for a moment which of two cour-1  
  
ses would be in character for them. Whereas, f  
seeking the same object through a process of;  
moral reasoning, and with the jaundiced eye I  
  
ot youth, I should often have erred. I rom the  
circumstances of my position, I was often  
thrown into the society of horse racers, card  
players, fox hunters, scientific and professional  
men, and dignified men, and many a time have  
I asked myself, in the enthusiastic moment of  
the death of a fox, the victory of a favorite  
horse, the issue of a question eloquently argued  
at the bar, or in the great council of the nation,  
well, which of these kinds of reputation should  
I prefer ? That of a horse Jockey ! a fox hunt­  
er ? an orator ? or an honest advocate of my  
country&#x27;s rights ? Be assured my dear Jeffer­  
son, that these little returns into ourselves, this  
self catechising habit, is not trifling, nor useless,  
but lead to the prudent selection and steady  
pursuit of what is right.  
I have mentioned good humor as one of the  
preservatives of our peace and tranquility. It  
is among the most effectual, and its effect is  
so well imitated and aided, artificially, by po­  
liteness, that this also becomes an acquisition  
of first rate value. Tn truth, politeness is arti­  
ficial good humour, it covers the natural want  
of it, and ends by rendering habitual a substi­  
tute nearly equivalent to the real virtue. It is  
the practice of sacrificing to those whom we  
meet in society all the little conveniences and  
preference, which will gratify them, and de­  
prive us of nothing worth a moment&#x27;s consid­  
eration ; it is the giving a pleasing and flatter­  
ing turn to our expressions, which will concili­  
ate others, and make them pleased with us as  
well as themselves. How cheap a price for  
the good will of another ! When this is in re­  
turn for a rude thing said by another, it brings  
him to his senses, it mortifies and corrects him  
in the most salutary way, and places him at  
  
the feet of jour good nature, in the eyes of the J  
  
company. Jiut in stating prudential rules for  
  
our government in society, I must not omit the j  
  
important one, of never entering into dispute  
or argument with another. I never yet saw an  
instance of one of two disputants convincing  
the other by argument. I have seen many of  
them getting warm, becoming rude, and shoot­  
ing one another. Conviction is the effect of  
our own dispassionate reasoning, either in soli­  
tude, or weighing within ourselves, standing  
uncommitted in argument ourselves. It was  
one of the rules, which, above all others, made  
Doctor Franklin the most amiable of men in  
society, 4 never to contradict any body.&#x27; If he  
  
was. urged to announce an opinion, he did it!  
  
rather by asking questions, as if for information,  
or by suggesting doubts. When I hear anoth­  
er express an opinion which is not mine, I sav  
  
to myself, he has a right to his opinion, as I to !  
mine ; why should I question it. His error does I  
  
me no injury, and shall I become a Don Quix-1  
  
ote, to bring all men by force of argument to  
one opinion i If a fact be misstated, it is prob­  
able he is gratified by a belief of it, and I have  
no right to deprive him of the gratification.  
If he wants information, he will ask it, and then  
I will give it in measured terms ; but if he still  
believes his own story, and shews a desire to  
dispute the fact with mo. I hr.nr him anrl Co,r  
  
7 - V &amp; m V O U. V ft  
nothing. It is his affair, not mine, if he prefers 1  
  
error, mere arc two classes ot disputants  
most frequently to be met with anion us.  
The first is of young students, just entered the  
threshold of science, with a first view of its out­  
lines, not vt fillpd li n with t li r I  
  
modifications which a further progress would j  
bring to their knowledge. The other rnni:tc I  
  
w wma Nrf W w V -  
  
of the ill-tempered and rude men in societv,  
who have taken up a passion for politics.-  
(Good humor and politeness never introduce  
into mixed society a question on which thev  
foresee a difference of opinion.)  
From both of those classes of disputants, my  
dear Jefferson, keep aloof as you would from  
the infected subjects of yellow fever or pesti­  
lence. Consider yourself, when with them, as  
among the patients of Bedlam, needing medic­  
al more than moral counsel. Be a listener on­  
ly, keep within yourself, and endeavor to es­  
tablish with yourself the habit of silence, espe­  
cially on politics. In the fevered state of our  
country, no good can ever result from any at­  
tempt to set one of these fiery zealots to rights  
either in fact or principle. They are deter­  
mined as to the facts they will believe, and the  
opinions on which they will act. Get by them  
therefore, as you would by an angry bull ; it is  
not for a man of sense to dispute the road with  
such an animal. You will be more exposed  
than others to have these animals shaking their  
horns at you, because of the relation in which  
you stand with me. Full of political venom,  
and willing to see me and to hate me as a  
chief in the antagonist party, your presence  
will be to them what the vomit grass is to the  
sick dog, a nostrum for producing ejaculation.  
Look upon them exactly with that eye, and  
pity them as objects to whom you can admin­  
ister only occasional Case. My character is  
not within their power. It is in the hands of  
my fellow citizens at large, and will be consign­  
ed to honor or infamy by the verdict of the re­  
publican mass of our country, according to  
what themselves will have seen, not what their  
enemies and mine shall have said. Never,  
therefore, consider these puppies in politics as  
requiring any notice from you, and always  
shew that you are not afraid to leave my char­  
acter to the umpirage of public opinion. Look  
steadily to the pursuits which have carried you  
to Philadelphia ; be very select in the society  
you attach yourself to ; avoid taverns, drinkers,  
smokers, idlers, and dissipated persons gener­  
ally for it is with such that broils and conten­  
tions arise ; and you will find your path more  
easy and tranquil. The limits of my paper  
warn me it is time for me to close, with my af­  
fectionate adieu. TH : JEFFERSON.

in solitude, or weighing within ourselves,  
dispassionately, what we hear from oth­  
ers, standing uncommitted in argument  
ourselves. &#x27;  
  
It was one of the rules, which, above  
all others, made Dr. Franklin the most  
amiable of men in society, ‘never to con­  
tradict any body.” [lf he was urgedto an­  
nounce an opinion, he did it rather by  
asking questions, as if for information,  
ot by suggesting doubts. When I hear  
another express an opinion which is  
not mine, 1 3ay to myself, he has a right  
to his opinion, as I to mine ; why should |  
question it? His error does me no.injury,  
and shall I become a Don Quixotte to bring  
all &#x27;men by force of argument to one  
opinion? [f a fact be misstated, it is  
probable he is gratified by a belief of it,  
and 1 have no right.to deprive him of the  
gratification. If he wants information,  
he will ask it, and then | will give it in.  
measured terms; but if he still believes  
his own story, and shewsa desire to dis­  
pute the fact with me, T hear himn and  
say nothing. Itix his affair, not mine, if  
he prefers error. There are two classes  
  
&#x27; of diaputapnts most frequently to be met‘  
{ with among us. The first, ia of younge  
{ studeats, just ei.rrred the threshold of  
| science, with a first view of its outlines,  
} notyet fiiled ap with the details and mod:  
| Ifications which a further progress would  
| bring to their knowledze. The othep  
. consists of the ill-tempered and rude men  
| in suciety, who have taken up a passich  
| dor politics. (Good humor and polite­  
l ness mever jntroduce into mixed society;  
A question on which they foreses there  
- will be a difference of (;[;iniOX).) From  
both of those classes of disputants, my  
dear Jeflerson, keep loof as you would  
from the infected subjects of yellow fevep  
’or pestilence. Cousider yourself, when  
with them, as among the patients of Bed­  
lam, needing medical more than moral  
counsel. Be a listener only, keep within  
yourself, and endeavor to establish with  
yourself the habit of siledce, especially  
on politics. In the fevered state of our  
couniry, no good can ever resnit from any  
attempt to set one of these fiery zealots  
to rights either in fact or principle. They  
} are determined as to the facts they wiil  
| belicve,and the opinions on which they  
will act. Get by them, therefore, as you  
! wouid by an angry bull; it is not for a  
of man of sense to di:pute the road with  
such an animal. You will be more expos­  
ed than othors to have these animals shake  
ing their horns at you, becanse of the  
relation in which you stand with me.  
| Full of political venein and willing to  
see me and to hate me as a chief in the  
antagonist party, your presence will be  
to them what the vomit grass is to the i  
sick dog, a nostrum for prodacing ejacn- &#x27;  
lation Look upon them exactly with  
that eye, and pity them as objects to whom  
vou can administer only occasional ease,  
My character is not within their power.  
{t is iti the hands of my feilow.citizens -  
Cat large, and will be consigned to hnnqr  
~or infamy by the verdict of the republi­  
can mass of our country, according to  
- what themselves will have seen, not what  
| their enemies and mine shall have said.—=  
} Never, therefore,consider, these puppies  
in politics as requiring any notice from  
| vou, and always show that you dre not  
alraid to leave my character to the umpi­  
rage of public apinion. Look steadily  
to the pursuits wirich have carried yon  
to hiladeipbia; be very select in the  
- souiety you aittach yourself to avoid  
taverns,drinkers,smokers, idlers,and dissi- &quot;  
pated persons generally,for it is with such  
that broils and contention sarise ; and you  
will find your path more easy and tran­  
&#x27; quil. The limits of my paper warn me  
it is time for me to clese, with my affec­  
* tionate adieu. TH. JEFFERSON.

1. In stating prudential rules for our&lt; govorn.   
mont in society, I must not omit the Important   
one of never entering into argument with anothor.   
  
2. I never saw an instance of one or two die.   
putants convincing the other by argument. I   
have seen many of thorn getting warm, become   
rude, and shooting one another.   
3. Convincing is the offeot of our own dispas.   
sionato reasoning, either in solitude or weighing   
within ourselves, dispassionately what we hear   
from others, standing uncommitted in argument   
ourselves.   
  
4. It was one all) rules which abovo all others   
made Dr. Franklin the most amiable of mon in   
society, &quot;never to contradict any body.&quot; If he   
was urged to announce an opinion, ho did It rather   
by asking questions, as&#x27;for Information, or by sug.   
gaging doubts.   
  
5. When I hoar another express an opinion   
whiCh is not mine, I say to myself; he has a right   
to his opinion, as i to mine; why should I (loca­  
tion it? His error dues me no injury, and shall I   
become a Dnn Quixotte,to bring all men by force   
ofargument to an opinion?   
6. It a fact be mis-stated, it is probable he is   
gratified by a belief of it. and I have no right   
to deprive him of the gratification.   
7. If he wantu information, he will ask it, and   
then I will give it in measured terms.   
8. It he still believes his own story, and shows   
a desire to dispute the fact with me, I hear him,   
and say nothing. It is his affair, not mine, if ho   
prefers an error.   
  
9. There are two classes of disputants most fre.   
quently to be .net with among. us. Tho first is of   
young students just entered the threshold of sci­  
ence; with first views of its outlines,not yet filled   
up with the details and modifications which a fur­  
ther p:ogross would bring to their knowledge.   
10. Tho other consists of the ill tempered and   
rude men in society,who have taken up a passion   
for politics.   
11. Good humor and politeness never introduce   
into mixed society a question on which they fore­  
see there will be a difference of opinion.
