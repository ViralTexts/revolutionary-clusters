Sir Monticello May 24. 12   
Your letter of Mar. 14. lingered much on the road &amp; a long journey, before I could answer it, has delayed it’s acknolegement till now. I am sorry your enterprise for establishing a factory on the Columbia river, and a commerce thro’ the line of that river and the Missouri, should meet with the difficulties stated in your letter.

I considered as a great public acquisition the commencement of a settlement on that point of the Western coast of America, &amp; looked forward with gratification to the time when it’s descendants should have spread themselves thro’ the whole length of that coast, covering it with a free and independant Americans, unconnected with us but by the ties of blood &amp; interest, and enjoying like us the rights of self-government. I hope the obstacles you state are not unsurmountable; that they will not endanger, or even delay the accomplishment of so great a public purpose. in the present state
