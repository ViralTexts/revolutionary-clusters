G.R.” On which Message the House of Commons did the next Day resolve, “That a Sum not exceeding £200,000 be granted to his Majesty on Account, to enable his Majesty to give a proper Compensation to the respective Provinces in North America, for the Expence incurred by them, in the Levying, Cloathing and Pay of the Troops rais’d by the same according as the active Vigor and strenuous Efforts of the respec[tive] Provinces shall be thought by his [Majesty] to merit.” The same Message [followed] by the same Resolve was repeated [torn; each year?] during the War; by which it appears [that] these “his Majesty’s faithful Subjects” exerted themselves with unremi

xtravagancies this Situation and these Apprehensions drove them into.  
But why should it be thought strange that the Governing People here are usually prejudic’d against the Colonies? Much has been said of a virtual Representation, which the Colonies are suppos’d to have here. Of that I understand nothing. But I know what kind of actual Representation is continually made of them, by those from whom Ministers chiefly have their Information. Governors and other Officers of the Crown, even the little Officers of the Revenue sent from hence, have all at times some Account to give of their own loyal and faithful Conduct, with which they mix some contrary Character of the People that tends to place that Conduct in a more advantageous Light. Every good thing done there in the Assemblies, for promoting his Majesty’s Service, was obtained by the Governor’s Influence; he propos’d; he urg’d strongly; he manag’d Parties; there was great Opposition; the Assembly were refractory, and disaffected; but his Zeal and Dexterity overcame all Difficulties. And if thro’ his own Imprudence, or real Want of Capacity, any thing goes wrong: he is never in fault; the Assembly and the People are to bear all the Blame; they are factious, they are turbulent, disloyal, impatient of Government, or, what is the same thing, disrespectful to his Majesty’s Representative. The Custom House Officer represents the People as all inclin’d to Smuggling, Dutch and French Goods (by his Account) swarm in the Country, nothing else would be us’d if it were not for his extream Vigilance; which, indeed, as it takes up all his Time, he hopes will be considered in the Allowance of a larger Salary. Even the Missionary Clergy, to whom all Credit is due, cannot forbear acquainting the Bishops, and their other Superiors, here from whom they receive their Stipends, that they are very [dili]gent in their respective Missions, but that they meet with great difficulties from the adverse disposition of the people: Quakers oppose them in one place, Presbyterians in another: this country swarms with thwarting hereticks; t’other with malevolent sectaries: Infidelity gains ground here, Popery is countenanced there. Their unwearied endeavours, which are never wanting, scarce suffice to prevent the colonists being overwhelmed with vice, irreligion, ignorance, and error! Then the Military Officer, who has served in the colonies, represents them as abounding in wealth; the profuse tables they used to spread for him in their hospitable entertainments convinced him of it; for these he saw daily when he din’d from house to house, and therefore he had reason to imagine it was their common way of living; (though in truth that was extreamly different and much more suitable to their circumstances.) But opulent as he supposes them, they must, in his opinion, be the meanest of mortals to grudge the payment of a trifling tax, especially as it is to maintain soldiers. Thus represented, how can it be otherwise, but that the governing people in Britain should conceive the most unfavourable idea of Americans, as unworthy the name of Englishmen, and fit only to be snubb’d, curb’d, shackled and plundered.

the river, opposite this city ; and on monday  
and tuefday two more were found at the up­  
per end of Kinfington —They are supposed  
to have been drowned some time, but it is  
not known who they were.  
N EW:&gt;-Y OR K, May 35.  
Extra&amp;t of a Letter from London, April 7, 1767.  
g U C H has been lately said of a virtual  
M representation, which the colonies are  
supposed to have here, Of that I understand no­  
thing. But [ know what kind of acual repre­  
sentation, or rather misrepresentation, is continu­  
ally made of them, by those from whom ministers  
chicfly have their information. Govergors and  
other officers of the crown, even the little officers  
of the revenue sent from hence, have all at times  
(ome account to give of their own loyal and faith­  
ful conduét, with which they mix some contrary  
chara&amp;ter of the people that tends to place that  
condu@ in a more advantageous light, Every  
good thing done there in the assemblies, for pro­  
moting his Majesty’s service, was obtained by the  
Governor’s - influence :He proposed, he urged  
(trongly, he managed parties ;—there was a great  
oppolition 3 — ————their aflembly were  
refractory and difaffe@ted j————==—- but his  
zeal and dexterity overcome all difficulties. And  
f through his own imprudence, or real want of  
capacity, any thing goes wrong ; he is never in  
fault 3 the aflembly and people are to bear all the  
blame :—they are factious; they are turbulent,  
impatient of government, difrefpectful to his }\Aa­  
jefty’sßeprefentative.~~T heCuftom-houfcOfiicers  
represents the people as all inclined to smuggling.  
Dutch and French goods ( by his account) swarm  
in the country 3 nuthing else would be used if it  
were not for his extream vigilance ; which, in­  
deed, as it takes up all his time, he hopes will be  
considered in the allowance of a larger salary.—  
Even the Missionary Clergy, to-whom all credit  
is due, cdnnot forbear acquainting the Bishops,  
and their other superiors here from whom they  
receive their stipends, that they are indeed very  
diligent in their refpedive missions 3 but that they  
meet with great difficulties from the adverse dif­  
pafition of the people :=—Quakers oppose them in  
one place, Presbyterians in another ;—this coun­  
try {warms with thwarting hereticks ;—the other  
with malevolent fe@aries : — Infidelity gains  
ground here, Popery is countenanced there—  
Their unwearied endeavours, which are never  
‘wanting, fearce fuffice to - prevent the colonists  
  
being overwhelmed with vice, irreligion, ighor  
ance and gentilifm !=—Then the Military Office  
who has served in the colonies, represents them a  
abounding- in wealth ; the profufe tables the  
used to spread for hirm in their hospitable enter  
tainments convinced him of it ; for these he fa  
daily when he din’d from house to house, an  
therefore he had reason to-imagine it was théi  
commen way of living. But, opulent as he sup  
poses them, they must, in his opinion, be th  
meanest of mortals to grudge the payment of  
trifling tax, especially as it is to maiatain soldiers  
Thus REPRESENTED, how can it be otherwifle  
but that the governing people in Britain fhoul  
conceive the most unfavourable iilea of Americans  
as unworthy the name of Englifhimen,and fit onl  
to be {nubb’d, curb’d, shackled and plundered.-
