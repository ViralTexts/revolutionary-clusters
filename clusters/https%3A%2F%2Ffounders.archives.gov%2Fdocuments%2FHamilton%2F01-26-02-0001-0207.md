Sir  
  
Your letter of the 20th. inst. has been this day received. Having Considered it attentively I regret to find in it nothing of that sincerity and delicacy which you profess to Value.  
  
Political opposition can never absolve Gentlemen from the necessity of a rigid adherence to the laws of honor and the rules of decorum: I neither claim such priviledge nor indulge it in others.  
The Common sense of Mankind affixes to the epithet adopted by Dr Cooper the idea of dishonor: it has been publicly applied to me under the Sanction of your name. The question is not whether he has understood the meaning of the word or has used it according to Syntax and with grammatical accuracy, but whether you have authorised this application either directly or by uttering expressions or opinions derogatory to my honor. The time “when” is in your own knowledge, but no way material to me, as the calumny has now first been disclosed so as to become the Subject of my Notice, and as the effect is present and palpable.  
Your letter has furnished me with new reasons for requiring a definite reply.

Sir—Your letter of the 20th inst. has  
been this day received. Having consi­  
dered it attentively I regret to find in it  
nothing of that sincerity and delicacy  
which you profess to value.  
Political opposition can never absolve  
gentlemen from the necessity of a rigid  
adherance to to the laws of honor and  
the rules of decorum. I ^neither claim  
such privilege nor indulge it in others.  
The common sense of mankind affixes  
to the epithet adopted by Dr. Cooper,  
tiic idea of dishonor. It has been pub­  
licly applied to me under the sanction of  
your name.&#x27; The question is not, whe»  
ther he has understood the meaning of  
the words, or has used it according to  
syntax, and with grammatical accuracy i  
but whether ycu have authorised this ap­  
plication, either directly or by uttering  
expreasions or opinions derogatory to my  
honor. The time * when* is in your own  
knowledge but no way material to me,  
at the calumny has now first been dis­  
closed, ao as to become the subject of  
my notice, and as the effect is present

Your letter has famished me with new
