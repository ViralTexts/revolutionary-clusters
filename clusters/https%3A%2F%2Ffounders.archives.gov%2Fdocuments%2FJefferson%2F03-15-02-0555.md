&quot;DEAR Sia: Your favor of the 3d is received, and al  
ways with welcome. These texts of truths relieve me  
from the floating falsehoods of the publle papers. I confess  
to pout that I uim not sorry for the nonsruttnioitien of the  
Spataich freuty. Our assent to it has proved our desire to  
be on friendly terms with Spain; their dissent, the imb­  
eility and malignity of their Government towards us. We  
have placed them in the wrong in the eyes of the world.  
and that is well; ont to us the prerince of farus will be the  
richest State of our Union, with ant unv erception. Its Sonthe  
ere part wrill male more shour then wre can consrme, and the  
Red Eirer on its Yorth is the most thruriatat conntry on curth.  
Florlda, moreover, is ours; every nation in Europe consld-  
ers it such of right; we need not care for its occupation in  
time of peace, and, in war, the first cannon makes it ours  
without offence to any body. The friendly advisements of  
Rnssia and France, as well as the change of government in  
Spain, now insured, require a further and respectful for­  
bearance. Whlle their request will rebut the plea of pre  
scriptive possession, it will give us a right to their appro­  
bation when taken in the maturity of circutastances. I  
really think, too, that neither the state of our inances, the  
condition of our country, nor the public opin on, urges us  
to preclpitation into war. The traty has had the ralrabse  
a of strvnpthening our fitle to Tarus, bocarese the  
the Floridas tr enchonpe for Thrus taports an acknonled  
meat of our right to it. This province, morcover, the lort­  
das, and possibly Cuba, will loin us on the acknowledg­  
ment of thelr indepeadence--a measure to which their new  
government will probably accede voluntarily. But why  
should I be saving all this to you, of whose mind all the  
clreumstances of this affair have had possession for geurs  
&quot;I shall be hapny to see you here; and were I to live  
to see you here finally, it would be a day of jubllce; but  
our days are all numbered, and mine are not many. God  
bless you and preserve you, muchos amos

DkcrSir: Your favor of the 3d is received, and always p&#x27;e!  
with welcome. These texts of truth rtlieve me from tne &quot;  
floating falsehoods of the public papers. &#x27;or  
1 confess to you 1 am not sorry for the non-ratification of m8&lt;  
ihe Spanish treaty. Our assent to it has proved our desire &#x27; a  
to be on friendly terms with Spain ; their dissent, the imbe- dim  
cilitv and miliznilv of their trovernment towsrds us. We con  
  
have placed them in the wrong in the eyes of the world, and fdCt  
lhat i.-i well. Bat to us the province of Texas will be the richest al&quot;J  
State of our Union, without any exception. Its southern part  
will make more sugar th in we can consume, and the Red river  
on it ; north, is the most luxuriant country on earth. Florida,  
moreover, is ours. Every nation in Europe considers it u  
such of right. We need not care for its occupation in lime yen  
of pence ; and, in war, the first cannon makes it ours with- d,,.  
out offence to anybody. The friendly advisements, too, of co?  
Russia and France, as well as the change of government in &lt;-hi  
Spain, now ensured, require a further and respectful forbear- pCn  
auce. While their request will rebut the plea of preacrip- j m t  
live possession, it will give us a right to their approbation i  
when token in the maturity of circumstances. I really think,  
too, that neither the state of our finances, the condition of ;  
our country, nor the public opinion, urges us to precipitation  
into war. The treaty has had the valuuble effect of strengthening  
our title to Texas, because the cession of the Floridus &#x27;  
in exchange for Texas imports an acknowledgment of our aga  
right to it. This province, moreover, the Floridas, and pos- &quot;or  
sibly Cuba, will join us 011 the acknowledgment of their in- *hl  
dependence, a measure to which their new government will vot  
piobably accede voluntarily. But why should I be saying mtr  
all this to you, of whose mind all the circumstances of this fer  
uffair have had possession for years? ne\
I shall rejoice to see you here ; and were 1 to live to sec nie  
you here finally, it would be a day of jubilee. But our days  
are all numbered, and mine are not many. God bless you  
and preserve you muehoa afios. TH. JEFFERSON. ge
