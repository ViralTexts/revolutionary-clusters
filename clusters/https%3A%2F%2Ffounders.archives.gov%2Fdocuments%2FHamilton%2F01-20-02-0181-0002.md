The period for a new election of a Citizen to administer the Executive Gov of the U States being not very distant and the time actually arrived when theyour thoughts of my fellow Citizens must be employed in designating the Citizen who is to administer the Executive Government of the United States the person who is to be cloathed with that important trust for another term, it may conduce to it appears to me proper, and especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now apprize you of the resolution I have formed to desire decline being considered among of the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made.  
I beg you neverthelessat the same time to be assured that the resolution, which I announce, has not been taken without a strict regard to all the considerations connected with attached toconnected with the relation which |as|a dutiful Citizen|I bearbears to |myhis| Country; and that in withdrawing the tender of my service, which silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for its future interest nor by any deficiency of grateful respect for its past kindness, but by a full conviction that my retreatsuch a step is compatible with both.  
The acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which your unanimous suffrages have twice called me has been a uniform sacrifice of private inclination to the opinion of public duty coinciding withcombined with a deference for your what appeared to be your wishes and to the opinion of public duty. I |had| constantlyconstantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power consistently consistently with motives which I was not at liberty to disregard to return to that retirement from which they those motives had reluctantly drawn me.  
The conflict betwe between those motives and inclination previous to the last election  
The strength of my desire to withdraw previous to the last election had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you—but deliberatemature reflection on the very critical and perplexed posture of our affairs with foreign nations and the unanimous advice of |men of every waypersons| intitled to my confidence obligedimpelled me to abandon the idea.  
I rejoice that that the state of your national Concerns external as well as internal no longer appa renders the pursuit of my inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety, and that thewhatever partiality which any portion of You my fellow citizens may still cherishretain for my services, will not they, will under the existing circumstances of theour Country, will not disapprove themy resolution I have formedto retire.  
The impressions under which I first accepted the arduous trust |of chief Magistrate of the U States| were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust I can only say that I have with pure intentions contributed towa towards the organisation and administration of the Government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable.

ign influence of good laws under a free Government; the ultimate object of all my wishes and |to which I look as| the happy reward I hope of our mutual cares labours and dangers.  
In looking forward to the moment which is to terminate the carreer of my public life, my sensations do not permit me to suppress suspend the deep acknowlegements required by that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me still more for the distinguished and steadfastpersevering confidence it has reposed in me and for the opportunities it has thus afforded meI have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by services at least faithful and persevering—however the inadequateness of my faculties may have ill seconded my have rendered these efforts unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to you my fellow Citizens from these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals that the constancy of your support amidst appearances sometimesfrequently sometimes dubious discouraging vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging and not infrequently want of success in situations in which not infrequently want of success has seconded the suggesti criticisms of malevolence was the essential prop and guarantee of of the efforts and the guarantee of the measures by which they were atchieved. I will not be restrained by personal considerations of personal delicacy from paying you the tribute of declaring Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my retirement and to my grave as a lively incitement to unceasing vows (the only returns I can henceforth make) that Heaven may continue to You the choicest tokens of the beneficence merited by national piety and morality—that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual—that the free constitution, which is the work of your own hands may be sacredly maintained—that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue—that in fine the happiness of the People of these States under the. auspices of liberty may be made complete by so careful a preservation &amp; so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire them the glorious satisfaction of recommending it to the affection the praise—and the adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.  
Here perhaps I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, which cannot expireend but with my life, urges me to offer and the fear that there may exist projects unfriendly to it are in train against which it is very importantmay be necessary you should be carefully guarded, urge me to in taking leave of you to offer to your solemn consideration and frequent review some sentiments the result of mature reflection confirmed by observation &amp; experience which appear to me all import essential to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered with the more freedom as you can only see in them the advice disinterested advice of a parting friend who can have no personal motive to tincture or byass his counsel.

e cannot be too much on their guard against the jealousies which grow out of these misrepresentations. The They tend to render aliens to each other those who ought to be tied together by fraternal affection. The Western Country have lately had a useful lesson on this subject. They have seen in the negotiation by the Executive &amp; in the unanimous ratification of the Treaty with Spain by the Senate the conclusive proof &amp; in the universal satisfaction at that event in all parts of the Country a decisive proof how in unfounded have been the suspicions [that] have been instilled inpropagated among them of a policy hostile in the Atlantic States &amp; in the different statesdepartments of the General Government hostile to their interests in relation to the Mississipian. They have seen too too treaties formed which secure to them every thing that they could desire to confirm their prosperity. Will they not henceforth rely for the preservation of these advantages on that union by which they were procured? Will they not reject those counsellors who would render them alien to their brethren &amp; connect them with Aliens?  
To the duration and efficacy of your Union a Government extending over the whole is indispensable. Without this No alliances however strict between the parts could have the necessary solidity or afford the necessarily be an adequate substitute. These could not fail to be liable to the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have suffered. Sensible of this important truth and with a view to a more intimate Union you have lately established a Constitution of General Government, better calculated than the former one for an intimate union and more adequate to the direction of your common concerns. This Government the offspring of your own choice uninfluenced and unawed, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers uniting energy with safety and containing in itself a provision for its own amendment is well entitled to your confidence and support—Complian Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties dictated by the fundamental maxims of true Liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of Government. But the existing constitution for the time, and until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly binding upon all.

Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of your present happy state, it is not only requisite that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its authority but that you should be upon your guard against the spirit of innovation upon its principles however plausiblespecious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect alterations in the forms of the constitution tending to impair the energy of the system and so to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited remember that time and habit are as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of any other human institutions, that experience is the surest standard by which the real tendency of existing constitutions of government can be tried—that changesfacility in upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinions exposes you to perpetual change from the exssuccessessive and endless variety of hypothesis and opinion—and remember always also that for the efficacious management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours a Government of as much force and strength as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable.

ered and which in different ages and countries have produced the greatest enormities is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which resolution result predispose the minds of men to seek repose &amp; security in the absolute power of a single man. And thesome leader of a prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors turns this disposition to the purpose of an ambitious and criminal self aggrandisement.  
Without looking forward to such an extremity (which however ought not to be out of sight) the ordinary and continual fact mischief of the spirit of party demand the endeavours of moderate make it the interest and the duty of a wise people to discountenance and repress it.  
It serves always to distract the Councils &amp; enfeeble the administration of the Government. It agitates the community with false alarms ill founded jealousies and false alarms and embittering one part of the community against another, &amp; producing occasionaly riot &amp; insurrection. It opens inlets for foreign corruption and influence—which find an easy access through the channels of party passions—and cause the true policy &amp; interestinterests of our own country to be sacrificed to made subservient to the policy and interest of one and another foreign PowerNation; sometimes enslaving the our own Government to the will of a foreign Government.

From the natural tendency of such governments, it is certain there will always be enough of it for every salutary purpose and there being constant danger of excess the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate &amp; correct it. Tis a fire not towhich cannot be quenched but demandsdemanding a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame—lest it should not only warm but consume.

Who can say doubt that in thea long course of time and events the fruits of such a conduct would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to the plan? Can it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity happiness of a nation with its virtue? The experiment is worthy ofrecommended by every sentiment thatwhich ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?  
Toward the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments towardsfor others should be discarded avoided—and that instead of them we should cultivate just and amicable feelings towards all. That nation, which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its attach affection—either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and interest. Antipathy against one nation which never fails to beget a similar sentiment in the other disposes each more readily to violate the rights offer injury and insult to the other—to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling differences arise. Hence frequent quarrelsbroils and bitter and obstinate contests.

As avenues to foreign influence in innume innumerable Ways such attachments are peculiarly alarming to the enlightened independent friend of his CountryPatriot. How many opportunities do they does it afford to intrigue with domestic factions to seduce even to practice with success the arts of success—to misdirect theseduction—to mislead public opinion—to influence or awe the public Councils! Such an attachment of a small or weak towards a great &amp; powerful Nation destines the former to revolve round the latter as its satellite.  
  
Against the Mischiefs of Foreign Influence all are the Jealousy of a free people ought to be constantlycontinually directed exerted. All History &amp; Experience in different ages and nations has proved that foreign influence is one of the most formidablebaneful foes of republican Governt—but theat jealousy of it to be useful must be impartial else it becomes an instrument instead of a defence—of thatthe very influence to be avoided instead of a defenceguard against it.  
An Excessive partiality for one foreign nation &amp; excessive dislike of another, leads to see danger only on one side and serves to viel &amp; second the arts of influence on the other. This is a mo Real Patriots who resist the intrigues of the favorite become suspected &amp; odious. Its tools &amp; dupes usurp the applause &amp; confidence of the people to betray their interests.  
The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign Nations ought to be to have as little political connection with them as possible—so far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled—with circumspection indeed but with perfect good faith. But Here let us stop.  
Europe has a set of primary interests foreign to us which have none or a very remote relation to us. Hence she must be involved in frequent contests the causes of which will be essentially foreign to us. Hence therefore it must necessarily be unwise in us on our part to implicate ourselves by an artificial connectione in the ordinary vicissitudes of European politics—in the combination, &amp; collisions of her friendships or enmities.  
Our detached and distant situation invites us to a different course &amp; enables us to pursue it. If we remain a united people under an efficient Government the period is not distant when we may defy material injury from external annoyance—when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we shall at any time resolve to observe to be duly violated with caution—when menacing more than car when it will be the interest of belligerent nations under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us to be very careful how either forced us to throw our weight into the opposite scale—when we may choose peace or war as our interest guided by justice shall dictate.

Tis our true policy as a general principle to avoid permanent or a close alliance—Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments in a respectably defensive posture we may safely trust to occasional alliances infor extraordinary emergencies. But I mean to submit to you my fellow citizens a general principle of policy which I think ought to govern you as far as you are at present free. In extraordinary exigencies temporary alliances will suffice for the occasion.  
Harmony liberal friendly intercourse and commerce with all nations are recommended by justice humanity &amp; interest. But even our commercial policy should hold an equal hand—neither seeking nor granting particular exclusive favours or preferences—consulting the natural course of things—diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of Commerce but forcing nothing—establishing by treaty with powers so disposed in order to give to Trade a stable course, to trade define the rights of our Merchants and enable the Government to support them—temporaryconventional rules of intercourse the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion of interest will permit but temporary—and liable to be abandonned or varied as time experience &amp; future circumstances may dictate—remembering alway that tis folly to expect a disinterested in one nation to expect disinterested favour in another—that to accept any thing under that character it is to part with a portion of ourits independence—and that weit may frequently find ourselvesitself in the condition of having given an equivalents for nominal favours and of being reproached with ingratitude in the bargain. There can be no greater error in national policy than to desire expect or calculate upon real favours. Tis an illusion that experience must cure, that a just pride ought to discard.  
In offering to you My Countrymen! fellow Citizens these counsels of an old and affectionate friend—counsels suggested by labourious reflection and matured by a various experience—I dare not hope that they will make the strong and lasting impressions I wish—that they will controul the current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course of which has hitherto marked the destiny of all nations. But if I may flatter myself that they may even produce some partial benefits, some occasional good—if the shallthat they sometimes recur to moderate the violence of party spirit—to warn against the evils of foreign intrigue—to guard against the impositions of pretended patriotism—the having offered them must always afford me a precious consolation.

to diſregard, to return to that- retirement, from  
which I had been reluctantly drawn. &#x27;The ſtrength  
of my inclination to do this, previous to- the. laſt  
clection, had even led: to the preparation of an ad-  
dreſs to declare it to you ;. but mature reflection  
on the then perplexed and critical poſture of our  
affairs with foreign nations, and- the unanimous; ad-  
vice of perſons entitled to my conhdence, umpelled  
me to abandon the idea.  
  
I rejoice, that the ſtate of your concerns, external  
as. well as internal, no longer renders the purſuit of  
inclination incompatible with the. ſentiment of du-  
ty, or propriety ; and am perſuaded, whatever par-  
tiality may be retained for my ſervices, that, in the  
preſent circumſtances of our country, you will not  
diſapprove my determination to retire.  
  
The impreſſions, with which I firſt undertook the  
arduous truſt, were explained on the proper Occa-  
hon. In the diſcharge of this truſt, I will only ſay,  
that I have, with good intentions, contributed to-  
wards the organization and adminiſtration of the  
government, the beſt exertions, of which a very tal-  
ible judgment was capable. Not unconſcious, in  
the outſet, of the inferiority of my qualifications,  
experience, in my own eycs, perhaps {till more in  
the eyes of others, has ſtrengthened the motives to  
diſidence of myſelf ; and every day the increaling  
weight of years admoniſhes me more and more,

of the popular character, in governments purely elective,

engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good  
faith. Here let us stop.  
  
Europe has a sef of primary interests, which to us  
have none ora very remote. relation... Hence, she  
must be engaged in frequent controversies, the  
causes of whack ae essentially foreign to our con-  
cerns’ Hence, therefore, it:must be unwise in us to  
implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordina-  
ry vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary com-  
binations, and collisions of her friendships or en-  
mities.  
  
Our detached and distant situation invites and en-  
ables us to pursue a-different course. If we remain  
one people, under an efficient government, the period  
is not far off, when we may defy, material injury  
from external anneyance; when we take such an  
attitude as will cause the neutrality, we may at any  
time resolve upon, to be scrupulously respected ;  
when belligerent nations, under the. impossibility of  
making acquisitions by attacks upon us, will not  
lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we  
may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by  
justice, shall counsel.  
  
Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situa  
tion? Why quit our own, to stand on foreign  
  
|ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with  
  
that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and  
prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rival-  
ship, interest, humor or caprice ?  
  
It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent  
alliances with any portion of the foreign world :

1 bad been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my

As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable  
ways, such attachments are particularly alarming to  
tli e truly enlightened and independent patriot. How  
many opportunities do they afford to tamper with do­  
mestic tactions, to practise the arts of seduction, to  
mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the pub­  
lic councils! Such an attachment of a small or  
  
weak nation toward a great and powerful one, dooms j  
the former to be the satellite of the latter. Against !  
the insidious wiles of&#x27; foreign influence, I conjure j  
von to believe me, fellow-citizens, the jealousy of a  
tree people ought to be constantly awake, since his- j  
tory and experience provo that foreign influence is  
one of the most baneful foes of republican govern- j  
incut. Hut that jealousy, to be useful, must be im- &#x27;  
partial, else it becomes the instrument of the very 1  
influence to be avoided, instead of a defence against 1  
it. Excessive, partiality for one foreign nation, and i

PRESIDENT WASHINGTON,  
TO THE  
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STAGES.  
Friends and Fellow-Citizens :  
The period for a new election of a citizci to ad­  
minister the executive Government of the United  
States being not far distant, and the time itually  
arrived when your thoughts must be empliyed in  
designating the person who is to be clothed ujth that  
important trust, it appears to me proper, csjteeially  
as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of  
the public voice, that I should now apprize you of  
the resolution I have formed, to decline being con­  
sidered among the number of those out of vhom a  
choice is to be made.  
I beg you at the same time to do me the justice  
to be assured that this re solution has not beoa taken  
without a sfrict regard to all the considerations ap­  
pertaining to the relation which binds a dutiul citi­  
zen to his country; and that, in withdraw.ng the  
tender of service which silence in my situatioi might  
imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for  
your future interest j no deficiency of grateful respect  
for your past kindness j but am supported by a full &#x27;  
conviction that4,hc step is compatible with botk 1  
The acceptance of, and continuance hithtrto it, the 1  
office to which your suffrages have twice wiled me, &#x27;  
have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the  
opinion of duty, lyid to a deference for- wha. appear- i  
ed to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it !  
would have been much earlier in my power, con.sis- &#x27;  
tently with motives which I was not at liberty to &lt;  
disregard, to return to that retirement from which I 1  
h:id been reluctantly drawn. The strength &lt;f my &lt;  
inclination to do this, previous to the last eletion, i  
had even led to the preparation of an address o de- &lt;  
clare it to you; but mature reflection on tin then i  
perplexed and critical posture of our affairs .with i  
foreign nations, and the unanimous advice a per- i  
sons entitled to my confidence, impelled ine t&lt; aban- ]  
don the idea. 1  
I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external  
as well as internal, no longer renders the pur.uit of i  
inclination incompatible with the sentiment of c&#x27;uty or 1  
propriety ; and am persuaded, whatever partiality nay be (  
retained for my services, that in the present circumttances &lt;  
of our country you will not disapprove my determ nation  
to retire. 1  
The impressions with which I fir^t undertook iho ar- &lt;  
duous trust, were explained on the proper occasion. In i  
the discharge of this trust I will only si^y, that I have with i  
good intentions contributed towards the organization and *  
administration of the Government the oet^t exertions of i  
which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not uncon- f  
scious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, 1  
experience in my own. eyes, perhaps atilLmum in Jtlu; eyes i  
of others, has strengthened the motives to Uffidenoe of

ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary |  
combinations and collisions of her friendships or  
enmities.—Our detached and distant situation invites  
and enables us to pursue a different course. If we |
