New York June 20. 1804  
Sir  
  
I have maturely reflected on the subject of your letter of the 18th instant; and the more I have reflected the more I have become convinced, that I could not, without manifest impropriety, make the avowal or disavowal which you seem to think necessary.  
The clause pointed out by Mr. Van Ness is in these terms “I could detail to you a still more despicable opinion, which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr.” To endeavour to discover the meaning of this declaration, I was obliged to seek in the antecedent part of the letter, for the opinion to which it referred, as having been already disclosed. I found it in these words “General Hamilton and Judge Kent have declared, in substance, that they looked upon Mr. Burr to be a dangerous man, and one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of Government”. The language of Doctor Cooper plainly implies, that he considered this opinion of you, which he attributes to me, as a despicable one; but he affirms that I have expressed some other still more despicable; without however mentioning to whom, when, or where. ’Tis evident, that the phrase “still more dispicable” admits of infinite shades, from very light to very dark. How am I to judge of the degree intended? Or how shall I annex any precise idea to language so indefinite?  
Between Gentlemen, despicable and more despicable are not worth the pains of a distinction. When therefore you do not interrogate me, as to the opinion which is specifically ascribed to me, I must conclude, that you view it as within the limits, to which the animadversions of political opponents, upon each other, may justifiably extend; and consequently as not warranting the idea of it, which Doctor Cooper appears to entertain. If so, what precise inference could you draw as a guide for your future conduct, were I to acknowlege, that I had expressed an opinion of you, still more despicable, than the one which is particularised? How could you be sure, that even this opinion had exceeded the bounds which you would yourself deem admissible between political opponents?  
But I forbear further comment on the embarrassment to which the requisition you have made naturally leads. The occasion forbids a more ample illustration, though nothing would be more easy than to pursue it.  
Repeating, that I cannot reconcile it with propriety to make the acknowlegement, or denial, you desire—I will add, that I deem it inadmissible, on principle, to consent to be interrogated as to the justness of the inferences, which may be drawn by others, from whatever I may have said of a political opponent in the course of a fifteen years competition. If there were no other objection to it, this is sufficient, that it would tend to expose my sincerity and delicacy to injurious imputations from every person, who may at any time have conceived the import of my expressions differently from what I may then have intended, or may afterwards recollect.  
I stand ready to avow or disavow promptly and explicitly any precise or definite opinion, which I may be charged with having declared of any Gentleman. More than this cannot fitly be expected from me; and especially it cannot reasonably be expected, that I shall enter into an explanation upon a basis so vague as that which you have adopted. I trust, on more reflection, you will see the matter in the same light with me. If not, I can only regret the circumstance, and must abide the consequences.  
The publication of Doctor Cooper was never seen by me ’till after the receipt of your letter.  
I have the honor to be   Sir   Your obed.

New York, Fune 20, 1804.  
SIR,  
  
I have maturely reflected on the subject of  
your letter of the eighteenth inst. and the more  
I have reflected, the mere I have become con-  
vinced that I could not, without manifest im-  
propriety, make the avowal or disavowal which  
you seem to think necessary. The clause pointed  
out by Mr. Van Ness is in these terms, “1 could  
detail to you a stil’ more despicable opinion which  
Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr.” To en-  
deavour to discover the meaning of this declara-  
tion, 1 was obliged to seek in the antecedent  
part of this letter for the opinion to which it  
referred, as having been already disclosed: ]  
found it in these words, “‘General Hamilton and  
Judge Kent have declared, in sudstance, that they  
looked upon Mr. Burr to be a dangerous man, and  
one who ought not to be trusted with the reins of  
government.”  
  
The language of Dr. Cooper plainly implies,  
that Ae considered this opinion of you, which he  
attributes to me, as a despicable one, but he af-  
firms that I have expressed some other, sti//  
more despicable ; without, however, mentioning to  
whom, when, or where. © ’Tis evident that the  
phrase ‘ still more despicable’ admits of infinite  
shades, from very light to very dark. How am  
I to judge of the degree intended ; or how shall  
I annex any precise idea to language so in-  
definite ?  
  
Between gentlemen, despicable and more despi-  
cable are not worth the pains of a distinction ;  
when, therefore, you do not interrogate me, as to  
the opinion, which is specifically ascribed to me, I  
must conclude, that you view it as within the  
limits, to which the animadversioirs of political  
opponents upen each other may justifiably ex-  
tend, and consequently as not warranting the  
idea of it which Dr. Cooper appears to entertain.  
If so, what precise inference could you draw, as  
a guide for your conduct, were I to acknowlege  
that I had expressed an opinion of you still  
more despicable than the one which is particular-  
ized? How could you be sure that even this  
opinion had exceeded the bounds which you  
would yourself deem admissible between puliti-  
cal opponents ?  
  
But | forbear further comment on the embar-  
rassment, to which the requisition you have made  
naturally leads. The occaston forbids a more  
ample illustration though nothing could be more  
easy than to pursue it.  
  
Repeating that I cannot reconcile it with pro-  
priety to make the ackhowledgment or denial  
you desire, I will add that I deein it inadmissible  
on Principle, to consent to be interrogated as to  
ihe justness of the inferences which may be  
drawn by others from whatever I may have said  
of a political opponent in the course of a fifteen  
years competition. If there were no other objection  
to it, this is sufficient, that it would tend to ex-  
pose my sincerity and delicacy to injurious im-  
putations from every person, who may at any  
time have conceived the import of my expressions,  
aeieesntty from what I may then Have intense.  
  
See PALL ee Peg ™ 3 caine’ tg.)  
  
  
  
  
or may alterwards recollect. 1 stand ready to  
avow or disavow, promptly and explicitly, any  
precise or ‘definite opinion, which I may be  
charged with having declared of any gentle-  
man. More than this cannot fitly be expectec  
from me ; and especially it cannot be reasonabl}  
expected that I shall enter into an explanation  
upon a basis so vague as that which you have  
adopted. | trust, on more reflection, you will see  
the matter in the same light with me. If not,  
  
I can only regret the circumstance, and must

New York, June 2oth, 1301.  
Sir,  
T have maturely reflected on the sub­  
ject of your letter of the 18th inst. and  
the more I have reflected, the more f  
have become convinced that I could  
not w ilhout manifest impropriety make  
the avowal or disavowal which t on  
seem to think necessarv. The clause  
pointed out by Mr. Van Ness is in  
these terms, u I could detail to vou a  
»t:Umore despicable opinion which Ha­  
milton has expressed of Mr. Burr.”  
To endeavor to discover the meaning  
of this declaration, 1 was obliged to  
seek in the antecedent part of this let­  
ter for the opinion to which it referred,  
as having been already disclosed: I  
f mnd it in these words, “ General Ha­  
milton and Judge Kent have declared

The language of Dr. Cooper plainly  
implies, that Ac considered this opini­  
on of yon, which he attributes to me,  
as a despicable one, but he affirms that  
1 have expressed some other, still  
more despicable’, without however,  
mentioning to whom, when, or where.  
’Tin evident that the phrase “still  
more despicable” admits of infinite  
shades from verv light to very dark.  
How -mu I to judge of the degree in­  
tended? fir how shall I annex :mv  
precise idea to 1 mguage so indefinite ?  
B etween gr n 11 emen. d- p &#x27;cable a r d

not interrogate me, as to the onininn  
which it specif rally ascribed to nr, 1  
must conclud •, that you view it as  
v ithin lim&quot;ts to which t^*c nuimadver*  
f •c.&#x27;i of political onponen&#x27;s upon each  
* * icr ituv justifiably extend, and ron­

The language of Doctor Cooper

firms, that I have expressed some

But I forbear tartjier comment on&#x27;  
the embarrassment, to which the re­

No. 2—New-York, June 20,1804.  
Sir—I have merely reflected on the  
subject of your letter of the 18th instant,  
«md the more l have reflected, the more  
i have become convinced that I could  
not without manifest impropriety make  
he avowal or disavowal which you think  
accessary. The clause pointed out by­  
Mr. Van Nessts in these terms, ‘ I could  
detail to you a *,ill more despicable opin­  
&lt;&gt;n which Hamilton ha* expressed of Mr.  
ilurr.’ To endeavour to discover the  
..K-auing of thTs declaration, I was oblig­  
ed to seek in the antecedent part of this  
idler for the opinion to which it refer­  
red as having been already disclosed ; 1  
found it in these words, * Gen. Hamilton  
and Judge Kent have declared in substance  
J»at they looked upon Mr. Burr to be a  
iangerous man, and one who ought not  
to be trusted with the reins of govern­  
i meat &#x27; —- • . &#x27; &#x27; .»  
  
r  
1 he language of Dr. Cooper plainly  
| Implies, mat tee considered this opinion  
111 you, which he attributes to me as a  
despicable one, but he affirms that I have  
expressed some other, still more despi­  
cable i without however mentioning, to  
whons When pr where. ’Tis evident  
that the phrase ‘still more despicable’ ad­  
mits of infinite shades from vm light to  
very dark. How am 1 to judge &quot;6f the  
I degree intended? or how shall 1 annex any  
I precise idea to language so indefinite ?  
Between gentlemen, despicable and  
I mare despicable are npt worth the pains  
I of a distinction when therefore \ ou  
ionot interrogate me, as to the opinion  
Fwhich is Specifically ascribed to me, I  
I must conclude that you view it as within  
the limits to which the animadversions  
I cf political opponents upon each other  
I may justifiably extend, and consequently  
Lm not warranting the idea of it which  
I Or. Cooper appears to entertain. If so,  
1 what precise inference could you draw  
as a guide for your conduct, were you  
toacknowledge that I had expressed an  
opinion of you still more despicable than  
the one which is particularised ? How  
covild you he sure that even this opinion  
I had exceeded the bounds which you would  
I \ ourself deem admissible between poUti­  
|cal opponents?  
But I forbear further comment ion the  
| embarrassment, to which the requisite  
1, t? Oh  
  
on yon have made naturally leads. The  
occasion forbids a morAmple illustrati­  
on, though nothing could be more easy  
than to pursue It.  
Repeating that I cannot reconcile it  
with propriety, to acknowledgement,or  
denial, you desire 1 will add that I deem  
it inadmissible on principle, to consent  
to be interrogated as to the justness of the  
inferences which may be drawn by jo*  
thers from whatever I may have said, of  
a political opponent in the course of fif­  
teen years competition. If there were  
no other objection to it this m sufficient,  
that it would tend to expose my sincerity  
to injurious imputations from every per­  
son who may at any time have conceived  
ah* import of my cxpnteaion^. riiftyrvnt­  
ly from what I may then have intended  
or may afterwards recollect. I stand rea­  
dy to avow or disavow promptly and ex­  
plicitly any precise or definite opinion  
which I may be charged with having de­  
clared of any Gentleman. More than  
this cannot fitly be exnected from me,  
and especially it cannot ue reasonably ex­  
pected that I shall enter into an explana­  
tion upon a basis so vague as that which  
you have adopted. I trust on more re­  
flection you will see the matter in the  
same light with me. If not, I can only  
regret the circumstrnce and must abide  
the consequences. .  
The publication of Doctor Cooper was  
never seen by me ’till after the receipt of  
your letter.  
I have the honor to be See.  
A. HAMILTON.  
Col. Burr.

SIRj &#x27; -New-Tori. June 30,-1804.  
  
I have maturely reHeded ou the fubjectof  
  
your letter ot the isthtnil. and the more  
I have reflected the more I have become  
convinced that I could not &quot;without rhanh  
feft impropriety, make the avowal or dis­  
avowal whica you feem to think neceiTa-  
ry. The claufe pointed out by Mf. Van  
  
Nefs U. in tlkie terms,&quot; I could detail to  
ybu a, fiitl more defpicable opinion which  
Hamilton has expreffed of Mr. Burr.&quot;  
  
To endeavour todilcover the meaning of  
this declaration, I was obliged to Peek in  
the . antecedent part of this letter for the  
  
opinion to which &#x27;it referred, as having ;  
been already difclofed : I found it in  
thefe words 11 General Hamilton and  
judge Kent have declared ,ih fubjlance,  
that they looked upon Mr. Burr to be a  
dangerous mt&#x27;n and ont &#x27;whi ought hit ti be  
Uufted with the reins of government. ,  
The languagVbf Doctor Cooper plain- -&#x27;  
&quot;My implies, that he confldered this opinion  
or you,, which he Htftibutes to me, as a  
dtfplcahle one, but he affirms that I have  
exprcfleJ fome other,? mare dtfpkobU)  
without, however, mentioning to whom&#x27;,  
when, or where. &#x27;Tis evident that the  
chute &quot;dill more tlcfpickble&quot; , admits o7  
Infinite ftiades from very light to very  
dark. How am t to ui&#x27;ge of the degree  
Intended? or how (ha I 1 annex any pre­  
c fe idea to language fo indefinite  
Between Gentlemen, defpicable ihd  
Vnorf d fflicahle are not worth the pains of

In&#x27;ertoga&#x27;e mepis to hc opinion which  
isfpecifieal&#x27;y afcribed to me, I mud con­  
clude that you view it as within the li­  
mits to which the animadverfions of poli-  
  
tiV opponents totacb-other may-juflifi--  
  
ab.y extend, and confequerttly at rot  
warranting the idea of it which Doclor  
Cooper appears to entertain. If fo, what  
prrcife inference could you draw, as a  
cuide for your conduct, were I to ac­

one whhhti particularlied I How could  
  
jui be furc tnat even this opinion had

But I farbear further comment on the

You have made naturally leads. The oc

r to be  
Your obedient servant, A. Burr.  
Gen. Hamilton. .  
Which received from Gen. Hamilton the following reply :—  
  
New York, June 20, 1804.  
  
Sir—I have maturely reflected on the subject of your letter of the 18th  
&#x27;inst., and the more I have reflected the more [ have become convinced, that  
| I could not, without manifest impropriety, make the avowal or disavowal  
| which you seem to think necessary. The clause pointed out by Mr. Van  
| Ness is in these terms: ‘I could detail to you a sti// more despicable opin-  
| ion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr.” To endeavor to  
| discover the meaning of this declaration, I was obliged to seek, inthe an-  
tecedent part of this letter, for the opinion to which it referred, as having  
been already disclosed. [ tound it in these words:—** General Hamilton  
and Judge Kent have declared, in substance, that they looked upon Mr.  
Burr to be a dangerous man, and one who ought not tobe trusted with the  
reins of government.”  
  
The language of Dr. Cooper plainly implies, that he considered this opin-  
ion of you, Which he attributes to me, as a despicable one; but he affirms  
that I have expressed some other, more despicable, without, however, men-  
tioning to whom, when, or where. Tis evident that the phrase, “ still |  
more pat, veg admits of infinite shades, from very light to very dark.  
How am I to judge of the degree intended? or how shall I annex any pre-  
  
cise idea to language so indefinite.  
  
Between gentlemen, despicable and more despicabie are not worth the |  
pains of distinction: when, therefore, you do not interrogate me, as to the |  
opinion which is specifically ascribed to me, I must conclude, that you view |  
it as within the limits to which the animadversions of political opponents |  
upon each other may justificably extend, and consequently as not warranting |  
  
the idea of it which Dr. Cooper appears to entertain. If so, what precise |  
inference could you draw, as a guide for your conduct, were I to acknow- |  
ledge that I had expressed an opinion of you stidd more despicadle than the |  
one which is particularized ? Howcould you be sure that even this opin- |  
ion had exceeded the bounds which you would yourself deem admissible |  
between political opponents ? |  
  
But I forbear further comment on the embarrassment, to which the re- |  
quisition you bave made naturally leads. The occasion forbids a more am-  
ple illustration, though nothing could be more easy than to pursue it.  
  
Repeating that I cannotreconcile it with propriety to make the acknow-  
ledgment or denial you desire, I will add that I deem it inadmissible on  
principle, to consent to be interrogated as to the justness of the inferences  
which may be drawn by other from whatever I may have said of a political  
opponent, in the course of fifteen years competition. Ifthere were no other  
objection to it, this is sufficient, that it would tend to expose my sincerity  
and delicacy to injurious imputations from every person who may at any  
time have conceived the import of my expressions, differently from what I  
may then have intended or may afterwards recollect. I stand ready to avow  
or disavow promptly and explicitly any precise or definite opinion which

guns, a word more. These rhymes have been the offspring of incidents con -

referred, as having been already disclosed. I  
found it in these words : &quot; General Hamilton and

evident, that the phrase &quot;still more despica­  
ble,&quot; admits of iufinite shades, from very light  
to very dark. How am I to judge of the de­  
gree intended? or how shall I annex auy pre­  
cise iJea to language so indefinite t  
Between gentlemen, despicable and more  
despicable arc not worth the pains of distinc­  
tion : when, therefore, ou do not interrogate  
me, as to the opinion which is specifically as­  
cribed to me, I must conclude, that you view  
it as within the limits to which the animad­  
versions of political opponents upon each  
other may justifiably extend, und consequent­  
ly as not warranting the idea of it which Dr.  
Cooner annears to entertain. If so, what  
i t  
precise inference could you draw, as a guide  
for your conduct, were 1 to acknowledge that  
I had expressed an opinion ot you still more  
despicable than the oue which is particular  
ized ? How could you be sure that even this  
opinion had exceeded ihe bounds which yoj  
would yourself deem aamissible between po  
litical opponents?  
But I forbear further comment on the em  
barrassmcni, to which the requisition you have  
made naturally leads. i ho occasion forbids  
more ample illustration, though nothing  
could be more easy than to pursue it.  
Repealing that 1 cannot reconcile it with  
propriety to make the acknowledgement or  
dental you desire, I will add that 1 deem in  
admissible on principle, to consent to be in  
terrogated as to the justness of the inferences  
which may be drawu by others from whatever  
I may have said of a political oppoiieut in the  
course of 15 years competition. If there was  
no other objection to it, this is sufficient, that  
it would tend to expose my sincerity and  
delicacy to injurious imputations from every  
person who may at any time have conceived  
the import of my oxpressions, differently from  
what 1 may then have iutended, or may after­  
wards recollect. I staud ready to avow or  
disivow promptly and explicitly any precise  
or definite opinion which I may be charged  
with having declared of any gentleman. More  
than this cannot fitly be expected from me;  
and especially it caunot be reasonably ex­  
pected that I shall enter into an explanation  
upon a basis so yague as that which you have  
adopted. 1 trust, on more reflection, you  
will see the matter in the same light with  
me. If not, I can only regret the circum­  
stance, and must abide the consequences

one of the acutest men that ever  
lived, amidst all these specious ap-  
pearances, failed to find any appear-  
ance of treachery ; and, as he said  
in the course of the correspondence,  
political hostility can never excuse  
insult.  
  
A letter from Dr. Charles D.  
Cooper, 1804, containing the words  
below, found itself in the papers:  
“General Hamilton and Judge  
Kent have declared in substance

despicable opinion which General  
Hamilton has expressed of Mr.  
Burr.”
