Hamilton, had been hitherto silent on the business before the Convention, partly from respect to others whose superior abilities age &amp; experience rendered him unwilling to bring forward ideas dissimilar to theirs, and partly from his delicate situation with respect to his own State, to whose sentiments as expressed by his Colleagues, he could by no means accede. The crisis however which now marked our affairs, was too serious to permit any scruples whatever to prevail over the duty imposed on every man to contribute his efforts for the public safety &amp; happiness. He was obliged therefore to declare himself unfriendly to both plans. He was particularly opposed to that from N. Jersey, being fully convinced, that no amendment of the Confederation, leaving the States in possession of their Sovereignty could possibly answer the purpose. On the other hand he confessed

mportance &amp; self-sufficiency? 3. An habitual attachment of the people. The whole force of this tie is on the side of the State Govt. Its sovereignty is immediately before the eyes of the people: its protection is immediately enjoyed by them. From its hand distributive justice, and all those acts which familiarize &amp; endear Govt. to a people, are dispensed to them. 4. Force by which may be understood a coertion of laws or coertion of arms. Congs. have not the former except in few cases. In particular States, this coercion is nearly sufficient; tho’ he held it in most cases, not entirely so. A certain portion of military force is absolutely necessary in large communities. Masss. is now feeling this necessity &amp; making provision for it. But how can this force be exerted on the States collectively. It is impossible. It amounts to a war between the parties. Foreign powers also will not be idle spectators. They will interpose, the confusion will increase, and a dissolution of the Union will ensue. 5. influence. he did not mean corruption, but a dispensation of those regular honors &amp; emoluments, which produce an attachment to the Govt. Almost all the weight of these is on the side of the States; and must continue so as long as the States continue to exist. All the passions then we see, of avarice, ambition, interest, which govern most individuals, and all public bodies, fall into the current of the States, and do not flow in the stream of the Genl. Govt. The former therefore will generally be an overmatch for the Genl. Govt. and render any confederacy, in its very nature precarious. Theory is in this case fully confirmed by experience. The Amphyctionic Council had it would seem ample powers for general purposes. It had in particular the power of fining and using force agst. delinquent members. What was the consequence. Their decrees were mere signals of war. The Phocian war is a striking example of it. Philip at length taking advantage of their disunion, and insinuating himself into their Councils, made himself master of their fortunes. The German Confederacy affords another lesson. The authority of Charlemagne seemed to be as great as could be necessary. The great feudal chiefs however, exercising their local sovereignties, soon felt the spirit &amp; found the means of, encroachments, which reduced the imperial authority to a nominal sovereignty. The Diet has succeeded, which tho’ aided by a Prince at its head, of great authority independently of his imperial attributes, is a striking illustration of the weakness of Confederated Governments. Other examples instruct us in the same truth. The Swiss cantons have scarce any Union at all, and have been more than once at war with one another.

Otherwise it will be swallowed up by them. It is agst. all the principles of a good Government to vest the requisite powers in such a body as Congs. Two Sovereignties can not co-exist within the same limits. Giving powers to Congs. must eventuate in a bad Govt. or in no Govt. The plan of N. Jersey therefore will not do. What then is to be done? Here he was embarrassed. The extent of the Country to be governed, discouraged him. The expence of a general Govt. was also formidable; unless there were such a diminution of expence on the side of the State Govts. as the case would admit. If they were extinguished, he was persuaded that great œconomy might be obtained by substituting a general Govt. He did not mean however to shock the public opinion by proposing such a measure. On the other hand he saw no other necessity for declining it. They are not necessary for any of the great purposes of commerce, revenue, or agriculture. Subordinate authorities he was aware would be necessary. There must be district tribunals: corporations for local purposes. But cui bono, the vast &amp; expensive apparatu

to the States. The only difficulty of a serious nature which occurred to him, was that of drawing representatives from the extremes to the center of the Community. What inducements can be offered that will suffice? The moderate wages for the 1st. branch would only be a bait to little demagogues. Three dollars or thereabouts he supposed would be the utmost. The Senate he feared from a similar cause, would be filled by certain undertakers who wish for particular offices under the Govt. This view of the subject almost led him to despair that a Republican Govt. could be established over so great an extent. He was sensible at the same time that it would be unwise to propose one of any other form. In his private opinion he had no scruple in declaring, supported as he was by the opinions of so many of the wise &amp; good, that the British Govt. was the best in the world: and that he doubted much whether any thing short of it would do in America. He hoped Gentlemen of different opinions would bear with him in this, and begged them to recollect the change of opinion on this subject which had taken place and was still going on. It was once thought that the power of Congs. was amply sufficient to secure the end of their institution. The error was now seen by every one. The members most tenacious of republicanism, he observed, were as loud as any in declaiming agst. the vices of democracy. This progress of the public mind led him to anticipate the time, when others as well as himself would join in the praise bestowed by Mr. Neckar on the British Constitution, namely, that it is the only Govt. in the world “which unites public strength with individual security.” In every community where industry is encouraged, there will be a division of it into the few &amp; the many. Hence separate interests will arise. There will be debtors &amp; creditors &amp;c. Give all power to the many, they will oppress the few. Give all power to the few, they will oppress the many. Both therefore ought to have power, that each may defend itself agst. the other. To the want of this check we owe our paper money, instalment laws &amp;c. To the proper adjustment of it the British owe the excellence of their Constitution. Their house of Lords is a most noble institution. Having nothing to hope for by a change, and a sufficient interest by means of their property, in being faithful to the national interest, they form a permanent barrier agst. every pernicious innovation, whether attempted on the part of the Crown or of the Commons. No temporary Senate will have the firmness eno’ to answer the purpose. The Senate (of Maryland) which seems to be so much appealed to, has not yet been sufficiently tried. Had the people been unanimous &amp; eager, in the late appeal to them on the subject of a paper emission they would have yielded to the torrent. Their acquiescing in such an appeal is a proof of it. Gentlemen differ in their opinions concerning the necessary checks, from the different estimates they form of the human passions. They suppose seven years a sufficient period to give the senate an adequate firmness, from not duly considering the amazing violence &amp; turbulence of the democratic spirit. When a great object of Govt. is pursued, which seizes the popular passions, they spread like wild fire, and become irresistable. He appealed to the gentlemen from the N. England States whether experience had not there verified the remark. As to the Executive, it seemed to be admitted that no good one could be established on Republican principles. Was not this giving up the merits of the question: for can there be a good Govt. without a good Executive. The English model was the only good one on this subject. The Hereditary interest of the King was so interwoven with that of the Nation, and his personal emoluments so great, that he was placed above the danger of being corrupted from abroad—and at the same time was both sufficiently independent and sufficiently controuled, to answer the purpose of the institution at home. one of the weak sides of Republics was their being liable to foreign influence &amp; corruption.

d by the predominant influence of the former. What is the inference from all these observations? That we ought to go as far in order to attain stability and permanency, as republican principles will admit. Let one branch of the Legislature hold their places for life or at least during good behaviour. Let the Executive also be for life. He appealed to the feelings of the members present whether a term of seven years, would induce the sacrifices of private affairs which an acceptance of public trust would require, so so as to ensure the services of the best Citizens. On this plan we should have in the Senate a permanent will, a weighty interest, which would answer essential purposes. But is this a Republican Govt., it will be asked? Yes if all the Magistrates are appointed, and vacancies are filled, by the people, or a process of election originating with the people. He was sensible that an Executive constituted as he proposed would have in fact but little of the power and independence that might be necessary. On the other plan of appointing him for 7 years, he thought the Executive ought to have but little power. He would be ambitious, with the means of making creatures; and as the object of his ambition wd. be to prolong his power, it is probable that in case of a war, he would avail himself of the emergence, to evade or refuse a degradation from his place. An Executive for life has not this motive for forgetting his fidelity, and will therefore be a safer depository of power. It will be objected probably, that such an Executive will be an elective Monarch, and will give birth to the tumults which characterize that form of Govt. He wd. reply that Monarch is an indefinite term. It marks not either the degree or duration of power. If this Executive Magistrate wd. be a monarch for life—the other propd. by the Report from the Comtte of the whole, wd. be a monarch for seven years. The circumstance of being elective was also applicable to both. It had been

 Having made these observations he would read to the Committee a sketch of a plan which he shd. prefer to either of those under consideration.

up the merits of the question; for can ihere  
be a good Government without a good Exe­  
cutive? The English model was the only  
good one on this subject. The hereditary  
interest of the King was so interwoven  
with that of the nation, and his personal  
emolument so great, that he was placed  
above the danger of being corrupted from  
abroad; and, at the same time, was both suffi­

yond the ideas of most members. But will  
such a plan be adopted out of doors! In  
return, he would ask, will the people adopt  
the other plan? At present, they will adopt  
neither. But he sees the Union dissolving, or  
already dissolved; he sees evils operating in  
the States which must soon cure the people  
of their fondness for democracies; he sees that  
a great progress has been already made, and  
  
is still going on,in the public mind. He thinks,  
therefore, that the people will, in time, be  
unshakckled from their prejudices; and when  
ever that happens, they will themselves not

strong for the national government.  
  
** All the passions, then, we see, of avarice, ambition, interest,  
which govern most individuals, and all public bodies, fall into the  
current of the states, and do not flow into the stream of the gen-  
eral government. ‘The former, therefore, will generally be an  
overmatch for the general government, and render any confede-  
racy in its very nature precarious. ‘Theory is in this case fully  
confirmed by experience. ‘The Amphictyonic council had, it  
would seem, ample powers for general purposes. It had, in par-  
ticular, the power of fining and using force against delinquent  
members. What was the consequence? ‘Their decrees were  
mere signals of war. ‘The Phocian war is a striking example of  
it. Philip at length, taking advantage of their disunion, and insin-  
uating himself into their councils, made himself master of their  
fortunes. The German confederacy affords another lesson. The  
authority of Charlemagne seemed to be as great as could be neces-  
sary. The great feudal chiefs, however, exercising their local  
sovereignties, soon felt the spirit, and found the means, of  
encroachments, which reduced the imperial authority to a nominal  
sovereignty. The diet has succeeded, which, though aided by a  
prince at its head, of great authority independently of his imperial  
attributes, is a striking illustration of the weakness of confederated  
governments. Other examples instruct us in the same truth. The  
Swiss cantons have scarce any union at all, and have been more  
than once at war with one another.”

to Bt the old Confedeiation. : He  
was “fully convinced, that no amendment  
of the Confederation, leaving the States  
in possession of their sovereignty, could  
possibly answer the purpose. The great  
question,” he observed, “ is, what provi-  
sion shall we make for the happiness of  
the country?’ He then proceeded to  
enumerate and illustrate some of the great  
essential principles which he thought ne-  
cessary for the support of government.  
He mentioned, first, an active and con-  
stant interest in supporting it; secondly,  
the love of power; thirdly, an habitual  
attachment of the people; fourthly, force,  
by which may be understood a coercion  
of laws or coercion of arms; fifthly, influ-  
ence—* he did not mean corruption, but  
a dispensation of those regular honors and  
emoluments which produce an attachment  
to the government :” that “almost all the  
weight of these is on the side of the  
States, and must continue so as long as  
the States continue to exist. All the pas-  
sions, then,” he continued, “ of avarice,  
ambition, interest, which govern most  
individuals and all public bodies, fall into  
the current of the States, and do not flow  
into the stream of the general government.  
The former, therefore, will generally be  
an overmatch for the general government,  
and render any confederacy in its very  
nature precarious.” In proof and illus-

example of the Amphictyonic Council

the Union, he concluded, by way of inference,—* That we  
ought to go as far, in order to attain stability and permanency,  
as republican principles will admit. Let one branch of the  
legislature hold their places for life, or at least, during good  
behavior. Let the executive also be forlife. . . . . But  
is this a republican government? it will be asked. Yes, if all  
the magistrates are appointed and vacancies are filled by the  
people, or a process of election originating with the people.  
He was sensible that an executive constituted as he proposed,  
would have in fact but little of the power and independence  
that might be necessary. On the other plan, of appointing  
him for seven years, he thought the executive ought to have but  
little power. He would be ambitious, with the means of mak-  
ing creatures; and as the object of his ambition would be to  
prolong his power, it is probable that in case of war, he would  
avail himself of the emergency, to evade or refuse a degrada-  
tion from his place. An executive for life has not this motive  
for forgetting his fidelity, and will, therefore, be a safer deposi-  
tory of power.  
  
“Tt will be objected, probably, that such an executive will  
be an elective monarch, and will give birth to the tumults  
which characterize that form of government. He would re-  
ply, that monarch is an indefinite term. It marks not either  
the degree or duration of power. If this executive magistrate  
would be a monarch for life, the other proposed by the report

ration or a century. So the Americans were compelled to have an  
elected President, and no part of the Constitution gave the framers.  
thereof such trouble as the Chief Magistracy.  
  
In the Constitutional Convention (1787) Mr. Hamilton, who was  
in favour of a President and senators holding their places for life,  
said that “the British Government was the best in the world; and  
he doubted much whether anything short of it would do in America.

on the business before the convention, partly from respect to  
others whose superior abilities, age and experience rendered  
him unwilling to bring forward ideas dissimilar to theirs, and

too serious to permit any scruples whatever to prevail over the  
duty imposed onevery man to contribute his efforts for the  
public safety and happiness. He was obliged therefore to de-  
clare himself opposed to both plans. Te was particularly op-  
posed to that from New Jersey, being fully convinced that no  
amendment of the confederation, leaving the states with their  
sovereignty, could possibly answer the purpose. He agreed  
with Mr. Randolph that we owed it to our country to do in  
this emergency whatever we should deem essential to its hap-  
piness. The states sent us here to provide for the exigencies  
of the union. To rely on and propose any plan not adequate  
to these exigencies, merely because it was not clearly within  
our powers, would be to sacrifice the means to the end. The  
great question is, what provision shall we make for the happi-  
ness of our country? Ue would first make a comparative ex-  
amination of the two plans, prove that there were essential de -  
fects in both, and point out such changes as might render a

Necker that the British is the only government in the world  
which unites public strength with individual security, he in-  
quired what is the inference from all these observations, and  
answered that we ought to go as far, in order to attain stability  
and permanency as republican principles will admit. Te said  
let one branch of the legislature hold their places for life, or  
at least during good behavior. Let the executive also be for  
life. But is this a republican government it will be asked?  
He answered yes, if all the magistrates are appointed and  
vacancies are filled by the people, or a process of election  
originating with the people. , He thought if the executive  
held for only seven years he ought to have but. little  
power, for he would then be ambitious, with the means of  
making creatures, and in such a case he might even prolong  
his power. He said an executive for life has not this motive  
for forgetting his fidelity, and will therefore be a safer deposi-  
tory of power. He said, in answer, that such an executive  
  
would be a monarch for life; that it would then follow that

He remarked also that federal government meant an asso-  
ciation of independent communities into one ; that in some in-  
stances the powers were exercised over collective bodies, in  
others over individuals, as in the German diet. [le thought  
mere federation of community tended to anarchy. He was  
aware that he was in advance of most members, and after  
making one of the greatest speeches ever heard in that conven-  
tion, he read his sketch of a constitution, which he said he  
should prefer to either of the plans under consideration. He  
concludes by saying that the people are advancing, and will  
not be satisfied at stopping where the plan of Mr. Randolph  
would place them; that they would not be satisfied in stopping  
short of what he proposed. Me did not offer the paper he had  
read as a proposition to the convention, it was meant only to  
give a more correct view of his ideas and to suggest the amend-

not mean, however, to shock the public
