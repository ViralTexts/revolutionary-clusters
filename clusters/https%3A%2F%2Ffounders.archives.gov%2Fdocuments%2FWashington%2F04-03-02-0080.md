. With respect to ourselves, I wish I could add, that as much wisdom had pervaded our Councils; as reason &amp; common policy most evidently dictated; but the truth is, the people must feel before they will see; consequently, are brought slowly into measures of public utility. Past experience, or the admonitions of a few, have but little weight—where ignorance, selfishness &amp; design possess the major part: but evils of this nature work their own cure; tho’ the remedy comes slower than those who foresee, or think they foresee the danger, attempt to effect. With respect to the commercial system which G: B: is pursuing with this Country, the Ministers, in this as in other matters, are defeating their own ends, by facilitating those powers in Congress which will produce a counter action of their plans, &amp; which half a century without, would not have invested that body with. The restriction of our trade, &amp; the additional duties which are imposed upon many of our staple commodities, have put the commercial people of this Country in motion; they now see the indispensible necessity of a general controuling power, and are addressing their respective Assemblies to grant this to Congress. Before this every State thought itself competent to regulate its own Trade, &amp; were verifying the observations of Lord Sheffield; who supposed we never could agree upon any general plan: but those who will go a little deeper into matters, than his Lordship seems to have done, will readily perceive that in any measure where the Foederal interest is touched, however wide apart the politic’s of  
  
individual States may be, yet as soon as it is discovered they will always unite to effect a common good.

ctical knowledge to conduct the business; but where to find him we know not at present: In the meanwhile, the less difficult parts of the river will be attempted, that no time may be lost in effecting so important &amp; salutary an undertaking.  
Our course of Husbandry in this Country, &amp; more especially in this State, is not only exceedingly unprofitable, but so destructive to our Lands, that it is my earnest wish to adopt a better; &amp; as I believe no Country has carried the improvment of Land &amp; the benefits of Agriculture to greater perfection than England, I have asked myself frequently of late, whether a thorough bred practical english Farmer, from a part of England where Husbandry seems to be best understood &amp; is most advantageously practiced, could not be obtain’d? And upon what terms? The thought having again occurred to me, whilst I was in the act of writing this letter, I resolved as a more certain &amp; eligible mode of having the questions determined, to propound them to you—That a man of character &amp; knowledge may be had for very high wages there can be no doubt—money we know will fetch any thing, &amp; command the service of any man; but with the former I do not abound. To engage a man upon shares as the Overseers of this Country are, might be productive of much discontent to the employed; for we could scarcely convey to a good English Farmer a just idea of the wretched condition of our Lands—what dressings they will require, &amp; how entirely our system must be changed to make them p

hings—A Farm of about 200 or 250 acres  
  
of cleared Land, to be stocked with a competent number of Plows—black Cattle—Sheep &amp; hogs?  
When I speak of a knowing Farmer, I mean one who understands the best course of Crops; how to plough—to sow—to mow—to hedge—to Ditch &amp; above all, Midas like, one who can convert every thing he touches into manure, as the first transmutation towards Gold: in a word one who can bring worn out &amp; gullied Lands into good tilth in the shortest time. I do not mean to put you to the trouble of actually engaging one, but I should be obliged to you for setting on foot the enquiry, &amp; for communicating the result of it to me; because I could not receive your answer in time for the next year; the autumn being, as you well know, the season at which our Overseers are engaged, &amp; our plans for the ensuing Crop must be formed. These enquiries, as you will readily perceive, are pointed to a Farmer of the midling class; which more than probably, would best answer my purpose: but, if it could be made convenient to you to extend your enquiries further; permit me to ask if one of a higher order could be had? And upon what terms? I mean for a Steward.  
It may not in this place be amiss to observe to you that I still decline the growth of Tobacco; &amp; to add, that it is my intention to raise as little Indian corn as may be: in a word, that I am desirous of entering upon a compleat course of husbandry as practiced in the best Farming Counties of England. I enquire for a man of this latter description with little hope of success—1st because I believe one who is compleatly fit for my purposes, wou’d be above my price; &amp; 2dly because I have taken up an idea that an English steward is not so much a farmer, as he is an Attorney or an Accomptant; because few of the Nobility &amp; Gentry having their Estates in their own hands—stand more in need of a Collector who, at the same time that he receives the rents, will see that the Covenants of the Leases are complied with, repairs made &amp;c. &amp;c., than of a Farmer. In this however I may be mistaken. One thing more &amp; then I will close this long letter: if from your own observation, or from good information you should fix your eyes upon men of one or both of these descriptions—&amp; could ascertain his or their terms (leaving me at liberty to accede to them or not, within a reasonable time for an intercourse by letter)—I had rather he or they should be personally known to you; or their characters well ascertained by a  
  
friend in whom you can confide; because what you or such a person would say of them, I could rely upon: but how often do we find recommendations given without merit to deserve them—founded in a disposition to favor the Applicant, or want of resolution to refuse Him—oftentimes indeed, to get rid of a dependant who is troublesome or injurious to us, upon what are called decent terms. A man in the character of a Steward (if single, &amp; his appearance equal to it) would live in the House with me &amp; be at my table, in the manner Lund Washington was accustomed to do, who is now married and a House Keeper tho’ still attending my business. The common Farmer would live on the Farm which would be entrusted to his care.

out the establishment of some sovereigu organ of the public  
will, by which the haughty spirit of their rivals might be re-  
duced to a tone of compromise and accommodation.  
  
‘ With respect to the commercial system which Great Britain is  
pursuing with this country,’ says Washington, * the ministers in this  
as in other matters are detcating their own end, by facilitating the  
grant of those powers to congress,which will produce a counteraction  
of their plans, and with which but for those plans half a century  
would not have invested that body.  
  
* ‘The restrictions on our trade, and the additional duties which  
are imposed on many of our staple commodities, have put all the  
commercial people of this country in motion. They now sce the  
indispensable necessity of a general controlling power, and are ad-  
dressing their respective assemblies to grant it to congress. Before  
this, every state thought itself competent to regulate its own trade ;  
and we were verilyiog the observations of Lord Sheffield, who sup-  
posed we never could agree on any general plan. But those who  
will goa little deeper into matters than his lordship seems to have  
done, will perceive that in any measure when the general interest is  
touched, however wide apart the politics of individual states may be,  
  
et as soon as it is discovered, they will unite to effect a common  
  
good.’ Vol. v. p. 94
