I do not know whether the Professor to whom Antient and Modern history are assigned in the University, have yet decided on the course of historical reading which they will recommend to their schools. if they have, I wish this letter to be considered as not written; as their course, the result of mature consideration, will be preferable to any thing I could recommend. under this uncertainty, and the rather as you are of neither of these schools I may hazard some general ideas, to be corrected by what they may recommend hereafter.In all cases I prefer original author to compilers. for a course of Antient history therefore, of Greece and Rome especially, I should advise the usual suite of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Diodorus, Livy, Caesar, Suetonius, Tacitus and Dion, in their originals, if understood, and in translations if not. for it’s continuation to the final destruction of the empire we must then be content with Gibbons, a compiler, and with Segur, for a judicious recapitulation of the whole. after this general course, there are a number of particular histories, filling up chasms, which may be read at leisure in the progress of life, such as Arrian, Q. Cortius, Polybius, Sallust, Plutarch, Dionysius Halicarnasseus, Micali Etc. the Antient Universal history should be on our shelves as a book of general reference, the most learned, and most faithful perhaps that ever was written. it’s style is very plain, but perspicuous.In modern history, there are but two nations with whose course it is interesting to us to be intimately acquainted, to wit, France and England. for the former Millot’s general history of France may be sufficient to the period when Davila commences. he should be followed by Perefixe, Sully, Voltaire’s Louis XIV. and XV. la Cretelle’s XVIIIme siecle. Marmontel’s Regence, Toulongeon’s French revolution and Mde de Stael’s; making up, by a succession of particular histories the general one which they want.Of England there is as yet no general history so faithful as Rapin’s he may be followed by Ludlow, Fox, Balsham, Hume and Brodie. Hume’s were it faithful, would be the finest piece of history which has ever been written by man. it’s unfortunate bias may be partly ascribed to the accident of his having written backwards. his maiden work was the history of the Stuarts. it was a first essay to try his strength before the public. and whether as a Scotchman, he had really a partiality for that family, or thought that the lower their degradation the more fame he should acquire by raising them up to some favor, the object of his work was an Apology for them. he spared nothing therefore to wash them white, and to palliate their misgovernment. for this purpose he suppressed truths, advanced falsehoods, forged authorities, and falsified records. all this is proved on him unanswerably by Brodie. but so bewitching was his style and manner, that his readers were unwilling to doubt any thing, swallowed every thing, and all England became Tories by the magic of his art. his pen revolutionised the public sentiment of that country more compleatly than the standing armies could ever have done, which were so much dreaded and deprecated by the patriots of that day.Having succeeded so eminently in this acquisition of fortune and fame by this work, he undertook the history of the two preceding dynasties, the Plantagenets and Tudors. it was all important in this 2d work to maintain the thesis of his 1st that ‘it was the people who incroached on the sovereign, not the sovereign who usurped on the rights of the people.’ and again, Chapt. 53. ‘the grievances under which the English labored [to wit whipping, pillorying, cropping imprisoning fining Etc.] when considered in themselves, without regard to the constitution, scarcely deserve the name. nor were they either burthensome on the people’s properties, or any wise shocking to the natural humanity of mankind.’ during the constant wars, civil and foreign, which prevailed while these two families occupied the throne, it was not difficult to find abundant instances of practices the most despotic, as are wont to occur in times of violence. to make this 2d epoch support the 3d therefore required little garbling of authorities. and it then remained, by a 3d work, to make of the whole a compleat history of England, on the principles on which he had advocated that of the Stuarts. this would comprehend the Saxon and Norman conquests, the former exhibiting the genuine form, and political principles of the people constituting the Nation, and founded in the rights of man, the latter built on conquest and physical force, not at all affecting moral rights, nor ever assented to by the free will of the vanquished. the battle of Hastings indeed was lost. but the natural rights of the nation were not staked on the event of a single battle. their will to recover the Saxon constitution continued unabated, and was at the bottom of all the unsuccesful insurrections which succeeded in subsequent times. the victors and vanquished continued in a state of living hostility, and the nation may still say after losing the battle of Hastings—‘What tho’ the field is lost?All is not lost; the unconquerable willAnd study of revenge, immortal hateAnd courage never to submit or yield’the government of a nation may be usurped by the forcible intrusion of an individual into the throne. but to conquer it’s will, so as to rest the right on that the only legitimate basis, requires long acquiescence and cessation of all opposition.The whig historians of England therefore have always gone back to the Saxon period for the true principles of their constitution; while the Tories and Hume, their Coryphæus, date it from the Norman conquest, and hence conclude that the continual claim by the nation, of the good old Saxon laws, and the struggles to recover them were ‘encroachments of the people on the crown, and not usurpations of the crown on the people.’ Hume, with Brodie should be the last histories of England to be read. if first read, Hume makes an English tory, from whence it is an easy step to American toryism.—but there is a History by by Baxter, in which, abridging somewhat by leaving out some entire incidents as less interesting now than when Hume wrote, he has given the rest in the identical words of Hume, except that when he comes to a fact falsified, he states it truly, and when to a suppression of truths he supplies it never otherwise changing a word. it is in fact an editio expurgata of Hume. those who shrink from the volume of Rapin, may read this first and from this lay a first foundation in a basis of truth.For modern Continental history, a very general idea may be first aimed at, leaving for future and occasional reading, the particular histories of such countries as may excite curiosity at the time. this may be obtained from Mallet’s Northern antiquities, Voltaire’s Esprit et moeurs des nations, Millot’s modern history, Russel’s modern Europe, Hallam’s middle ages, and Robertson’s Charles V.You ask what book I would recommend to be first read in  Law. I am very glad to find, from a conversation with mr Gilmer that he considers Coke Littleton, as methodised by Thomas, as unquestionably the best elementary work, and the one which will be the Text-book of his school. it is now as agreeable reading as Blackstone, and much more profound.I pray you to consider this hasty and imperfect sketch as intended merely to prove my wish to be useful to you, and that, with it you will accept the assurance of my esteem and respectTh: Jefferso

Montickllo, Oct 25, 1825.  
Dear Sir: I do nut know whether the Profes­  
sors to whom Ancient and Modern History are  
assigned in the University, have yet decided on  
the course of Historical reading, which they  
will recommend to thfcir Schools, if they have,  
I wish this letter to be considered us not writ­  
ten—as their course, the result of mature con­  
sideration, will be preferable to any thing I  
could recommend. Under this uncertainly, 8c  
the rather as you are of neither of these Schools,  
I may hazard some general ideas, to he correct  
ed by what they may recommend hereafter.  
In alleases I prefer original authors to com­  
pilers. Fora course of Ancient History, there­  
fore, of Greece and Rome especially, I should  
advise the usual suite of Herodotus, Thucydi­  
des, Xenophon, Diodorus, Livy, Ccesar, Sue­  
tonius, Tacitus, and Dion, in their originals,  
if understood, and in translations if not. For  
its continuation to the final destruction of the  
Empire, we must then be content with Gib­  
bons, a compiler, and with Segur, for a judi­  
cious recapitulation of the whole. After this  
general course, there are a number of particu­  
lar Histories, filling up chasms, which may be  
read at leisure in the progress of life, such as  
\rrian,Q. Curtius, Polybius, Sallust, Plutarch,  
Dionysius Halicarnasseus, Micali, Sec. The  
Ancient Universal History should he on our  
shelves as a book of general reference, the most  
learned, and most faithful perhaps that ever  
was written. Its style is very plain, but per­  
  
spiCUOUb,  
In Modern History, there are but two na­  
tions with whose course it is interesting to us  
to be intimately acquainted, to wit: Frahce Sc  
England. For the former, Millot’s General  
History of France may be sufficient to the peri­  
od when Davila commences. He should be  
followed by Perefixe, Sully, Voltarie’s Louis  
XIV. and XV. la Cretelle’s 18me. siecle, Mar­  
montel’s Regence, Toulongeon’s French Revo­  
lution, and Md. de Stael’s; making up, by a  
succession of particular Histories, the general  
one which they want.  
Of England*-there is as yet no General His­  
tory as faithful as Rapin’s, he may be followed  
by Ludlow, Fox, Belsham, Hume, and Brodie;  
Hume’s, were it faithful, would be the finest  
piece of history .which has ever been written by  
man; its unfortunate bias may be partly ascrib­  
ed to the accident of his having written back­  
wards. His maiden work was the History of  
i he Stuarts; it was a first essay to try his strength  
before the public, and whether as a Scotchman  
he had really a partiality for that family, or  
thought that the lower their degradation, .the  
more fame he should acquire by raising them  
up to some favor, the object of his work was an  
apology for them—he spared nothing therefore  
to wash them white, and to palliate their mis­  
government. For this purpose, he suppressed  
truths, advanced falsehoods, forged authorities,  
and falsified records. All this is proved on him  
unanswerably by Brodie, but so bewitching was  
his st)leand manner, that his readers were un­  
willing to doubt any thing, swallowed every  
thing, and all England became Tories by the  
magic of his art. His pen revolutionized the  
public sentiment of that country more complete­  
ly than the standing armies could ever have  
  
done, which were so much dreaded and depre­  
cated by the patriots of that day.  
Having succeeded so eminently in the acqui­  
sition of fortune and fame by this work, he un­  
dertook the History of the two preceding dy­  
nasties, the Plantagenets and Tudors. It was  
all important, in this secood work, to maintain  
the thesis of his first, that ‘it was the People  
who encroached on the Sovereign, not the Sov­  
ereign who usurped on the rights of the Peo­  
ple.* And again, chapi. 53, the grievances un­  
der which the English labored, [to wits whip­  
ping, pillorying, cropping, imprisoning, fining,  
See.] when considered in themselves, without  
regard to ihe constitution, scarcely deserve  
the name. Nor were they either burthensome  
on the People’s properties, or any wise shock­  
ing to the natural humanity of mankind.’ Du­  
ring the constant wars, civil and foreign, which  
prevailed while these two families occupied  
the throne, it was not djfficult to find abun­  
dant instances of practices the most despo­  
tic, as are wont 10 occur in times of violence;  
to make this second epoch support the third  
therefore, required little garbling of author­  
ities. And if then remained, by a third work  
to make of the whole a complete History  
of England, on the principles on which  
he had advocated that of the Stuarts. T his  
would comprehend the Saxon and Norman con­  
quest: the former exhibiting the genuine iorm  
and political principles of the People, constitu­  
ting the nation, am! founded in the rights of  
man—the latter built on conquest and physical  
force, not at all affecting moral rights, nor even  
assented to by the free will of the vanquished.  
The battle of Hastings indeed was lost. But  
the natural rights of the nation were not staked  
on the event of a single battle. 1 heir will to  
recover the Saxon constitution, continued una­  
bated, and was at the bottom of all the unsuc­  
cessful insurrections which succeeded ip sub­  
sequent times. The victors and vanquished  
continued in a state of living hostility, and the  
nation may still stay, alter losing the battle of  
Hastings—  
  
-- ’wiiar, uio uie neiuis iosi:  
Allis not lost; the unconquerable will  
And study of revenge, immortal hate,  
And courage never to submit or yield.’  
The Government of a nation may be usurp­  
ed by the forcible intrusion of an individual in­  
| to the throne; but to conquer its will, so as to  
rest the right on that, the only legitimate basis,  
requires, long ucquiescence and cessation of all  
opposition The Whig Historians of England,  
therefore, have always gone hack to the Saxon  
period for the true principles of their constitu­  
tion; while the Tories, and Hume; their Cory­  
phaeus, date it from the Norman conquest, and  
hence,conclude that the continual claim by the  
nation, of the good old Saxon laws, and the  
struggle to recover them, were ‘encroachments  
of the People on the crown, and not usurpa­  
tions of the crown on the People.* Hume, with  
Brodie, should lie the last Histories of England  
to be read. If first read, Hume makes an Eng­  
lish Tory, from whence it is an easy step to  
American toryism—but there is a History by  
Baxter, in which, abridging somewhat by leav­  
ing out some entire incidents a-, less interesting  
now than when Hume wrote, he has given the  
rest in the identical woids of Hume, except  
that, when he comes to a fact falsified, he states  
it truly, and when to a suppressiou of truth, he  
supplies it; never otherwise changing a word;  
it is in fact an editio expurgata of Hume —  
Those who shrink from the volume of Rapin,  
mav read this first, and from this lay a first  
foundation in a basis of truth.  
For Modern Continental History, a very ge­  
neral idea may he first aimed at, leaving for fu­  
ture and occasional reading, the particular His­  
tories of such countries as may excite curiosi­  
ty at the time. This may be obtained from  
Mallet’s Northern Antiquities, Voltaire’s Es­  
prit et moeurs des Nations, Millot’s Modern  
History, Russel’s Modern Europe, Hallum’s  
Middle Ages, and Robertson’s Charles V.  
You ask what book I would recommend to be  
first read in law. I am very glad to find, from  
a conversation with Mr. Gilmer, that he consi­  
ders Coke Littleton, as methodized hv Thomas,  
as unquestionably the best elementary work,  
and the one which will he the text-book of his  
School. It is now as agreeable reading as  
Blackstone, and much more profound. I pray  
you to consider this hasty and imperfect sketch  
as intended merely to prove my wish to be use­  
ful to you, and that, with it, you will accept the  
assurance of my esteem and respect.  
THO. JEFFERSON

MoNTiCEi.ro, Oct. 2.&quot;»th, 1 B23.  
To Mr. J- V. K.  
Dr. mi Situ 1 do not know whether the professors.  
1.1 whom ancient, and modern History urc assigned  
at the University,have yet decided on the course of  
historical reading which they will recommend to their  
pehools. If they have, I wish this letter to bo con­  
tndered as not written; as their course, the result of  
jn it ure consideration, will be preferable to any thing  
I could recommend: Uad r this uncertainty, and the  
rather as yoy arc of neither of these schools, I in ay  
hazard some general ideas, to be corrected by vwhal  
they rpcpiumend hereafter.  
I i all cases I prefer original authors to compilers:  
For those of ancient history therefore, of Greece and  
Ronv especially, I should ndvisc the usual suite of  
Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Diurdnru*, Livy,  
(’a-sar, Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dion, in their origi­  
nals if understood, and in translations if not For its  
continuation to the final destruction of the Empire,  
we must bo content with Gibbon, n compiler; with  
Segnr fur a judicious recapitulation of the whole —  
After this general course, there aro a number of par  
f icular histories filling up chasms, which may be read  
at leisure in the progress of life, such ns Arrian. Q,.

Halicarnassus &amp;c. ,-Anc;CDt Universal Ilistorv”  
should boon our shelves as a hook of general reference,  
tiic most lenrned and most faithful perhaps that ever  
was written: its style is very plain, but perspicuous.  
In modern History, there arc but two tuitions with  
whose course, it is interesting to us to be intimately  
acquainted, to wit, Franc&lt;5 and England For the  
former. Mil lot’s Genera! History of France may b  
sufficient, to the period When pavilla commenced.—  
He should be followed by Pr^refixe, Sully, Voltaire’s

&#x27; (inn, and M de Do JSUsl’a: making up by o succession  
«f part cub r histories, the general one which they  
u aid.

is proven on him unanswerably by Urodie. Uut so !

every tiling; and nil England became lories!

in tlie (he acquisition of fortune and fame by this work,

head the Saxon and Norman conquests—tlte former

Monticello, Oct. 5ih, 1825.  
To Mr. J. V. K.  
Dear Sir : I do not know whether the pro­  
fetsois, to whoa ancient and modern History are  
assigned at the University, have yet decided on  
the course of historical reading which they will  
recommend to their schools. If they have. I  
wish this letter to be considered as not written ;  
as their course, the result of mature considera­  
tion, will be preferable to any thing I could re­  
commend. Under this uncertainty, and the ra­  
ther as you are of neither of these schools, I may  
hazard some general ideas, to be corrected by  
hat they recommend iu-reaiter.  
In all cases I prefer original authors to com  
pilers: for those of ancient history, therefore, of  
Greece and Komo especially, I should advise the  
usual suite of Herodotus, Thucydides, Xeno­  
pbon, Diodorus, Liry, Caesar, Suetonius, Ta­  
citus, and Dion, in their originals if understood,  
and in translations if not. For its continuation  
to. the final destruction of the Empire, we must  
be content with Gibbon, a compiler; with Segur  
for a judicious recapitulation of the whole. Af­  
ter this general course, there are a number of par­  
ticular histories filling up chasms, which may be  
read at leisure in the progress of life, such as  
Arrian, Q. Curtius, Polybius, Sallust, Plutarch,  
Diooysius&#x27;of Halicarnassus, Ac. &quot; Ancient Uni  
versal History should be on our shelves as a  
book of general reference, the most learned and  
most faithful, perhaps, that ever was written: its  
style is very plain, but perspicuous.  
la modern History, there are but two nations  
with whose course, it is interesting to us to bo  
intimately acquainted, to wit, France and Eng­  
land. For the former, Millott&#x27;s General Histo­  
ry of France may be sufficient, to the period  
when Davilla commenced. He should be fol­  
lowed by Prerefixe, Sully, Voltaire&#x27;s Louis XIV  
and XV... La Cretelle&#x27;s 18 me. Sitcle, Marmon­  
tel&#x27;s Regtnce, Toulongion&#x27;s French Revolution,  
and M&#x27;de De Steel&#x27;s : making up, by a succes­  
sion of particular histories, the general one which  
they want.  
Of England, there is no general history so  
faithful as Rapin&#x27;s. He may be followed by  
Ludlow, Fox, Belsham, Hume, and Brodie.  
Hume&#x27;s, were it faithful, would bo the finest piece  
of history that has ever been written by roan : its  
unfortunate bias may partly be ascribed to the ac­  
cident of his having written backwards. His  
maiden work, the history of the Stuarts, was a  
first essay to try his strength before the public  
And whether as a Scotchman ho really had a  
partiality for that family, or thought that the  
lower their degradation, the more fame ho  
should acquire by raising them up to some fa­  
vour; the object of his work was n apology for  
them. He spared nothing, therefore, to wash  
them white, and to palliate their misgovernmcnt;  
for this purpose, he suppressed truths, advanced  
falsehoods, forged authorities, and falsified re­  
cords: all this is proven on him unanswerably  
by Brodie. But so bewitching , were his style  
and manner, that his readers were unwilling to  
doubt any thing; swallowed every thing ; and all  
England became fortes by the magic ot his art.  
His pen revolutionized the public sentiment of  
that country-more completely than the standing  
armies could ever have done, which were so  
much dreaded and deprecated by the patriots of  
th it day. Having succeeded so eminently in the  
acquisition of fortune and fame by this work, he  
undertook the history of the two preceding dy­  
nasties, the Plantagenets and Tudors. It was  
all-important in this second work, to maintain  
the thesis of his first that &quot; it was the people  
who encroached on the sovereign ; net the sove­  
reign who usurped on the rights of the people.&quot;  
And again, chap. 53 : &quot; The grievances under  
which the English laboured,&quot; (to wit, whipping,  
pillorying, cropping, imprisoning, fining, dtc.)  
&quot; when considered in themselves, without regard  
to the Constitution, scarcely deserve the name.&#x27;  
Nor were they either burthensome on the peo­  
ple&#x27;s properties, or any wise shocking to the na­  
tural humanity of mankind.&quot; During the con­  
stant wars, civil and foreign, which prevailed  
while these two families occupied the throne, it  
was not difficult to find abundant instances of  
practices the most despotic, as are wont to occur  
in times of violence. To make this second epoch  
support the&#x27;third, therefore, required little gar­  
bling of authorities, and it remained by a third  
work, to make the whole a complete history, of  
England, on the principles on which he had ad­  
vocated the cause of the Stuarts. This would

the former exhibiting the general &#x27;and political  
priocijJes of the people constituting the, nation,  
and founded In the rights of man the latter built  
on conquest and mere physical force, not at all  
affecting moral rights, nor even submitted to by  
the free will of the vanquished.&#x27;, The battle of  
Hastings; indeed, was lost ; but the moral rights  
ot the nation were not staked on the event of  
single battle. Its will to recover the Saxon  
Constitution (laws) continued unabated, and was  
at the bottom of all (he unsuccessful insurrections  
which ensued in subsequent timos. The victors  
and the vanquished continued in a state of living  
hostilities ; and the nation might still say, after  
losing the battle or Hastings,  
. What tho&#x27; the fi.ld is lost 1 . &#x27; &#x27; &quot;  
All. is not lost: th&#x27; unconquerable will  
And study of revenge, immortal hate,  
, And courage never to submit oryield.&#x27;.  
Tho government of a nation may be usurped by  
the forcible intrusion of an individual into the  
throne; but to conquer itsynu;, so at to vest the  
right on that, the only legitimate basis, requires  
long acquiescence and the cessation of all oppo­  
sition. The Whig historians of England, there­  
fore, have always gone back to the Saxon period,  
for the true principles of their Constitution ;  
while the Tories, and Hume their Coryphceus,  
date it from the Norman Conquest,- and hence  
conclude, that the Constitutional claim by the  
nation of the good old Saxon laws, and the strug  
gles to recover them, were &quot; encroachments of  
the people on the crown, and not usurpations of  
the crorn on the people.&quot; . Hume, with Brodie,  
should be the last histories of England to be read;  
if first read, Hume makes an English Tory, from  
whence it is an easy step to American Toryism.  
But there is a history by Baxter, in which,  
abridging somewhat by leaving out some entire  
incidents as less interesting now than when  
Hume wrote, he has given the rest in the identi­  
cal words of Hume, except that when he comes  
to a fact falsified, he states it truly, and when to  
a suppression of truth, he supplies it; never  
otherwise changing a word. It is, in fact, an  
tditio cxpurgata of Hume. Those who shrink  
from the volume of Rapin, may read this first ;  
and from this, lay a first foundation in the basis  
ot truth.  
Of Modern Continental History, a very gene  
ral idea may be hrst arrived at; leaving for fu  
ture and occasional reading, the particular histo  
ries of such countries as may excite curiosity at  
the time. This may be obtained from Mallet&#x27;s  
Northern Antiquities, Voltaire&#x27;s Espri et mcears  
des Nations, Millot&#x27;s Modern History, Russel&#x27;s  
Modern Europe, Hallam s Middle Ages, and  
Robertson&#x27;s Charles V.  
You ask what book I would recommend to be  
first read in Law. I am glad to find, from  
conversation with Mr. Gilmer, that he considers  
Coke on Littleton as methodised by Thomas, as  
unquestionably the best elementary work, and  
the one which will be the text book of his school.  
It is now as agreeable reading as Blackstooe, and  
much more profound.  
I pray you to consider this hasty and imperfect  
sketch as intended merely to prove my wish to  
be useful to you, and that with it, you will ac­  
cept the assurance of my esteem and respect. &#x27; &#x27;

it would be the finest piece of history that ever was

to the accident of his having writfen backwards. His  
maiden work was the history of ghe Stuaris—the object  
of this work was an apology forthem. He spared no-  
thing, therefore, to wash them white and to palliate  
their misgovermacnt. bk orthis purpose he suppressed  
truths, advanced fuiseioods, forged authorities, and  
falsified records. All thisis proved on him unansweyra-

with Rollin, for a judi
