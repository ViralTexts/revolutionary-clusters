Baton Rouge  
July 25th 1813  
From a knowledge that research into the history of the primitive inhabitants of America, is one of your favorite amusements, I take the liberty of making this communication.  
			 my attention to the subject, was first awakened on  
			 reading when a boy, the observations  
			 contained in the  
			 “Notes on Virginia” and it has become, with me, a favorite theme of speculation. I often visited the mound, and other remains of Indian Antiquity in the neighbourhood of Pittsburgh, my native town, attracted by a pleasing interest of which I scarcely knew the cause, and afterwards read, and heard with delight, whatever related to these monuments of the first, or rather earlier, inhabitants of my native country. Since the year 1810.  
			 (without previously intending it) I have visited almost every thing of this kind, worthy of note on the Ohio and mississippi, and from examination and reflection, something like hypothesis, has taken the place of the vague wanderings of fancy. The following is a sketch of the result of those observations.  
Throughout what is denominated by Volney, the valey of the mississippi, there exist the traces of a population far beyond what this extensive and fertile portion of the Continent, is supposed to have possessed: greater perhaps, than could be supported of the  
			 present white inhabitants, even with the careful agriculture practised in the most populous parts of Europe. The reason of this, is to be found in the peculiar manners of the inhabitants by whom it was formerly  
			 occupied; like those  
			 of mexico their agriculture had for ites its only object their own sustenance; no surpluss was demanded for commerce with foreign nations, and no part of the soil susceptible of culture, was devoted to pasturage; yet, extensive forrests forests filled with wild animals would still remain. The aggregate population of the country might be less, but that of particular districts much greater. We must in this way, account for the  
			 astonishing population of the vale of mexico when first known to the Spaniards: perhaps equal to any district of the Same extent of china. (See Humbolt page 127 vol: 2) The astonishing population of Owhyhee, and Otaheita, must be accounted for in the same way. There are certainly many districts on the ohio and mississippi equally favourable to a numerous population: when I contemplate the beauty and fertility of those spots, I could scarcl   
scarcely beleive it possible, that they should never have supported a numerous population; such a fact would form an exception to what has usually occured, in every other part of the Globe;  
  
In The valley of the mississippi, there are discovered the traces of two distinct races of people, or  periods of population, one much more ancient than the other. The traces of the last are much more numerous, but mark a population less advanced in civilization; in fact they belong to the same race as existed in the country when the French and English effected their settlements on this  
			 part of the Continent: but Since the intercourse of these people with the whites and the astonishing dimunition in numbers, many of their customs have fallen into disuse—it is not more than a hundred and twenty years, since the character of the population, which left the traces of the second  
			 period, underwent a change. The appearances of fortifications of which so much has been Said, and which have been attributed to a colony of Welch, are nothing more than the traces of pallisadoed  
			 towns or villages. The first travellers mention this custom of surrounding their towns with pallisades; the earth was thrown up a  
			 few feet and  
			 pickets placed on the top: I have Seen old volumes  
			 in  
			 which they are represented in the engravings The Arikara and Mandan villages are still fortified in this way. The traces of these are astonishingly numerous in the Western country: I should not exagerate if I were to say five thousand might be found. Some of them enclose more than an hundred acres. From some cause or other (and we know that there are enough which might suffice to effect it) the population had been astonishingly diminished immediately before we became acquainted with them; and yet Charlevoix mentions a town of the mascutin tribe (at present incorporated with the kickapoos) containing a  
			 thousand  
			 families. the barrows, or general resceptacles of the dead, such as examined by yourself, may be classed with the pallisadoed towns, though they are much more numerous; they are in fact, to be  
			 found  
			 in almost every cornfield in the Western country. The tumuli or mounds are often met with,  
			 where there is no appearance of pallisadoed villages or fortifications, or of barrows.  
The first and more ancient period, is marked by those extraordinary tumuli or mounds. I have reason to beleive that their antiquity is verry great. The oldest Indians have no tradition as to their Authors, or the purposes for which they were originally intended; yet they were unconsciously formerly in the habit of using them for one of the purposes for which they were at first designed to wit as places of defence. The old chief Du Coin, told mr Rice Jones that the mounds in the American Bottom had been fortified by the Kaskaskias in their wars with the Iroquois.  
			 An old work by Lafitau a jesuit, which I met with at New Orleans, contains a curious plate in which one of these mounds fortified by pallisades on the top and large beams extending to the bottom, is assaulted by enemies. These tumuli as well as the  
			 fortifications, are to be found at the junction of all the considerable rivers, in the most eligible positions for towns, and in the most extensive bodies of fertile land. Their number exceeds  
			 perhaps three thousand; the smallest not less than twenty feet in height, and one hundred in diameter at the base. Their great number, and the astonishing size of some of them, may be regarded as furnishing with  
			 other circumstances evidence of their antiquity: I have been Sometimes induced to think that at the period when those mounds were constructed, there existed on the mississippi, a population  as  
			 numerous as that which once animated the borders of the nile or of the Euphrates, or of mexico and Peru.  
The most numerous, as well as the most considerable of these remains, are found precisely in the part of the country where the traces of numerous population might be looked for, to wit, from the mouth of the Ohio (on the East Side of the mississippi) to the Illinois river, and on the west Side from the St Francis to the missouri: I am perfectly Satisfied that cities Similar to those of Ancient Mexico, of several hundred thousand souls have existed in this part of the country. Nearly opposite St Louis there are the traces of two such cities, in the distance of five miles, on the bank of the cohokia, which crosses the American bottom at this place. There are not less than one hundred mounds, in two different groups; one of the mounds falls little short of the Egyptian pyramid Mycerius. when I examined it in 1811, I was astonished that this stupendious monument of Antiquity Should have been unnoticed by any traveller: I afterwards published an account in the newspapers at St Louis, detailing its dimensions describing its form, position &amp;a, but this, which I thought might almost be considered a discovery, attracted no notice: and yet I stated it to be eight hundred paces in circumference (the exact Size of the pyramid of  
			 Asychis.) and one hundred feet in height. The mounds at Grave creek and Marietta are of the Second or third class. The mounds at St Louis, at new Madrid, and at the commencement of Black river, are all larger than those of Marietta. The following is an enumeration of the most considerable mounds on the mississippi and on the Ohio; the greater part I examined myself with such attention as the short time I had to spare would permit.  
1. At Great creek, below Wheeling  
2. At Pittsburgh  
3. At Marietta  
4. Cincinati  
5. New Madrid—one of them 350 feet diameter at the base  
6. Bois Brule bottom, 15 miles, below St Genevieve  
7. At St Genevieve  
8. mouth of the marameck  
9. St Louis—one with two Stages another with three  
10. mouth of the missouri  
11. on the cohokia river—in two groups—  
12. twenty miles below—two groups also, but the mound of a smaller size—on the back of a lake formerly the bed of the river.  
13. near Washington (M.T.) 146 feet in height  
14 At Baton Rouge and on the bayou Manchac one of the mounds near the lake is chiefly composed of shells. the inhabitants have taken away great quantities for the purpose of making lime—  
15. The mound on Black river—of two stages,—with a group around it—  
At each of these places there are groupes of mounds; and at each there probably once existed a city. On the other considerable rivers which are tributary to the Ohio and mississippi, in Kentucky Tennessee, State of Ohio, Indiana Territory &amp;a they are equally numerous. But the principal city and center of population was between the ohio, mississippi, missouri, and Illinois, I have been informed that in the plains between the Arkansa and St Francis they are numerous and some verry large—They resemble the Teocalli, in these important features. 1—in their positions the cardinal points are observed with considerable accuracy. 2—The larger mounds have several stages, 3—in every group there  
			 are two mounds  
			 much larger than the others—4 The Smaller mounds are placed around Symetrically. A closer examination would show a resemblance in other particulars.  
			 It is doubted  
			 by Humbolt Humboldt whether advantage had not been taken of some natural rise, in the formation of the pyramid of cholula; with respect to the mound of Cohokia there can be no doubt for it stands in the midst of Alluvium, and there is no natural hill nearer than two miles. (See the account of the Teocalli of New Spain by Humboldt pages 16.—41.—44.—123.—170. &amp;a vol 2)  
Such are the appearances of Antiquity in the western country, which I consider as furnishing proof of an ancient and numerous population. The resemblance to those of New Spain would render probable the existence of the Same arts and customs; perhaps an intercource. The distance from the large mound on red river to the nearest in New Spain, is not so great but that they might be conss considered as existing in the same country.—  
From the description of the adoratorios, as they are called, it appears highly probable that the mounds on the mississippi were destined for the same purposes. Solis tells us, that every considerable place, had a number of them, upon which a kind of tower was erected, and which gave rise to the beleif of those who first visited the coast of new Spain that they had seen cities with numerous steeples, (Dr Robertson who is disposed to lessen every thing American, and to treat with  contempt unworthy of a philosopher, all their arts and advancement in civilization, attributes this to the imaginations of  
			 the Spaniards, inflamed with the spirit of Quixottic adventure) from which circumstance they bestowed upon it the name of their native country. The four great  
			 cities to which the general name of Mexico was given, contained two thousand of these adoratorios or teocalli; at the first glance this vast population, equal perhaps to London or Paris, appeared to be  crowned with inn inumerable towers and steeples. Architecture was perhaps too much in its infancy to enable them to build to any great height, a mound was therefore raised, and an a building erected on the top. It was in this way the temple of Belus, at Babylon was erected, and the Egyptian pyramids of the Second class which are Solid and probably the most ancient.  
			 Besides being places of adoration, the Teocali also Served as fortresses; they were  
			 usually the last places, to which the inhabitants of the cities conquered by Cortes, resorted after having been driven from every other quarter.  
They were enabled from the position, form, and the tower on the top, to defend themselves in these places to great advantage. Placed from the bottom to the top of the mount, by gradations above each other, they appear’d (as Solis in his animated Style expresses it) to constitute “a living hill”; and at first, judging only from the experience of their own wars, they fancied themselves impregnable.  
From the oldest book extant, the bible, we see exemplified in numerous instances, the natural  predilection for resorting to high places; for the purpose of worship; this prevailed amongst all nations, and probably the first edifice dedicated to the Deity was an elevation of earth, the next step was the placing a temple on it, and finally churches &amp; mosques were built with steeples. This has prevailed in all countries: it may be considered the dictate of Nature. The most ancient temples of the Greeks: were erected on artificial, or natural elevations of earth; at the present day, almost every part of Europe and Asia, eh exhibit these remains of tumuli, the rudest, though perhaps the most lasting of human works. (See appendix to  
			 Volney’s view of America, Clarks travels in Russia &amp;a) The mausoleum, generally holds the next place to the temple; and what is remarkable, all nations in  
			 their wars have made  
			 the last stand in the edifices consecrated to their Gods, and near  
			 the tombs of their Ancestors. The Adoratorio of New Spain, like all works of the kind answered the three purposes, of the temple, the fortress and the mausoleum. Can we entertain a doubt but that this was also the case with those of the  
			 mississippi?  
The antiquity of these mounds, is certainly verry great; this is not infered from the growth of trees, which prove an antiquity of a few centuries, but from this Simple reflection; a people capable of works requiring So much labour, must be numerous, and if numerous Somewhat advanced in the Arts; we might therefore look for works of Stone or brick the traces of which would remain at least eight or ten centuries. The great mound of Cohokia, is evidently constructed with as much regularity as any of the Teocalli of new Spain, and was doubtless cased with brick or stone, and crowned with buildings, but of these no traces remain. Near the mound at St Louis, there are a few decaying Stones, but which may have been casually brought there. The pyramid of Papantla, in the Northern part of the Intendency of Vera Cruz unknown to the first conquerers, and discovered a few years ago, was still partly cased with brick. we might be justified in considering the mounds of the mississippi more ancient than the Teocalli: a fact worthy of notice, although the stages are still plain in Some of them, the gradations or steps have  
			 disappeared, in the course of time the rains having washed them off. The peices of obsidian or flint, are found in great quantities near them, as is the case with the Teocalli: Some might be  
			 Startled  
			 if I should say that the mound of Cohokia is as ancient as those of Egypt. The Mexicans possessed  
			 but imperfect traditions of the construction of their Teocalli: their traditions, attribute them to the Toultecs or to the Olmecs—who probably migrated from the mississippi.—  
who will pretend to speak with certainty as to the Antiquity of America—The races of men who have flourished and disappeared—of the thousand revolutions which like other parts of the Globe it has undergone? The philosophers of Europe with a narrowness and Selfishness of mind have endeavoured to depreciate every thing which relates to it. They have called it the New world, as though its formation was posterior to the rest of the habitable globe. A few facts suffice to repel this idea: the antiquity of her mountains, the remains of Volcanoes, the alluvial tracts, the wearing away of Cataracts &amp;a, and the number of primitive languages, greater perhaps than in all the rest of the world besides. The use of letters, and the discovery of the mariners compass, the invention of gunpowder  
			 &amp; of printing, have produced incalculable changes in the Old world. I question much whether before those periods, comparitively recent, there existed or could exist any nationes more civilized than the mexicans, or Peruvians. In morals, the Greeks and Romans in their most enlightened days were not Superior to the mexicans. We are told that these poo people Sach Sacrifised human beings to their Gods! did not the Romans Sacrifise their unfortunate prisoners to their depraved and wicked pleasures, compelling them to kill each other. What was the sacrifice of Ephigenia, to obtain a favourable Wind? an act of less barbarity than the sacrifises by the mexicans of their prisoners on the altar of their Gods? The Peruvians were exempt from these crimes—perhaps  
			 the mildest and most innocent people that ever lived, and in the arts as much advanced as were the ancient Persians or Egyptians, not only in the arts but even in the Scen Sciences. Was ever any work of the old world superior to the two roads from Quito to Cusco?  
Pardon me, Sir, for troubling you with this long, and perhaps tiresome letter, dictated probably by the vanity of personally communicating my crude theories to one who holds so distinguished a place in that temple of Science which is of no country and of no age—  
with Sentiments of the highest respect I am, Sir Your most obedient Humble Servant

appears extraordinary. From the growth of trees on some of them,  
they show an antiquity of at least several hundred years. The In-  
dians have no tradition as to the founders of them, though there is  
no doubt but that when we first became acquainted with those  
people, they were used as places of defence. The old chief of  
the Kaskaskia Indians, told Mr. Rice Jones, that in the wars of

Baton Rouge, July 25, 1813.  
Sir,  
  
From a knowledge that research into the history of the  
primitive inhabitants of America, is one of your favourite  
amusements, I take the liberty of making this communication.  
My attention to the subject, was first awakened on reading,  
wher a boy, the observations contained in .the “ Notes on  
Virginia,” and it has become, with me, a favourite theme of  
speculation. I often visited the mound, and other remains of  
Indian antiquity in the neighbourhood of Pittsburgh, my native  
town, attracted by a pleasing interest, of which I scarcely knew  
the cause, and afterwards read, and heard with delight, what-  
ever related to these monuments of the first, or rather earlier,  
inhabitants of my native country. Since the year 1810 (with-  
out previously intending it) I have visited almost every thing  
of this kind, worthy of note on the Ohio and Mississippi ; and  
from examination and reflection, something like hypothesis.  
has taken the place of the vague wanderings of fancy. The  
following is a sketch of the result of those observations.

beyond what this extensive and fertile portion of the continent,  
is supposed to have possessed: greater, perhaps, than could  
be supported of the present white inhabitants, even with the  
careful agriculture practised in the most populous parts of  
Europe. The reason of this, is to be found in the peculiar  
manners of the inhabitants by whom it was formerly occupied;  
like those of Mexico, their agriculture had for its only object  
their own sustenance; no surplus was demanded for com-  
merce with foreign nations, and no part of the soil, susceptible  
of culture, was devoted to pasturage ; yet, extensive forests  
filled with wild animals would still remain. The aggregate  
population of the country might be less, but that of particular  
districts much greater. We must, in this way, account for the  
astonishing population of the vale of Mexico, when first known  
to the Spaniards; perhaps equal to any district of the same  
extent of climate.* The astonishing population of Owyhee,  
and Otaheite, must be accounted for in the same way. There  
are certainly many districts on the Ohio and Mississippi equally  
favourable to a numerous population. When I contemplated  
the beauty and fertility of those spots, I could scarcely believe  
it possible, that they should never have supported a numerous  
population; such a fact would form an exception to what has  
usually occurred, in every other part of the globe.  
  
II. In the valley of the Mississippi, there are discovered the  
traces of two distinct races of people, or periods of popula-  
tion, one much more ancient than the other. The traces of  
the last are the most numerous, but mark a population less  
advanced in civilization ; in fact, they belong to the same race  
that existed in the country when the French and English effect-  
ed their settlements on this part of the continent: but since the  
intercourse of these people with the whites, and their asto-  
nishing diminution in numbers, many of their customs have  
fallen into disuse. It is not more than a hundred and twenty  
years, since the character of the population, which left the  
traces of the second period, underwent a change. The ap

pearances of fortifications, of which so much has been said,  
and which have been attributed to a colony of Welch, are  
nothing more than the traces of pallisadoed towns or villages.  
The first travellers mention this custom of surrounding their  
towns with pallisades; the earth was thrown up a few feet,  
and pickets placed on the top. I have seen old volumes in  
which they are represented in the engravings.* The Arikara  
and Mandan villages are still fortified in this way. The traces  
of these are astonishingly numerous in the western country ;  
I should not exaggerate if I were to say that five thousand  
might be found. Some of them inclose more than an hundred  
acres. From some cause or other (and we know that there  
are enough which might suffice to effect it) the population had  
been astonishingly diminished immediately before we became  
acquainted with them; and yet Charlevoix mentions a town  
of the Mascutin tribe (at present incorporated with the Kick-  
apoos) containing a thousand families! The barrows, or gen-  
eral receptacles of the dead, such as examined by yourself,  
may be classed with the pallisadoed towns, though they are  
much more numerous; they are, in fact, to be found in almost  
every cornfield in the western country. The tumuli or mounds,  
are often met with, where there is no appearance of pallisadoed  
villages or fortifications, or of barrows.  
  
Ill. The first and more ancient period, is marked by those  
extraordinary tumuli or mounds. I have reason to believe that  
their antiquity is very great. The oldest Indians have no tra-  
dition as to their authors, or the purposes for which they were  
originally intended ; yet they were formerly, I might almost  
say instinctively, in the habit of using them for one of the  
purposes for which they were at first designed, to wit, as  
places of defence. The old chief Du Coin, told Mr. Rice Jones  
that the mounds in the American bottom had been fortified  
by the Kaskaskias in their wars with the Iroquois. An old

Congress, which contains the most valuable collection of Books on America  
to be found in any part of the world.

work by Lafitau, a jesuit, which I met with at New Orleans,  
contains a curious plate in which one of these mounds forti-  
fied by pallisades on the top, and large beams extending to  
the bottom, is assaulted by enemies. These tumuli as well  
as the fortifications, are to be found at the junction of all the  
considerable rivers, in the most eligible positions for towns,  
and in the most extensive bodies of fertile land. Their num-  
ber exceeds perhaps three thousand ; the smallest not less than  
twenty feet in height, and one hundred in diameter at the base.  
Their great number, and the astonishing size of some of them,  
may be regarded as furnishing, with other circumstances, evi-  
dence of their antiquity. I have been sometimes induced to  
think that at the period when those mounds were construct-  
ed, there existed on the Mississippi, a population as nume-  
rous as that which once animated the borders of the Nile, or  
of the Euphrates, or of Mexico and Peru.  
  
IV. The most numerous, as well as the most considerable  
of these remains, are found precisely in the part of the country  
where the traces of a numerous population might be looked  
for, to wit, from the mouth of the Ohio (on the east side of the  
Mississippi) to the Illinois river, and on the west side from  
the St. Francis to the Missouri. I am perfectly satisfied that  
cities similar to those of ancient Mexico, of several hundred  
thousand souls, have existed in this part of the country. Nearly  
opposite St. Louis there are the traces of two such cities, in  
the distance of five miles, on the bank of the Cohokia, which

less than one hundred mounds, in two different groups ; one  
of the mounds falls little short of the Egyptian pyramid My-

this stupendous monument of antiquity should have been unno-

almost be considered a discovery, attracted no notice: and  
yet I stated it to be eight hundred paces in circumference (the  
exact size of the pyramid of Asychis) and one hundred feet  
in height. The mounds at Grave Creek and Marietta are of  
the second or third class. The mounds at St. Louis, at New  
Madrid, and at the commencement of Black River, are all  
larger than those of Marietta. The following is an enumera-  
tion of the most considerable mounds on the Mississippi and  
on the Ohio; the greater part I examined myself with such  
attention as the short time I had to spare would permit.  
  
. At Great Creek, below Wheeling.  
  
. At Pittsburgh.  
  
. At Marietta.  
  
. At Cincinnati.  
  
At New Madrid—one of them 350 feet diameter at the  
  
. Bois Brulie bottom, fifteen miles below St. Genevieve.  
At St. Genevieve.  
  
. Mouth of the Marameck.  
  
. St. Louis—one with two stages, another with three.  
  
10. Mouth of the Missouri.  
  
441. On the Cohokia river—in two groups.  
  
12. Twenty miles below—two groups also, but the mounds  
of a smaller size—on the back of a lake, formerly the bed of  
the river.  
  
13. Near Washington (M. T.) 146 feet in height.  
  
14. At Baton Rouge, and on the bayou Manchac—one of  
the mounds near the lake is chiefly composed of shells—the  
inhabitants have taken away great quantities of these for the  
purpose of making lime.  
  
15. The mound on Black River, of two stages, with a group  
around it.  
  
At each of these places there are groups of mounds; and  
at each there probably once existed a city. On the other con-  
siderable rivers which are tributary to the Ohio and Missis-  
sippi, in Kentucky, Tennessee, state of Ohio, Indiana Territo-  
ry, &amp;c. they are equally numerous. But the principal city

and center of population was between the Ohio, Mississippi,  
Missouri, and Jilinois. I have been informed thai in the plzins  
between the Arkansa and St. Francis, they are numerous and  
some very large. They resembie the Teocalli. in these impor-  
tant features, 1. In their positions the cardinal points are ob-  
served with considerable accuracy. 2. The larger mounds  
have several stages. 3. In every group there are two mounds  
much larger than the others. 4. The smaller mounds are  
placed around symmetrically. A closer examination would show  
a resemblance in other particulars. It is doubted by Humboldt  
whether advantage had not been taken of some natural rise,  
in the formation of the pyramid of Cholula; with respect to  
the mound of Cohokia, there can be no doubt, for it stands in  
the midst of alluvium, and there is no natural hill nearer than  
two miles.*  
  
Such are the appearances of antiquity in the western coun-  
try, which I consider as furnishing proof of an ancient and  
numerous population. The resemblance to those of New  
Spain would render probable the existence of the same arts  
and customs; perhaps of an intercourse. The distance from the  
large mound on Red River, to the nearest in New Spain, is not  
so great but that they might be considered as existing in the  
same country.  
  
From the description of the ldoratorios, as they are called,  
it appears highly probable that the mounds on the Mississippi  
were destined for the same purposes. Solis tells us, that every  
considerable place had a number of them, upon which a kind  
of tower was erected, and which gave rise to the belief of those  
who first visited the coast of New Spain, that they had seen  
cities with numerous steeples ;+ from which circumstance they  
bestowed upon it the name of their native country. The four

+ Mr. Robertson, who is disposed to lessen every thing American, and to  
treat with contempt unworthy of a philosopher, all their acts and advance-

great cities to which the general name of Mexico was given,  
contained two thousand of these Adoratorios or &#x27;Teocalli; at the  
first glance, this vast population, equal perhaps to London or  
Paris, appeared to be crowned with innumerable towers and  
steeples. Architecture was perhaps too much in its infancy  
to enable them to build to any great height, a mound was there-  
fore raised, and a building erected on the top. It was in this  
way the temple of Belus at Babylon was erected, and the  
Egyptian pyramids of the second class, which are solid, and  
probably the most ancient. Besides being places of adoration,  
the Teocalli also served as fortresses ; they were usually the  
last places, to which the inhabitants of the cities conquered by  
Cortez, resorted, after having been driven from every other  
quarter. They were enabled from the position, form, and  
the tower on the top, to defend themselves in these situations  
to great advantage. Placed from the bottom to the top of the  
mount, by gradations above each other, they appeared (as  
Solis in his animated style expresses it) to constitute “ a living  
hill ;” and at first, judging only from the experience of their  
own wars, they fancied themselves unassailable.  
  
From the oldest book extant, the bible, we see exemplified  
in numerous instances, the natural predilection for resorting to  
high-places, for the purpose of worship; this prevailed amongst  
all nations, and probably the first edifice dedicated to the  
Deity was an elevation of earth, the next step was the placing  
a temple on it, and finally churches and mosques were built  
with steeples. This having prevailed in all countries, may be  
considered as the dictate of nature. The most ancient temples  
of the Greeks were erected on artificial, or natural elevations  
of earth; at the present day, almost every part of Europe  
and Asia, exhibits these remains of tumuli, the rudest, though  
perhaps the most lasting of human works.* The mausoleum  
generally holds the next place to the temple; and, what is  
remarkable, all nations in their wars have made the last

stand in the edifices consecrated to their gods, and near to  
the tombs of their ancestors. The Adoratorios of New Spain,  
like all works of the kind, answered the three purposes, of  
the temple, the fortress, and the mausoleum. Can we enter-  
tain a doubt but that this was also the case with those of the  
Mississippi ? ,  
  
The antiquity of these mounds is certainly very great; this  
is not inferred from the growth of trees, which prove an an-  
tiquity of a few centuries, but from this simple reflection; a  
people capable of works requiring so much labour, must be  
numerous, and if numerous, somewhat advanced in the arts ;  
we might therefore look for works of stone or brick, the traces  
of which would remain for at least eight or ten centuries. The  
great mound of Cohokia, is evidently constructed with as much  
regularity as any of the Teocalli of New Spain, and was doubt-  
less chased with brick or stone, and crowned with buildings ;  
but of these no traces remain. Near the mound at St. Louis,  
there are a few decaying stones, but which may have been  
casually brought there. The pyramid of Papantla, in the  
northern part of the Intendency of Vera Cruz, unknown to  
the first conquerors, and discovered a few years ago, was still  
partly cased with bricks. We might be warranted in consider-  
ing the mounds of the Mississippi more ancient than the Teo-  
calli: a fact worthy of notice, although the stages are still  
plain in some of them, the gradations or steps have disap-  
peared, in the course of time the rains having washed them  
off. The pieces of obsidian or flint, are found in great quan-  
tities near them, as is the case with the Teocalli. Some might  
be startled if I should say that the mound of Cohokia is as  
ancient as those of Egypt! The Mexicans possessed but im-  
perfect traditions of the construction of their Teocalli; their  
traditions attribute them to the Toultees, or to the Olmees,  
who probably migrated from the Mississippi.  
  
Who will pretend to speak with certainty as to the antiquity  
of America—the races of men who have flourished and dis-  
appeared—of the thousand revolutions, which, like other parts  
of the globe, it has undergone? The philosophers of Europe,

with a narrowness and selfishness of mind, have endeavoured  
to depreciate every thing which relates to it. They have called  
it the New World, as though its formation was posterior to  
the rest of the habitable globe. A few facts suffice to repel  
this idea:—the antiquity of her mountains, the remains of vol-  
canoes, the alluvial tracts, the wearing away of cataracts, &amp;c.  
and the number of primitive languages, greater perhaps than  
in all the rest of the world besides.  
  
The use of letters, and the discovery of the mariner’s com-  
pass, the invention of gunpowder and of printing, have pro-  
duced incalculable changes in the old world. I question much  
whether before those periods, comparatively recent, there  
existed, or could exist, nations more civilised than the Mexi-  
cans, or Peruvians. In morals, the Greeks and Romans, in  
their most enlightened days, were not superior to the Mexi-  
cans. We are told that these people sacrificed human beings  
to their gods! did not the Romans sacrifice their unfortunate  
prisoners to their depraved and wicked pleasures, compelling  
them to kill each other? Was the sacrifice of Ephigenia,  
to obtain a favorable wind, an act of less barbarity than the  
sacrifices by the Mexicans of their prisoners on the altar of  
their gods? The Peruvians were exempt from these crimes  
—perhaps the mildest and most innocent people that ever  
lived, and in the arts as much advanced as were the ancient  
Persians or Egyptians ; and not only in the arts, but even in the  
sciences. Was ever any work of the old world superior to  
the two roads from Quito to Cusco?  
  
Pardon me, sir, for troubling you with this long, and per-  
haps tiresome letter, dictated probably by the vanity of per-  
sonally communicating my crude theories to one who holds  
so distinguished a place in that temple of science which be-  
Jongs to every age and every country.

I am, Sir,

Humble servant,

Baton Rouge, July 25, 1813.  
Sir,  
  
From a knowledge that research into the history of the  
primitive inhabitants of America, is one of your favourite  
amusements, I take the liberty of making this communication.  
My attention to the subject, was first awakened on reading,  
wher a boy, the observations contained in .the “ Notes on  
Virginia,” and it has become, with me, a favourite theme of  
speculation. I often visited the monnd, and other remains of  
Indian antiquity in the neighbourhood of Pittsburgh, my native  
town, attracted by a pleasing interest, of which I scarcely knew  
the cause, and afterwards read, and heard with delight, what-  
ever related to these monuments of the first, or rather earlier,  
inhabitants of my native country. Since the year 1810 (with-  
out previously intending it) I have visited almost every thing  
of this kind, worthy of note on the Ohio and Mississippi ; and  
from examination and reflection, something like hypothesis.  
has taken the place of the vague wanderings of fancy. The  
following is a sketch of the result of those observations.  
  
I. Throughout, what is denominated by Volney, the valley  
of the Mississippi, there exist the traces of a population far

beyond what this extensive and fertile portion of the continent,  
  
is supposed to have possessed: greater, perhaps, than could  
  
be supported of the present white inhabitants, even with the  
careful agriculture practised in the most populous parts of  
  
Europe. The reason of this, is to be found in the peculiar  
  
manners of the inhabitants by whom it was formerly occupied;  
  
like those of Mexico, their agriculture had for its only object  
their own sustenance; no surplus was demanded for com-  
merce with foreign nations, and no part of the soil, susceptible  
of culture, was devoted to pasturage ; yet, extensive forests  
filled with wild animals would still remain. The aggregate  
  
; population of the country might be less, but that of particular  
  
f districts much greater. We must, in this way, account for the  
  
astonishing population of the vale of Mexico, when first known  
to the Spaniards ; perhaps equal to any district of the same  
extent of climate.* The astonishing population of Owyhee,  
and Otaheite, must be accounted for in the same way. There  
are certainly many districts on the Ohio and Mississippi equally  
favourable to a numerous population. When I contemplated  
  
! the beauty and fertility of those spots, I could scarcely believe  
  
) it possible, that they should never have supported a numerous  
  
: population; such a fact would form an exception to what has  
  
it usually occurred, in every other part of the globe.  
  
‘ II. In the valley of the Mississippi, there are discovered the  
traces of two distinct races of people, or periods of popula-  
tion, one much more ancient than the other. The traces of  
  
i the last are the most numerous, but mark a population less  
  
advanced in civilization ; in fact, they belong to the same race  
  
that existed in the country when the French and English effect-  
ed their settlements on this part of the continent: but since the  
intercourse of these people with the whites, and their asto-  
nishing diminution in numbers, many of their customs have  
fallen into disuse. It is not more than a hundred and twenty  
years, since the character of the population, which left the  
traces of the second period, underwent a change. The ap

pearances of fortifications, of which so much has been said,  
and which have been attributed to a colony of Welch, are  
nothing more than the traces of pallisadoed towns or villages.  
The first travellers mention this custom of surrounding their  
towns with pallisades; the earth was thrown up a few feet,  
and pickets placed on the top. I have seen old volumes in  
which they are represented in the engravings.* The Arikara  
and Mandan villages are still fortified in this way. The traces  
of these are astonishingly numerous in the western country ;  
I should not exaggerate if I were to say that five thousand  
might be found. Some of them inclose more than an hundred  
acres. From some cause or other (and we know that there  
are enough which might suffice to effect it) the population had  
been astonishingly diminished immediately before we became  
acquainted with them; and yet Charlevoix mentions a town  
of the Mascutin tribe (at present incorporated with the Kick-  
apoos) containing a thousand families! The barrows, or gen-  
eral receptacles of the dead, such as examined by yourself,  
may be classed with the pallisadoed towns, though they are  
much more numerous; they are, in fact, to be found in almost  
every cornfield in the western country. The tumuli or mounds,  
are often met with, where there is no appearance of pallisadoed  
villages or fortifications, or of barrows.  
  
II. The first and more ancient period, is marked by those  
extraordinary tumuli or mounds. 1 have reason to believe that  
their antiquity is very great. The oldest Indians have no tra-  
dition as to their authors, or the purposes for which they were  
originally intended ; yet they were formerly, I might almost  
say instinctively, in the habit of using them for one of the

work by Lafitau, a jesuit, which I met with at New Orleans.  
contains a curious plate in which one of these mounds forti-  
fied by pallisades on the top, and large beams extending to  
the bottom, is assaulted by enemies. These tumuli as well  
as the fortifications, are to be found at the junction of all the  
considerable rivers, in the most eligible positions for towns,  
and in the most extensive bodies of fertile land. Their num-  
ber exceeds perhaps three thousand ; the smallest not less than  
twenty feet in height, and one hundred in diameter at the base.  
Their great number, and the astonishing size of some of them,  
may be regarded as furnishing, with other circumstances, evi-  
dence of their antiquity. I have been sometimes induced to  
think that at the period when those mounds were construct-  
ed, there existed on the Mississippi, a population as nume-  
rous as that which once animated the borders of the Nile, or  
of the Euphrates, or of Mexico and Peru.  
  
IV. The most numerous, as well as the most considerable  
of these remains, are found precisely in the part of the country  
where the traces of a numerous population might be looked  
for, to wit, from the mouth of the Ohio (on the east side of the  
Mississippi) to the Illinois river, and on the west side from  
the St. Francis to the Missouri. I am perfectly satisfied that  
cities similar to those of ancient Mezico, of several hundred  
thousand souls, have existed in this part of the country. Nearly  
opposite St. Louis there are the traces of two such cities, in  
the distance of five miles, on the bank of the Cohokia, which  
crosses the American bottom at this place.* There are not  
less than one hundred mounds, in two different groups; one  
of the mounds falls little short of the Egyptian pyramid My-  
cerius. When I examined it in 1814, I was astonished that  
this stupendous monument of antiquity should have been unno-  
ticed by any traveller: I afterwards published an account in  
the newspapers at St. Louis, detailing its dimensions, descri-  
bing its form, position, &amp;c. but this, which I thought might

almost be considered a discovery, attracted no notice: and  
yet I stated it to be eight hundred paces in circumference (the  
exact size of the pyramid of Asychis) and one hundred feet  
in height. The mounds at Grave Creek and Marietta are of  
the second or third class. The mounds at St. Louis, at New  
Madrid, and at the commencement of Black River, are all  
larger than those of Marietta. The following is an enumera-  
tion of the most considerable mounds on the Mississippi and  
on the Ohio; the greater part I examined myself with such  
attention as the short time I had to spare would permit.  
  
4. At Great Creek, below Wheeling.  
  
2. At Pittsburgh.  
  
3. At Marietta.  
  
4. At Cincinnati.  
  
5. At New Madrid—one of them 350 feet diameter at the  
base.  
  
6. Bois Brulie bottom, fifteen miles below St. Genevieve.  
  
7. At St. Genevieve.  
  
8. Mouth of the Marameck.  
  
9. St. Louis—one with two stages, another with three.  
  
40. Mouth of the Missouri.  
  
441. On the Cohokia river—in two groups.  
  
12. Twenty miles below—two groups also, but the mounds  
of a smaller size—on the back of a lake, formerly the bed of  
the river.  
  
13. Near Washington (M. T.) 146 feet in height.  
  
14. At Baton Rouge, and on the bayou Manchac—one of  
the mounds near the lake is chiefly composed of shells—the  
inhabitants have taken away great quantities of these for the  
purpose of making lime.  
  
15. The mound on Black River, of two stages, with a group  
around it.  
  
At each of these places there are groups of mounds; and  
at each there probably once existed a city. On the other con-  
siderable rivers which are tributary to the Ohio and Missis-  
sippi, in Kentucky, Tennessee, state of Ohio, Indiana Territo-  
ry, &amp;c. they are equally numerous. But the principal city

and center of population was between the Ohio, Mississippi,  
Missouri, and Jilinois. I have been informed thai in the plains  
between the Arkansa and St. Francis, they are numerous and  
some very large. They resemble the Teocalli. in these impor-  
tant features, 1. In their positions the cardinal points are ob-  
served with considerable accuracy. 2. The larger mounds  
have several stages. 3. In every group there are two mounds  
much larger than the others. 4. The smaller mounds are  
placed around symmetrically. A closer examination would show  
a resemblance in other particulars. It is doubted by Humboldt  
whether advantage had not been taken of some natural rise,  
in the formation of the pyramid of Cholula; with respect to  
the mound of Cohokia, there can be no doubt, for it stands in  
the midst of alluvium, and there is no natural hill nearer than  
two miles.*  
  
Such are the appearances of antiquity in the western coun-  
try, which I consider as furnishing proof of an ancient and  
numerous population. The resemblance to those of New  
Spain would render probable the existence of the same arts  
and customs; perhaps of an intercourse. The distance from the  
large mound on Red River, to the nearest in New Spain, is not  
so great but that they might be considered as existing in the  
same country.  
  
From the description of the Adoratorios, as they are called,  
it appears highly probable that the mounds on the Mississippi  
were destined for the same purposes. Solis tells us, that every  
considerable place had a number of them, upon which a kind  
of tower was erected, and which gave rise to the belief of those  
who first visited the coast of New Spain, that they had seen  
cities with numerous steeples ;+ from which circumstance they  
bestowed upon it the name of their native country. The four

+ Mr. Robertson, who is disposed to lessen every thing American, and to  
treat with contempt unworthy of a philosopher, all their acts and advance-

great cities to which the general name of Mexico was given,  
contained two thousand of these Adoratorios or &#x27;Teocalli; at the  
first glance, this vast population, equal perhaps to London or  
Paris, appeared to be crowned with innumerable towers and  
steeples. Architecture was perhaps too much in its infancy  
to enable them to build to any great height, a mound was there-  
fore raised, and a building erected on the top. It was in this  
way the temple of Belus at Babylon was erected, and the  
Egyptian pyramids of the second class, which are solid, and  
probably the most ancient. Besides being places of adoration,  
the Teocalli also served as fortresses ; they were usually the  
last places, to which the inhabitants of the cities conquered by  
Cortez, resorted, after having been driven from every other  
quarter. They were enabled from the position, form, and  
the tower on the top; to defend themselves in these situations  
to great advantage. Placed from the bottom to the top of the  
mount, by gradations above each other, they appeared (as  
Solis in his animated style expresses it) to constitute “a living  
hill ;” and at first, judging only from the experience of their  
own wars, they fancied themselves unassailable.  
  
From the oldest book extant, the bible, we see exemplified  
in numerous instances, the natural predilection for resorting to  
high-places, for the purpose of worship; this prevailed amongst  
all nations, and probably the first edifice dedicated to the  
Deity was an elevation of earth, the next step was the placing  
a temple on it, and finally churches and mosques were built  
with steeples. This having prevailed in all countries, may be  
considered as the dictate of nature. The most ancient temples  
of the Greeks were erected on artificial, or natural elevations  
of earth; at the present day, almost every part of Europe  
and Asia, exhibits these remains of tumuli, the rudest, though  
perhaps the most lasting of human works.* The mausoleum  
generally holds the next place to the temple; and, what is  
remarkable, all nations in their wars have made the last

stand in the edifices consecrated to their gods, and near to  
the tombs of their ancestors. The Adoratorios of New Spain,  
like all works of the kind, answered the three purposes, of  
the temple, the fortress, and the mausoleum. Can we enter-  
tain a doubt but that this was also the case with those of the  
Mississippi?  
  
The antiquity of these mounds is certainly very great; this  
is not inferred from the growth of trees, which prove an an-  
tiquity of a few centuries, but from this simple reflection; a  
people capable of works requiring so much labour, must be  
numerous, and if numerous, somewhat advanced in the arts ;  
we might therefore look for works of stone or brick, the traces  
of which would remain for at least eight or ten centuries. The  
great mound of Cohokia, is evidently constructed with as much  
regularity as any of the Teocalli of New Spain, and was doubt-  
less chased with brick or stone, and crowned with buildings ;  
but of these no traces remain. Near the mound at St. Louis,  
there are a few decaying stones, but which may have been  
casually brought there. The pyramid of Papantla, in the  
northern part of the Intendency of Vera Cruz, unknown to  
the first conquerors, and discovered a few years ago, was still  
partly cased with bricks. We might be warranted in consider-  
ing the mounds of the Mississippi more ancient than the Teo-  
calli: a fact worthy of notice, although the stages are still  
plain in some of them, the gradations or steps have disap-  
peared, in the course of time the rains having washed them  
off. The pieces of obsidian or flint, are found in great quan-  
tities near them, as is the case with the Teocalli. Some might  
be startled if I should say that the mound of Cohokia is as  
ancient as those of Egypt! The Mexicans possessed but im-  
perfect traditions of the construction of their Teocalli; their  
traditions attribute them to the Toultees, or to the Olmees,  
who probably migrated from the Mississippi.  
  
Who will pretend to speak with certainty as to the antiquity  
of America—the races of men who have flourished and dis-  
appeared—of the thousand revolutions, which, like other parts  
of the globe, it has undergone? The philosophers of Europe,

with a narrowness and selfishness of mind, have endeavoured  
to depreciate every thing which relates to it. They have called  
it the New World, as though its formation was posterior to  
the rest of the habitable globe. A few facts suffice to repel  
this idea:—the antiquity of her mountains, the remains of vol-  
canoes, the alluvial tracts, the wearing away of cataracts, &amp;c.  
and the number of primitive languages, greater perhaps than  
in all the rest of the world besides.  
  
The use of letters, and the discovery of the mariner’s com-  
pass, the invention of gunpowder and of printing, have pro-  
duced incalculable changes in the old world. I question much  
whether before those periods, comparatively recent, there  
existed, or could exist, nations more civilised than the Mexi-  
cans, or Peruvians. In morals, the Greeks and Romans, in  
their most enlightened days, were not superior to the Mexi-  
cans. We are told that these people sacrificed human beings  
to their gods! did not the Romans sacrifice their unfortunate  
prisoners to their depraved and wicked pleasures, compelling  
them to kill each other? Was the sacrifice of Ephigenia,  
to obtain a favorable wind, an act of less barbarity than the  
sacrifices by the Mexicans of their prisoners on the altar of  
their gods? The Peruvians were exempt from these crimes  
—perhaps the mildest and most innocent people that ever  
lived, and in the arts as much advanced as were the ancient  
Persians or Egyptians ; and not only in the arts, but even in the  
sciences. Was ever any work of the old world superior to  
the two roads from Quito to Cusco?  
  
Pardon me, sir, for troubling you with this long, and per-  
haps tiresome letter, dictated probably by the vanity of per-  
sonally communicating my crude theories to one who holds  
so distinguished a place in that temple of science which be-  
Jongs to every age and every country.  
  
With sentiments of the highest respect,  
I am, Sir,  
Your most obedient,  
Humble servant,

| Baion Rouge, July 25, 1813.  
  
_ porterkbery a knowledge that research into the history of the  
  
primitive inhabitants of America, is one of your favourite  
amusements, I take the liberty of making this communication. My  
attention to the subject, was first awakened on reading, when a boy,  
the observations contained in the ‘ Notes on Virginia,’ and it has  
become, with me, a favourite theme of speculation. I often visited  
the mound, and other remains of Indian antiquity in the neighbour-  
hood of Pittsburgh, my native town, attracted by a pleasing inter-  
est, of which I scarcely knew the cause, and afterwards read, and  
heard with delight, whatever related to these monuments of the  
first, or rather earlier, inhabitants of my native country. Since the  
year 1810 (without previously intending it) I have visited almost  
every thing of this kind, worthy of note on the Ohio and Missis-  
sippi; and from examination and reflection, something like hypo-  
thesis, has taken the place of the vague wanderings of fancy. The  
following is a sketch of the result of those observations.  
  
I. Throughout, what is denominated by Volney, the valley of the  
Mississippi, there exist the traces of a population far beyond what  
this extensive and fertile portion of the continent, is supposed to  
have possessed: greater, perhaps, than could be supported of the  
present white inhabitants, even with the careful agriculture practi-  
sed in the most populous parts of Europe. The reason of this, is  
to be found in the peculiar manners of the inhabitants by whom it  
was formerly occupied; like those of Mexico, their agriculture had  
for its only object their own sustenance; no surplus was demanded  
for commerce with foreign nations, and no part of the soil,: ..ep-  
tible of culture, was devoted to pasturage; yet, extensive forests  
filled with wild animals would still remain. The aggregate popu-  
lation of the country might be less, but that of particular districts  
  
much greater. We must, in this way, account for the astonishing  
population of the vale of Mexico. when first known to the Spaniards;  
perhaps equal to any district of the same extent of climate.* The  
astonishing population of Owyhee, and Otaheite, must be account-  
ed for in the same way. There are certainly many districts on  
the Ohio and Mississippi equally favourable to a numerous popu-  
lation. When I contemplated the beauty and fertility of those  
spots, I could scarcely believe it possible, that they should never  
have supported a numerous population; such a fact would form an  
exception to what has usually occurred, in every other part of the  
  
globe.  
II. In the valley of the Mississippi, there are discovered the

one much more ancient than the other. The traces of the last are  
the most numerous, but mark a population less advanced in civili-  
zation; in fact, thev belong to the same race that existed in the  
country when the French and English effected their settlements on  
this part of the continent: but since the intercourse of these people  
with the whites, and their astonishing diminution in numbers,  
many of their customs have fallen into disuse. It is not more than  
a hundred and twenty years, since the character of the population,  
which left the traces of the second period, underwent a change.  
The appearances of fortifications, of which so much has been said,  
and which have been attributed to a colony of Welch, are nothing  
more than the traces of pallisadoed towns or villages. The first  
travellers mention this custom of surrounding their towns with pal-  
lisades; the earth was thrown up a few feet, and pickets placed on  
the top. I have seen old volumes in which they are represented  
in the engravings.* The Arikara and Mandan villages are still  
fortified in this way. The traces of these are astonishingly nu-  
merous in the western country; I should not exaggerate if I were  
to say that five thousand might be found. Some of them inclose  
more than an hundred acres. From some cause or other (and we  
know that there are enough which might suffice to effect it) the  
population had been astonishingly diminished immediately before  
we became acquainted with them; and yet Charlevoix mentions a  
town of the Mascutin tribe (at present incorporated with the  
Kickapoos) containing a thousand families! The barrows, or gene-  
ral receptacles of the dead, such as examined by yourself, may be  
classed with the pallisadoed towns, though they are much more  
numerous; they are, in fact, to be found in almost every corn-field  
in the western country. The tumuli, or mounds, are often met  
with, where there is no appearance of pallisadoed villages or for-  
tifications, or of barrows.  
  
III. The first and more ancient period, is marked by those ex-  
traordinary tumuli or mounds. I have reason to believe that their  
antiquity is very great. The oldest Indians have no tradition as to  
their authors, or the purposes for which they were originally in-  
tended; yet they were formerly, I might almost say instinctive&#x27;y,  
in the habit of using them for one of the purposes for which they  
were at first designed, to wit, as places of defence. The old chief  
Du Coin, told Mr. Rice Jones that the mounds in the American  
bottom had been fortified by the Kaskaskias in their wars with the  
Iroquois. An old work by Lafitau, a jesuit, which I met with at  
New Orleans, contains a curious plate in which one of these mounds  
fortified by pallisades on the top, and large beams extending to the  
bottom, is assaulted by enemies. These tumuli as well as the for-  
tifications, are to be found at the junction of all the considerable  
rivers, in the most eligible positions for towns, and in the most ex-

tensive bodies of fertile land. Their number exceeds, perhaps,  
three thousand; the smallest not less than twenty feet in height,  
and one hundred in diameter at the base. Their great number, and  
the astonishing size of some of them, may be regarded as furnish-  
ing, with other circumstances, evidence of their antiquity. I have  
been sometimes induced to think, that at the period when those  
mounds were constructed, there existed on the Mississippi, a po-  
  
ulation as numerous as that which once animated the borders of  
the Nile, or of the Euphrates, or of Mexico and Peru.  
  
IV. The most numerous, as well as the most considerable of  
these remains, are found precisely in the part of the country where  
the traces of a numerous population might be looked for, to wit,  
from the mouth of the Ohio (on the east side of the Mississippi)  
to the Illinois river, and on the west side from the St. Francis to  
the Missouri. I am perfectly satisfied that cities similar to those  
of ancient Mexico, of several hundred thousand souls, have existed  
in this part of the country. Nearly opposite St. Louis there are  
the traces of two such cities, in the distance of five miles, on the  
bank of the Cohokia, which crosses the American bottom at this  
place.* There are not less than one hundred mounds, in two differ-  
ent groups; one of the mounds falls little short of the Egyptian  
  
yramid Mycerius. When I examined it, in 1811, I was astonish-  
ed that this stupendous monument of antiquity should have been  
unnoticed by any traveller: I afterwards published an account in the  
newspapers at St. Louis, detailing its dimensions, describing its  
form, position, &amp;c. but this, which I thought might almost be con-  
sidered a discovery, attracted no notice: and yet I stated it to be  
eight hundred paces in circumference (the exact size of the pyra-  
mid of Asychis) and one hundred feet in height. The mounds at  
Grave Creek and Marietta are of the second or third class. The  
mounds at St. Louis, at New Madrid, and at the commencement  
of Black River, are all larger than those of Marietta. The follow-  
ing is an enumeration of the most considerable mounds on the  
Mississippi and on the Ohio; the greater part I examined myself  
  
_with such attention as the short time I had to spare would permit.  
  
1. At Great Creek, below Wheeling.  
2. At Pittsburgh.  
3. At Marietta.  
  
4. At Cincinnati.  
5. At New Madrid—one of them 350 feet.diameter at the base.  
  
6. Bois Brulie bottom, fifteen miles below St. Genevieve.  
7. At St. Genevieve.  
  
8. Mouth of the Marameck.  
  
9. St. Louis—one with two stages, another with three.  
10. Mouth of the Missouri.  
  
11. On the Cohokia river—in two groups.

12. Twenty miles below—two groups also, but the mounds of a  
smaller size—on the back of a lake, formerly the bed of the river.  
  
13. Near Washington (M. T.) 146 feet in height.  
  
14. At Baton Rouge, and on the bayou Manchac—one of the  
mounds near the lake is chiefly composed of shells—the inhabitants  
er taken away great quantities of these for the purpose of making  
  
ime.  
  
15. The mound on Black River, of two stages, with a group  
around it.  
  
At each of these places there are groups of mounds; and at each  
there probably once existed a city. On the other considerable  
rivers which are tributary to the Ohio and Mississippi, in Ken-  
tucky, Tennessee, state of Ohio, Indiana territory, &amp;c. they are  
equally numerous. But the principal city and center of population  
was between the Ohio, Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois. I have  
been informed that in the plains between the Arkansa and St. Fran-  
cis, they are numerous and some very large. They resemble the  
Teocalli, in these important features, 1. In their positions the car-  
dinal points are observed with considerable accuracy. 2. The larger  
mounds have several stages. 3. In every group there are two mounds  
much larger than the others. 4. The smaller mounds are placed  
around symmetrically. A closer examination would show a re-  
semblance in other particulars. It is doubted by Humboldt whe-  
ther advantage had not been taken of some natural rise, in the for-  
mation of the pyramid of Cholula; with respect to the mound of  
Cohokia, there can be no doubt, for it stands in the midst of allu-  
vium, and there is no natural hill nearer than two miles.* &#x27;  
  
Such are the appearances of antiquity in the western country,  
which I consider as furnishing proof of an ancient and numerous  
population. The resemblance to those of New Spain would render  
probable the existence of the same arts and customs; perhaps of an  
intercourse. The distance from the large mound on Red River,  
to the nearest in New Spain, is not so great but that they might be  
considered as existing in the same country.  
  
From the description of the Adoratorios, as they are called, it  
appears highly probable that the mounds on the Mississippi were  
destined for the same purposes. Solis tells us, that every consi-  
derable place had a number of them, upon which a kind of tower  
was erected, and which gave rise to the belief pf those who first  
visited the coast of New Spain, that they had seen cities with nu-  
merous steeples;+ from which circumstance they bestowed upon it  
the name of their native country. The four great cities to which  
the general name of Mexico was given, contained two thousand of  
these Adoratorios or Teocalli; at the first glance, this vast popula

330 On the Population and Tumuli of the  
  
tion, equal perhaps to London or Paris, appeared to be crowned  
with innumerable towers and steeples. Architecture was, perhaps,  
too much in its infancy to enable them to build to any great height,  
a mound was therefore raised, and a building erected on the top.  
It was in this way the temple of Belus at Babylon was erected,  
and the Egyptian pyramids of the second class, which are solid, and  
probably the most ancient. Besides being places of adoration, the  
Teocalli also served as fortresses; they were usually the last places  
to which the inhabitants of the cities conquered by Cortez resort-  
ed, after having been driven from every other quarter. They were  
enabled from the position, form, and the tower on the top, to de-  
fend themselves in these situations to great advantage. Placed  
from the bottom to the top of the mount, by gradations above each  
other, they appeared (as Solis in his animated style expresses it)  
to constitute ‘a living hill;’ and, at first, judging only from the ex-  
perience of their own wars, they fancied themselves unassailable.  
  
From the oldest book extant, the Bible, we see exemplified, in  
numerous instances, the natural predilection for resorting to high-  
places, for the purpose of worship; this prevailed amongst all na-  
tions, and probably the first edifice dedicated to the Deity was an  
elevation of earth, the next step was the placing a temple on it, and  
finally churches and mosques were built with steeples. This hav-  
ing prevailed in all countries, may be considered as the dictate of  
nature. The most ancient temples of the Greeks were erected on  
artificial, or natural elevations of earth; at the present day, almost  
every part of Europe and Asia, exhibits these remains of tumuli,  
the rudest, though perhaps the most lasting of human works.*  
The mausoleum generally holds the next place to the temple; and,  
what is remarkable, all nations in their wars have made the last  
stand in the edifices consecrated to their gods, and near to the tombs  
of their ancestors. The Adoratorios of New Spain, like all works  
of the kind, answered the three purposes, of the temple, the for-  
tress, and the mausoleum. Can we entertain a doubt but that this  
was also the case with those of the Mississippi?  
  
The antiquity of these mounds is certainly very great; this is  
not inferred from the growth of trees, which prove an antiquity of  
a few centuries, but from this simple reflection; a people capable of  
works requiring so much labour, must be numerous, and if numer-  
ous, somewhat advanced in the arts; we might therefore look for  
works of stone or brick, the traces of which would remain for at  
least eight or ten centuries. The great mound of Cohokia, is evi-  
dently constructed with as much regularity as any of the Teocalli  
of New Spain, and was doubtless cased with brick or stone, and  
crowned with buildings; but of these no traces remain. Near the  
mound at St. Louis, there are a few decaying stones, but which  
may have been casually brought there. The pyramid of Papantla,  
in the northern part of the Intendancy of Vera Cruz, unknown to  
the first conquerors, and discovered a few years ago, was still partly

eased with bricks. We might be warranted in considering the  
mounds of the Mississippi more ancient than the Teocalli: a fact  
worthy of notice, although the stages are still plain in some of them,  
the gradations or steps have disappeared, in the course of time the  
rains having washed them off. ‘The pieces of obsidian or flint, are  
found in great quantities near them, as is the case with the Teo-  
calli. Some might be startled if I should say that the mound of  
Cohokia is as ancient as those of Egypt! The Mexicans possessed  
but imperfect traditions of the construction of their Teocalli; their  
traditions attribute them to the Toultees, or to the Olmees, who  
probably migrated from the Mississippi.  
  
Who will pretend to speak with certainty as to the antiquity of  
America—the races of men who have flourished and disappeared—  
of the thousand revolutions, which, like other parts of the globe, it  
has undergone? ‘The philosophers of Europe, with a narrowness  
and selfishness of mind, have endeavoured to depreciate every thing  
which relates to it. They have called it the New World, as though  
its formation was posterior to the rest of the habitable globe. A  
few facts suffice to repel this idea:—the antiquity of her mountains,  
the remains of volcanoes, the alluvial tracts, the wearing away of  
cataracts, &amp;c. and the number of primitive languages, greater per-  
haps than in all the rest of the world besides.  
  
The use of letters, and the discovery of the mariner’s compass,  
the invention of gunpowder and of printing, have produced incal-  
culable changes in the old world. I question much whether before  
those periods, comparatively receut, there existed, or could exist,  
nations more civilized than the Mexicans, or Peruvians. In morals,  
the Greeks and Romans, in their most enlightened days, were not  
superior to the Mexicans. We are told that these people sacrificed  
human beings to their gods! did not the Romans sacrifice their un-  
fortunate prisoners to their depraved and wicked pleasures, com-  
pelling them to kill each other? Was the sacrifice of Ephigenia, to  
obtain a favourable wind, an act of less barbarity than the sacri-  
fices by the Mexicans of their prisoners on the altar of their gods?  
The Peruvians were exempt from these crimes—perhaps the mild-  
est and most innocent people that ever lived, and in the arts as  
much advanced as were the ancient Persians or Egyptians; and  
not only in the arts, but even in the sciences. Was ever any work  
of the old world superior to the two roads from Quito to Cusco  
  
Pardon me, sir, for troubling you with this long, and perhaps  
tiresome letter, dictated probably by the vanity of personally com-  
municating my crude theories to one who holds so distinguished a  
place in that temple of science which belongs to every age and every  
country.  
  
With sentiments of the highest respect,  
I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,

yhundred and twenty years since the character of  
  
the population, which left the traces of the second  
neriod, underwent a change. The appearances of  
fortifications, of which so much has been said, and  
which have been attributed to colony of Welch,  
are nothing more than the traces of pallisadoed  
towns or villages. The first travellers mention this  
custom of surrounding their towns with pallisades;  
the earth was thrown up a few feet, and pickets  
placed on the top. I have seen old volumes in  
which they are represented in the engravings.*  
The Arikara and Mandan villages are still fortified  
in this way. The traces of these are astonishingly  
hamerous in ihe western country; I should not  
exaggerate if I were to say that five thousand might  
be found. Some of them inclose more than an  
hundred acres. From some cause or other (and  
we know that there are enough which might  
suffice to effect it) the population had been as-  
tonishingly diminished immediately before we be-  
came acquainted with them; and yet Coarlevoix  
mentions a town of the Mascutin tribe (at present  
incorporated with the Kickapoos) contaiing @

ceptacles of the dead, such as ¢xamined by your.

though they are much more numerous; they are,  
in fact, to be found in almost every corn field“in

possessed: greater, perhaps, than could be suppo=t-  
ed of the present white inhabitants, even with the  
  
careful agriculture practised in the most populous;  
parts of Europe.—The reason of this is to be found |  
in the peculiar manners of the inhabitants by whom|  
jt was formerly occupied; like these of Mexico, |  
  
their agriculture had for its only object their own  
sustenance; no surplus was demanded for com-  
merce with foreign nations, and no part of the soil,  
  
susceptible of culture, was devoted to pasturage; |  
  
yet extensive forests filled with wild animals would  
still remain. The aggregate population of the  
country might be less, but that of particular dis  
tricts much greater. We must, in this way, ac-  
count for the astonishing population of the vale  
  
of Mexico, when first known to the Spaniards; per  
  
haps equal to any district of the same extent of  
climate.* The astonishing population of Owyhee  
and Otaheite, must be accounted for in the same  
way.—There are certainly many districts on the  
Ohio and Mississippi equally favorable to a numer.  
ous population. When I contemplated the beauty  
and fertility of those spots, I could scarcely believe  
it possible, that they should never have supported  
a numerous pupulation; such a fact would form an  
exception to what has usually occurred, in every  
other part of the globe.  
  
2 In the vallev of the Mississippi, there are  
discovered the traces of two distinct races of peo  
ple, or periods of population, one much more  
ancient than the other. The traces of the last are  
the most numerous, but mark a population less  
advanced in civilization; in fact they belong to the  
same race that existed in the country when the  
French and English effected their settlements on  
this part of the continent: but since the i tercourse  
of these people with the whites, and their as onish-  
ing diminution in numbers, many of their customs  
have failen into disuse. It is not more than a

3 The first and more ancient period is marked  
T have  
reason to believe that their antiquity is very crest.  
The oldest Indians have no tradiiion as to their  
authors, or the purposes for which they were  
‘originally intended; yet they were formerly, f  
might almost say instinctiveiy, in the habit of  
jusing them for one of the purposes for which they  
| were at first designed, to wit, as places of defence.  
|The old chief Du Coin told Mr. Rice Jones that  
|the mounds in the American bottom had been  
fortified by the Kaskaskias in their wars with the  
frogunis, As old work by Lafitau, a jesuit, which  
I met with at New-Orleans, contains a curious plate  
in which one of these mounds, fortified by pallisades  
on the top, and large beams extefiding to the bot-  
tom, is assaulted by enemies. These tumuli as  
well as fortifications, are to be found at the junction  
of all the considerable rivers, in the most eligible  
positions for towns, and in the most extensive  
bodies of feriile land. Their Number exceeds,  
perhaps, three thousand; the smallest not less than  
twenty feet in height, and one hundred in diameter  
at the base.--Their great number, and the astonish.  
ing size of some of them, may be regarded as fur  
nishing, with other circumstances, evidence of their  
antiquity. I have been some times induced to  
think, that at the period when those mounds were  
cousiructed, there existed on the Mississippi, a  
population as numerous as that which once animat-  
ed the borders of the Nile, or of Euphrates, or of  
Mexico and Pcru.

siderable of these remains, are found precisely in

newspapers at St. Louis, detailing its dimensions, |  
describing its form, postition, &amp;c. but this, which

hundred paces in circumference (the exact size of |  
the pyramid of Asychis) and one hundred feet in  
height.—The mounds at Grave creek and Marietta  
are of the second or third class. Yhe mounds at  
St. Louis, at New Madrid, and at the commence-  
ment of Black river, are all larger than those of:  
Marietta. The following is an enumeration of the  
most considerable mounds on the Mississippi and  
on the Ohio; the greater part I examined myself!  
with such attention as the short time I had to spare |  
would permit:  
  
1, At Grest creck, below Wheeling. 2 At Pitts-  
burgh. 3. At Marietta. 4. At Cincinnati. 5. At  
New Madrid—one of thein 350 feet diameter at  
the base. 6. Bois Brulie bottom, 15 miles telow  
St. Genevieve. 7. At St. Genevieve. 8. Mouth of  
the Marameck. 9. Si. Louis—one with 2 stages,  
another with 3. 10. Mouth of the Missouri. 11. On  
the Cohckia river—in 2 groups. 12. Twenty miles  
below—2 groups also, but the mounds of a smaller  
size—on the back of a lake, furmerly the bed of  
the river. 13. Near Washington (M. T.) 146 feet  
in height. 14. At Baton Rouge, and on the bayou  
Manchac—one of the mounds near the lake is  
chiefly. composed of shells; the inhabitants have  
taken away great quantities of these for the pur-  
pose pf making lime. 15. The mound on Black  
river, of two stages, with a group around it.  
  
At each of these places there are groups of  
mounds; and at each there probably once existed  
acity. On the other considerable rivers which are  
tributary to the Ohio and Mississippi in Kentucky,  
Tennessee, siate of Ohio, Indiana territory, &amp;c.  
they are equally numerous, But the principal city  
and centre of population was between the Ohio.

‘of antiquity should have been unnoticed by any;mounds on the Mississippi were destined for the  
  
same purposes. Solis tells us, that every consider.  
able place had a number of them, upon which a  
kind of tower was erecte’, and which gave rise to  
the belief of those who first visited the coast of  
New Spain, tiiat they had been Cities with numerous  
steepies;t from which circumstance they bestowed  
upon it the name of their Rative country. The four  
great cities to which the general name of Mexico  
was given, contained two thousand of these Adora.  
torios or Teocalli; at the first glance, this vast  
population, equal perhaps to London or Paris, ap-  
peared to be crowned with innumerable towers and  
steeples. Architecture was perhaps too much in  
its infancy to enable them to build to any great  
height—a mound was therefore raised, and a build-  
ing erected onthetop. Ii was in this way the tem.  
ple of Belus at Babylon was erected, and Egyptian  
pyramic . of the second class, which are solid, and  
probably the most ancient. Besides being places  
of adoration, the Teccalli also served as fortresses;  
they were usuaily the last places to which the  
inhabitants of the cities conquered by Cortez re-  
sorted, after having been driven from every other  
quarter. They were enabled from the position,  
form, and the tower on the top, to defend them.  
selves in these situations to great advantage.—  
Placed from the bottom to the top of the mount,  
by gradations above each other, they appeared (as  
Solis in his animated style expresses it) to con-  
stitute a living hill; and, at first, judging only from  
the experience of their own wars, they fancied  
themselves unassailable.  
  
From the oldest book extant, the bible, we see  
exemplified, in numerous instances, the natural  
predilection for resorting to high places, for the  
purpose of worship; this prevailed amongst all na-  
tions, and probably the first edifice dedicated to  
the Deity was an elevation of earth, the next  
  
  
  
ae was the placing a temple on it, and finally  
  
churches and mosques were built witb steeples.

temple; snd, what is remarkable, all nations 19  
sheir wars have made the last stand in the edifices  
consecrated to their gods, and near to the tontbs  
of their ancestors. The Adoratorios of New Spain,  
like all works of the kind, answered the three  
  
urposes, of the temple, the fortress, and the  
inausoleum, Can we entertain a doubt but that  
this was also the c»se with those of the Mississippi ?  
  
The antiquity of these mounds is certainly very  
  
reat; this is not inferred from the growth of trees,  
which prove an antiquity of a few centuries, but  
from this simple reflection; a people capable of  
works requiring so much labor must be numerous,  
and if numerous, somewhat advanced in the arts; we  
might therefore look for works of stone or brick,  
the traces of which would remain for at least eiglit  
er ten centuries. The great mound of Cohokia,  
is evidently constructed with as much regularity  
as any of the Teocalli of New Spain, and was  
doubtless cased with brick or stone, and crowned  
with buildings; but of these no traces remain.  
Near the mound ai St. Louis, there are a few decay-  
ing stones, but which may have been casually  
brought there. Fhe pyramid of Papantla, in the  
northern part of the Intendancy of Vera Cruz, un-  
  
known to the first conquerors, and discovered .aj  
  
few years ago, was still partly cased with bricks.  
We might be warranted in considering the mounds  
of the Mississippi more ancient than the Teocalli,  
a fact worthy of notice, although the stages are  
still plain in some of them, the gradations or steps  
have disappeared, in the course of time the rains  
having washed them off. The pieces of obsidan  
or fliat, are found in great quantities near them, as  
is the case with the Teocalli. Some might be  
startled if { should aay that the mound of Cohokia  
is as ancient as those of Egypt! The Mexicans  
possessed but imperfect traditions of the construc-  
tion of their Teocalli;. their traditions attribute  
them to the Toultees, or to the Olmees, who proba-  
bly migrated from the Mississippi.  
  
Who will pretend to speak with certainty as to  
the antiquity of America—the races of men who  
have flourished and disappeared—of the thousand  
revolutions which, like other parts of the globe,  
ithas undergone? The philosophers of Europe,  
with a narrowness and selfishness of mind, have  
endeavored to depreciate every thing which relates  
to it. They have called it the new world, as

Baron Rove, July 25, 18135.—Sir: From a  
  
knowledge that, research into the history of the  
  
primitive inhabitants of America, is one of your fa-  
vorite amusements, I take the liberty of making  
this communication. My attention to the subject,  
was first awakened on reading, when a boy, the ob-  
servations contained in the “ Notes on Virginia,”  
and it has become, with me, a favorite theme of  
speculation. I often visited the mound, and other  
remains of Incian antiquity in the neighbourhood  
of Pittsburg, my native town, attracted by a pleas-  
ing interest, of which I scarcely knew the cause,  
and afterwards read, and heard with delight, what-  
ever related to these monuments of the first, or ra-  
ther carlier, inhabitants of my native country.—  
  
Since the year 1810, (without previously intending  
  
it) 1 have visited almost every thing of this kind,  
  
worthy of note, on the Ohio and Mississippi; and  
  
f this system have governed the  
Mississippi, and Louisi-  
  
THE NATIONAL REGISTER—JULY 10, 1819—AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES, 97  
  
derings of fancy. The following is a sketch of the  
result of those observations :  
I. Throughout, what is denominated by Volney,  
the valley of the Mississippi, there exist the traces  
of a population far beyoed what this extensive and  
fertile portion of the continent, is supposed to have  
possessed : greater, perhaps, than could be sup-  
ported of the present white inhabitants, even with  
the careful agriculture practised in the most popu-  
lous parts of Europe, ‘The reason of this, is to be  
found in the peculiar manners of the inhabitants by  
whom it was formerly occupied; like those of Mex  
ico, their agriculture had for its only object their  
own sustenance—no surplus was demanded for  
commerce with foreign nations, and no part of  
the soil, susceptible of culture, was devoted to pas-  
turage—yet, extensive forests with wild animals  
would still remain. The aggregate population of  
the country might be less, but that of particular  
districts much greater. We must, in this way, ac-  
count for the astonishing population of the vale of  
Mexico, when first known to the Spaniards; per-  
haps equal to any district of the same extent of  
climate.* The astonishing population of Owhyee  
and Otaheite, must be accounted for in the same’  
way. There are certainly many districts on the  
Ohio and Mississipni equally favorable to a numer- &#x27;  
ous population. When I contemplated the beauty  
and fertility of those spots, I could scarcely believe  
it possible, that they should never have supported.  
a numerous population; such a fact would form an  
exception to what has usually occurred, in every  
other part of the globe. ‘  
II. In the valley of the Mississippi, there are dis-  
covered the traces of two distinct races of people,  
or periods of population, one much more ancient  
than the other. The traces of the last are the most  
numerous, but mark a population less advanced in  
civilization; in fact they belong to the same race  
that existed in the country when the French and  
English effected their settlements on this part of  
the continent; but since the intercourse of these  
people with the whites, and their astonishing di-  
minntion in numbers, many of their customs have  
fallen into disuse. It is not more than a hundred  
and twenty years, since the character of the popu-  
lation, which left the traces of the second period,  
underwert a change. The appearances of fortifi-  
cations, of which so much has been said, and which  
have been attributed to a colony of Welch, are no-  
thing more than the traces of pallisadoed towns or  
villages. ‘The first travellers mention this custom  
of surrounding their.towns with pallisades; the  
earth was thrown up afew feet, and pickets placed  
on the top. I have secn old volumes in which they  
are represented in the engravings. The Arikara  
and Mandan villages are still fortified ‘in this way.  
The traces of these are astonishingly numerous in  
the western country; I should not exaggerate if I  
were to say that five thousand might be found —  
Some of them inclose more than an hundred acres.  
From some cause or other (and we know that there  
are enough which might suffice to effect it) the po-  
pulation had been astonishingly diminished imme-  
diately before we became acquainted with them;  
and yet Charlevoix mentions a town of the Mascu-  
tin tribe (at present incorporated with the Kicka

poos) containing a thousand families! The barrows,  
or general receptacles of the dead, such as examin-  
ed by yourself, may be classed with the pallisadoed  
towns, though they are much more numerous; they  
are, in fact; to be found in almost every cornfield  
in the western country The tumuli or mounds,  
are often met with, where there is no appearance  
of pallisadoed villages or fortifications, or of bar-  
rows.  
  
Ill. The first and more ancient period, is mark-  
ed by those extraordinary tumulti or mounds. I  
have reason to belicve that their antiquity is very  
great. The oldest Indians have no tradition as to  
‘their authors, or the purposes for which they were  
originally intended; yet they were formerly, I might  
almost say instinctively, in the habit of using them  
for one of the purposes for which they were at first  
designed, to wit, as places of defence. The old  
chief Du Coin, told Mr Rice Jones that the mounds  
in the American bottom had been fortified by the  
Kaskaskias in their wars with the Iroquois An  
old work by Lafitau, a jesuit, which 1 met with at  
New Orleans, cgntaias a curious plate in which one  
of these mounds fortified by pallisades on the top,  
and large beams cxtending to the bottom, is assaukt-  
ed by enemies. These tumuli as well as the fortifi  
cations, are to be found at the junction of all the  
considerable rivers, in the most eligible positions  
for towns, and in the most extensive bodies of fer-  
tile land. Their number exceeds perhaps three  
thousand; the smallest not less than twenty feet in  
height, and one hundred in diameter at the base —  
Their great number, and the astonishing size of  
some of them, may be régarded as furnishing, with  
other circumstances, evidence of their antiquity.—  
Thave been sometimes induced to think that at the  
period when those mounds were constructed, there  
existed on the Mississippi, a population as numer-  
ous as that which once animated the borders of the  
Nile, or of the Euphrates, or of Mexico and Peru.  
  
1V. The most numerous, as well as the most  
considerable of these remanas, are found precisely  
in the part of the country where the traces of a  
numerous population might be looked for, to wit,  
from the moutli of the Ohio (on the east side of the  
Mississippi) to the Hlinois river, and on the west  
side from the St. Francis to the Missouri. [ am  
perfectly satisfied that cities similar to those of an-  
cient Mexico, of several hundred thousand souls,  
have existed in this part of the country. Nearly  
opposite St. Louis there are the traces of two: such  
cities, in the distance of five miles, on the bank of  
the Cohokia, which crosses the American bottom at  
this place + There are not less than one hundred  
mouads, in two different groups; one of the mounds  
falis little short of the Egyptian pyramid Mycerius’  
When [ examined it in 1811, I was astonished that  
this stupendous monument of antiquity should have  
been uan?ticed by any traveller: L afterwards pub-  
lished an account in the newspupers at St. Louis, de-  
tailing its dimensions, describing its form, position,  
&amp;c. but this, which I thoaght might almost be con-  
sidered a discovery, attracted no notice; and yet }  
stated it to be eight hundred paces in circumfer-  
ence (the exact size of the pyramid of Asychis)  
and one hundred feet in height. The mounds at  
Grave Creek and Marietta are of the second or  
third class. ‘Phe mounds at St. Louis, at New-M

13. Near Washington, (M. T.) 146 feet in heigth.  
  
14. At Baton Rouge, and onthe bayou Manchac;  
one of the mounds near the lake is chiefly compos. .  
ed of shelis—the inhabitants have taken away great  
quantities of these for the purpose of making lime.  
  
15. The mound on Black River, of two stages,  
with a group around it,  
  
At each of these places there are groups of  
mounds; and at each there probably once existed a  
city. On the other considerable rivers which are  
tributary to the Ohio and Mississippi, in Kentucky,  
Tennessee, state of Ohio, Indiana Territory, &amp;e.  
they are equally numerous. But the principal city  
and center of population was between the Ohio,  
Mississippi, Missouri, and Ulinois.  
  
I have been informed that in the plains between-  
the Arkansa and St. Francis, they are numerous  
and some very large. ‘hey resemble the Teocalli, ©  
in these important features, Ist, in their positions  
the cardinal points are observed with considerable  
accuracy. 2.1, ‘he larger mounds have several  
stages. Sd, In every group there are two mounds ©  
much larger than the others. 4th, he smaller  
mounds are placedaround symmetrically. A closer  
examination would show a resemblance in other  
particulars. {it is doubted by Humboldt whether  
advantage had not been taken of some natural rise,  
in the formation of the pyramid of Cholula; with  
respect to the mound of Cohokia, there can be no  
doubt, for it stands in the midst of alluvium, and  
there is no natural hill nearer than two miles.§  
  
Such are the appearances of antiquity in the wes-  
tern country, which I consider as _ furnishing  
proof of an ancient and numerous population. the  
resemblance to those of New Spain would render  
probable the existence of the same arts and customs;  
perhaps of an tmtercourse. The distance from the  
large mounds on Red River, to the nearest in New  
Spain is not so great but they might be considered  
as existing in the same country.  
  
From the description of the Adoratorious, as they  
are calied, it appears highly probable that the  
mounds on the Mississippi were destined for the  
same purposes. Solis tells us, that every conside-  
derable place had a number of them, upon which a  
kind of tower was erected, and which gave rise to

the belief of those who first visited the coast of  
New Spain, that they had seen cities with nume-  
rous steeples;| from which circumstance they be-  
stowed upon it the name of their native country.  
The four great cities to which the general name of  
Mexico was given, contained two thousand ot  
thesg Adoratorious or Teocalli; at the first glance,  
this vast population, equal perhaps to London or  
Paris, appeared to be crowned with innumerable  
towers and steeples. Architecture was perhaps  
too much in its infancy to enable them to build to  
any great height, a mound was therefore raised,  
and a building erected on the top. It was in this  
way the temple of Belus at Babylon was erected,  
and the Egyptian pyramids of the second class which  
are solid, and probably the most ancient. Besides  
being places of adoration, the Tevcalli also served  
as fortresses; they were usually the last places, to  
which the inhabitants of the cities conquered by  
Cortez, resorted, after having been driven from  
every other quarter. They were enabled from the  
position, form, and the tower on the top, to defend  
themselves in these Situations to great advantage.  
Placed from the bottom to the top of the mount,  
by gradations above each other, they appeared (as  
Solis in his animated style expresses it) to consti-  
tute “a living hill;” and at first, judging only from  
the experience of their own wars, they fancied  
themselves unassailable.  
  
From the oldest book extant, the bible, we see  
exemplified in numerous instances, the natural pre-  
dilection for resorting to high places, for the spur-  
pose of worship; this prevailed amongst all nations,  
and probably the first edifice deditated to the Deity  
was an elevation of earth, the next step was the  
placing a temple on it, and finally churches and  
mosques were built with steeples” This having  
prevailed in all countries may be considered as the  
dictale of nation. The most ancient temples of the  
Greeks were erected on artificial, or natural eleva-  
tions of earth; at the present day, almost every  
part of Europe and Asia, exhibits these remains of  
tumuli, the rudest, though perhaps the most last-  
ing of human works. “fhe mausoleum generally  
holds the next place to the temple; and, what is re-  
markable, all nations in their wars have made the  
last stand in the edifices consecrated to their gods,  
and near to the tombs of their ancestors. The Ado-  
ratorios of New Spain, like all works of the kind an-  
swered the three purposes of the temple, the for-  
tress, and the mausoleum. Can we entertain a  
doubt but that this was also the case with those of  
the Mississippi?  
  
The antiquity of these mounds is certainly very  
great; this is not inferred from the growth of trees,  
which prove an antiquity of a few centuries, but  
from this simple reflection; a people capable of  
works requiring so much labor, must be numerous,  
and ifnumerous, somewhat advanced in the arts;  
we might therefore look for works of stone or brick,  
the traces of which would remain for at least eight  
or ten centuries. The great mound of Cohokia, is  
evidently constructed with as much regularity as  
any of the Teocalli of New Spain, and was doubtless  
chased with brick or stone, and crowned with build-  
ings; but of these no traces remain. Near the  
mound at St. Louis, there are afew decaying stones,  
but which may have been casually brought there.  
The pyramid of Papantla,.in the northern part of  
the Intendency of Vera Cruz, unknown to the first  
conquerors, and discovered a few years ago, was  
still partly cased with bricks. We might be war-  
ranted in considering the mounds of the Mississip-  
  
  
  
  
  
29.  
  
pi more ancient than the Teocalli, a fact worthy of  
notice, although the stages are still plain in some of  
them, the gradations or steps have disappeared, in  
the course of time the rains having washed them  
off. The pieces of obsidian or flint, are found in  
great quantities near them, as is the case with the  
Teocalli. Some might be startled if I should say  
that the mound of Cohokia is as’ancient as those of  
Egypt! The Mexicans possessed but imperfect tra-  
ditions of the construction of their Teocalli, their  
traditions attribute them to the ‘oultees, or to the  
Olmees,who probably migrated from the Mississippi.  
Who will pretend to speak with certainty as to  
the antiquity of America—the races of men who  
have-flourished and disappeared—of the thousand  
revolutions, which, like other parts of the globe, it  
has undergone? Te philosophers of Europe, with  
a narrowness and selfishness of mind, have endea-  
voured to depreciate every thing which relates to  
it. They have called it the Wew MVorld, as though  
its formation was posterior to the rest of the habita-  
ble globe. A few facts suffice to repel this idea :—  
the antiquity of her mountains, the remains of vol-  
canoes, the alluvial tracts, the wearing away of ca-  
taracts, &amp;c. and the number of primitive languages,  
greater perhaps than in all the rest of the world  
besides: _— Py  
  
The use of letters, and the discovery of the ma-  
riner’s compass, the invenfion of gunpowder and  
of printing, have produced incalculable changes in  
the old world. £ question much whether before  
those periods, comparatively recent, there existed,  
or could exist, nations more civilized than the Mex-  
icans or Peruvians. In morals, the Greeks and Ro-  
mans, in their most enlightened days, were not su-  
perior to the Mexicans. We are told that these  
people sacrificed human beings to their gods! Did  
not the Romans sacrifice their unfortunate prison-  
ers to their depraved and wicked pleasures, compel-  
ling them to kill each other? Was the sacrifice of  
Ephigenia, to obtain a favorable wind, an act of less  
barbarity than the sacrifices by the Mexicans of  
their prisoners on the altar of their gods? The Pe-  
ruvians were exempt from these crimes—perhaps  
the mildest and most innocent people that ever  
lived, and in the arts as much advanced as were the  
ancient Persians or Egyptians; and not only in the  
arts, but even in the sciences. Was ever any work  
ofthe old world superior to the two roads from  
Quito to Cusco 2,  
  
Pardon me, sir, for troubling you with this long,  
and perhaps tiresome letter, dictated probably by  
the vanity of personally communicating my crude  
theories to. one who holds so distinguished a place  
in that temple of science which belongs to every age  
and every country.  
  
With sentiments of the highest respect,  
I am, Sir, your most obedient humble serv’t.

lt Dr. Robertson, who is disposed to lessen every  
thing American, and to treat with contempt, un-  
worthy of a philosopher, ‘all their acts and advanc-  
thent. in civilization, attributes this to the imagina-

Quixotic adventure.

Baton Rouge, July 25, 1813.  
SIR,  
  
From a knowledge that research  
into the history of the primitive in-  
habitants of America is one of your  
favourite amusements, I take the  
liberty of making this communication.  
My attention to the subject was first  
awakened on reading, when a boy,  
the observations contained in the  
‘* Notes on Virginia,” and it has be-  
come, with me, a favourite theme of  
speculation. I often visited the  
mound, and other remains of Indian  
antiquity, in the neighbourhood of  
Pittsburgh, my native town, attract-  
ed by a pleasing interest, of which I  
scarcely knew the cause ; and after-  
wards read, and heard with delight,  
whatever related to these monu-  
ments of the first, or rather earlier,  
inhabitants of my native country.  
Since the year 1810 (without pre-  
viously intending it) | have visited  
almost every thing of this kind,  
worthy of note, on the Ohio and Mis-  
sissippi ; and from examination and  
reflection, something like hypothesis  
has taken the place of the vague  
wanderings of fancy. The following  
is a sketch of the result of those ob-  
servations.  
  
1. Throughout what is denomina-  
ted by Volney, the valley of the Mis-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
VOL. I.]  
  
sissippi, there exist the traces of a  
population far beyond what this ex-  
tensive and fertile portion of the  
continent is supposed to have pos-  
sessed ; greater, perhaps, than could  
be supported of the present white  
inhabitants, even with the careful  
agriculture practised in the most po-  
pulous parts of Europe. The rea-  
son of this, is to be found in the pe-  
culiar manners of the inhabitants by  
whom it was formely occupied ; like  
those of Mexico, their agriculture  
had for its only object their own sus-  
tenance—no surplus was demanded  
for commerce with foreign nations,  
and no part of the soil, susceptible of  
culture, was devoted to pasturage——  
yet, extensive forests filled with wild  
animals would stillremain. The ag-  
gregate population of the country  
might be less, but that of particular  
districts much greater. We must,  
in this way, account for the astonish-  
ing population of the vale of Mexico,  
when first known to the Spaniards,  
perhaps equal to any district of the  
same extent of climate.* The as-  
tonishing population of Owyhee, and  
Otaheite, must be accounted for in  
the same way. There are certainly  
many districts on the Ohio and Mis-  
sissippi, equally favourable to a nu-  
merous population. When I con-  
templated the beauty and fertility of  
those spots, I could scarcely believe  
it possible, that they should never  
have supported a numerous popula-  
tion; such a fact would form an ex-  
ception to what has usually occurred,  
in every other part of the globe.  
  
II. Inthe valley of the Mississippi,  
there are discovered the traces of  
two distinct races of people, or pe-  
riods of population, one much more  
ancient than the other* The traces  
of the last are the most numerous,  
but mark a population less advanced  
in civilization ; in fact, they belong  
to the same race that existed in the  
country when the French and Eng

lish effected their settlements on this  
part of the continent: but since the  
intercourse of these people with the  
whites, and their astonishing diminu-  
tion in numbers, many of their cus-  
toms have fallen into disuse. It is  
not more than a hundred and twenty  
years since the character of the po-  
pulation, which left the traces of the  
second period, underwent a change.  
The appearances of fortifications, of  
which so much has been said, and  
which have been attributed to a co-  
lony of Welch, are nothing more  
than the traces of pallisadoed towns  
or villages. ‘The first travellers  
mention this custom of surrounding  
their towns with pallisades ; the earth  
was thrown up a few feet, and pick-  
ets placed on the top. I have seen  
old volumes in which they are repre-  
sented in the engravings.* The  
Arikara and Mandan villages are still  
fortified in this way. The traces of  
these are astonishingly numerous in  
the western country ; I should not  
exaggerate if | were to say that five  
thousand might be found. Some of  
them inclose more than an hundred  
acres. From some cause or other  
(and we know that there are enough  
which might suffice to effect it) the  
population had been astonishingly di-  
minished immediately before we be-  
came acquainted with them; and  
yet Charlevoix mentions a town of  
the Mascutin tribe (at present incor-  
porated with the Kickapoos) contain-  
ing a thousand families! The bar-  
rows, or general receptacles of the  
dead, such as examined by yourself,  
may be classed with the pallisadoed  
towns, though they are much more  
numerous ; they are, in fact, to be  
found in almost every cornfield in  
the western country. The tumuli  
or mounds, are often met with where  
there is no appearance of pallisado

ed villages or fortifications, or of  
barrows.  
  
Ili. The first and more ancient  
period is marked by those extraordi-  
nary tumulior mounds. I have rea-  
son to believe that their antiquity is  
very great. The oldest Indians  
have no tradition as to their authors,  
or the purposes for which they were  
originally intended ; yet they were  
formerly, I might almost say instinct-  
ively, in the habit of using them for  
one of the purposes for which they  
were at first designed, to wit, as  
places of defence. The old chief  
Du Coin, told Mr. Rice Jones, that  
the mounds in the American bottom  
had been fortified by the Kaskaskias  
in their wars with the Iroquois. An  
old work by Latitau, a jesuit, which |  
met with at New Orleans, contains a  
curious plate, in which one of these  
mounds, fortified by pallisades on the  
top, and large beams extending to  
the bottom, 1s assaulted by enemies.  
These tumuli, as well as the fortifi-  
cations, are to be found at the junc-  
tion of all the considerable rivers,  
in the most eligible positions for.  
towns, and in the most extensive  
bodies of fertile land. Their num-  
ber exceeds, perhaps, three thousand ;  
the smallest not less than twenty feet  
in height, and one hundred in diame-  
ter at the base. Their great num-  
ber, and the astonishing size of some  
of them, may be regarded as furnish-  
ing, with other circumstances, evi-  
dence of their antiquity. I have  
been sometimes induced to think that  
at the period when those mounds were  
constructed, there existed on the  
Mississippi a population as numerous  
as that which once animated the  
borders of the Nile, or of the Eu  
phrates, or of Mexico and Peru.  
  
IV. The most numerous, as well  
as the most considerable of these re-  
mains, are found precisely in the  
  
part of the country where the traces  
- of a numerous population might be  
looked for, to wit, from the mouth  
of the Ohio (on the east side of the  
  
  
  
  
  
[VoL. I.  
  
Mississippi) to the Tlinois river,  
and on the west side from the St.  
Francis to the Missouri. 1 am per-  
fectly satisfied that cities similar to  
those of Ancient Mexico, of several  
hundred thousand souls, have existed  
in this part of the country. Nearly  
opposite St. Louis, there are the  
traces of two such cities, in the dis-  
tance of five miles, on the bank of  
the Cohokia, which crosses the  
American bottom at this place.*  
There are not less than one hundred  
mounds, in two different groups:  
one of the mounds falls little short  
of the Egyptian pyramid Mycerius.  
When I| examined it in 1811, I was  
astonished that this stupendous mo-  
nument of antiquity should have  
been unnoticed by any traveller: I  
afterwards published an account in  
the newspapers at St. Louis, detail-  
ing its dimensions, describing its  
form, position, &amp;c. but this, which I  
thought might almost be considered  
a discovery, attracted no notice : and  
yet I stated it to be eight hundred  
paces in circumference (the exact  
size of the pyramid of Asychis) and  
one hundred feet in height. The  
mounds at Grave Creek and Mari-  
etta are of the second or third class.  
  
The mounds at St. Louis, at New .  
  
Madrid, and at the commencement of  
Black River, are all larger than those  
of Marietta. The following is an  
enumeration of the most considera-  
ble mounds on the Mississippi and  
on the Ohio; the greater part | ex-  
amined myself with such attention  
as the short time | had to spare  
would permit.  
  
1. At Great Creek, below Wheel-  
ing.  
  
2. At Pittsburg.  
  
3. At Marfeita.  
  
4. At Cincinnati.  
  
5. At New Madrid—one of them

formerly the bed of the river.  
  
13. Near. Washington (M. T.)  
146 feet in height.  
  
14. At Baton Rouge, and on the  
Bayou Manchac—one of the mounds  
near the lake is chiefly composed of  
shells—the inhabitants have taken  
away great quantities of these for the  
purpose of making lime.  
  
15. The mound on Black River,  
of two stages, with a group around  
it.  
  
At each of these places there are  
eroups of mounds; and at each  
there probably once existed a city.  
On the other considerahle rivers  
which are tributary to the Ohio and  
Mississippi, in Kentucky, Tennessee,  
state of Ohio, Indiana Territory, &amp;c.  
they are equally numerous. But  
the principal city and center of po-  
pulation was between the Ohio,  
Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois.  
I have been informed, that fn the  
plains between the Arkansa and St.  
Francis they are numerous, and  
some very large. They resemble  
the Teocalli, in these important fea-  
tures, 1. In their positions the car-  
dinal points are observed with consi  
derable accuracy. 2. The larger  
mounds have several stages. 3. In  
every group there are two mounds  
much larger than the others. 4.  
The smaller mounds are placed  
around symmetrically. A closer  
examination would show a resem-  
blance in other particulars. It is  
doubted by Humboldt whether ad-  
  
_ vantage had not been taken of some  
  
natural rise in the formation of the

pyramid of Cholula: with respect to  
the mound of: Cohokia, there can be  
no doubt, for it stands in the midst  
of alluvium, and there is no natural  
hill nearer than two miles.*  
  
Such are the appearances of anti-  
quity in the western country, which  
1 consider as furnishing proof of an  
ancient and numerous population.  
The resemblance to those of New  
Spain would render probable the  
existence of the same arts and cus-  
toms ; perhaps of an intercourse.  
The distance from the large mounds  
on Red River, to the nearest in New  
Spain, is not so great but they might  
be considered as existing in the same  
country.  
  
From the description of the Ado-  
ratorios, as they are called, it ap-  
pears highly probable that the  
mounds on the Mississippi were des-  
tined for the same purposes. Solis  
tells us, that every considerable  
place had a number of them, upon  
which a kind of tower was erected,  
and which gave rise to the belief of  
those who first visited the coast of  
New Spain, that they had seen cities  
with numerous steeples ;{ from  
which circumstance they bestowed  
upon it the name of their native  
country. The four great cities to  
which the general name of Mexico  
was given, contained two thousand  
of these Adoratorios, or Teocalli ; at  
the first glance, this vast population,  
equal perhaps to London or Paris,  
appeared to be crowned with innu-  
merable towers and steeples. Ar-  
chitecture was, perhaps, too much  
in its infancy to enable them to build  
to any great height ; a mound was,  
therefore, raised, and a_ building  
erected on the top. It was in this  
way the temple of Belus at Babylon

every thing American, and to ‘treat with con-

mids of the second class, which are  
solid, and probably the most ancient.  
Besides, being places of adoration,  
the Teocalli also served as fortress-  
es ; they were usually the last places  
to which the inhabitants of the cities  
conquered by Cortez resorted, after  
having been driven from every other  
quarter. They were enabled, from  
the position, form, and the tower on  
the top, to defend themselves in  
these situations to great advantage.  
Placed from the bottom to the top of  
the mount, by gradations above each  
other, they appeared (as Solis in his  
animated style expresses it) to consti-  
tute ‘a living hill; and at first,  
judging only from the experience of  
their own wars, they fancied them-  
selves unassailable.  
  
From the oldest book extant, the  
bible, we see exemplified in nume-  
rous instances, the natural predilec-  
tion for resorting to high places, for  
the purpose of worship; this pre-  
vailed amongst all nations, and pro-  
bably the first edifice dedicated to  
the Deity was an elevation of earth,  
the next step was the placing a tem-  
ple on it, and finally churches and  
mosques were built with steeples.  
This having prevailed in all coun-  
tries, may be considered as the dic-  
tale of nation. The most ancient  
temples of the Greeks were erected  
on artificial or natural elevations of  
earth; at the. present day, almost  
every part of Europe and Asia exhi-  
bits these remains of tumuli, the  
rudest, though perhaps the most last-  
ing of human works.* The mauso-  
leum generally holds the next place  
to the temple ; and, what is remark-  
able, all nations in their wars have  
made the last stand in the edifices  
consecrated to their gods, and near  
to the tombs of their ancestors. The  
Adoratorios of New Spain, like all  
works of the kind, answered the three

purposes of the temple, the fortress,  
and the mausoleum. Can we enter-  
tain a doubt but that this was also  
the case with those of the Missis-  
sippi ?  
  
The antiquity of these mounds is  
certainly very great ; this is not in-  
ferred from the growth of trees,  
which prove an antiquity of a few  
centuries, but from this simple re-  
flection ; a people capable of works  
requiring so much labour, must be  
numerous, and if numerous, some-  
what advanced in the arts ; we might  
therefore look for works of stone or  
‘brick, the traces of which would re-  
  
  
  
main for at least eight or ten centu-  
‘ries. The great mound of Cohokia,  
|is evidently constructed with as much  
regularity as any of the Teocalli of  
New Spain, and was doubtless chased  
with brick or stone, and crowned  
with buildings; but of these no  
traces remain. Near the mound at  
St. Louis, there are a few decaying  
stones, but which may have been  
casually brought there. The pyra-  
mid of Papantla, ‘in the northern  
part of the Intendency of Vera Cruz,  
unknown to the first conquerors, and  
discovered a few years ago, was still  
partly cased with bricks. We might  
be warranted in considering the  
mounds of the Mississippi more an-  
cient than the Teocalli: a fact wor-  
thy ofnotice, although the stages are  
still plain in some of them, the gra-  
dations or steps have disappeared in  
the course of time, the rains having  
washed them off. The pieces of  
obsidian or flint, are found in great  
quantities near them, as is the case  
with the Teocalli. Some might be  
startled if I should say that the  
mound of Cohokia is as ancient as  
those of Egypt! The Mexicans pos-  
sessed but imperfect traditions of the  
construction of their Teocalli; their  
traditions attribute them to the Toul-

rica—of the races of men who have  
flourished and disappeared—of the  
thousand revolutions, which, lke  
other parts of the globe, it has un-  
dergone ? The philosophers of Eu-  
rope, with a narrowness and selfish-  
ness of mind, have endeavoured to  
depreciate every thing which relates  
to it. They have called it the New  
World, as though its formation was  
posterior to the rest of the habitable  
globe.. A few facts suffice to repel  
this idea: the antiquity of her moun-  
tains, the remains of volcanoes, the  
alluvial tracts, the wearing away of  
cataracts, &amp;c. and the number of  
primitive languages, greater, per-  
haps, than in all the rest of the world  
besides,  
  
The use of letters, and the disco-  
very of the mariner’s compass, the in-  
vention of gunpowder and of printing,  
have produced incalculable changes  
inthe old world. I question much  
whether, before those periods, com-  
paratively recent, there existed, or  
could exist, nations more civilized  
than the Mexicans or Peruvians. In  
morals, the Greeks and Romans, in  
their most enlightened days, were  
  
‘not superior to the Mexicans. We  
  
are told that these people sacrificed  
human beings to their gods! did not  
the Romans sacrifice their unfortu-  
nate prisoners to their depraved and  
wicked pleasures, compelling them  
to kill each other? Was the sacri-  
fice of Iphigenia, to obtain a favour-  
able wind, an act of less barbarity  
than the»sacrifices by the Mexicans  
of their prisoners on the altar of their  
gods ? The Peruvians were exempt  
from these crimes—perhaps the  
mildest and most innocent people  
that ever lived, and in the arts as  
much advanced as were the ancient  
Persians or Egyptians ; and not only  
in the arts, but even in the sciences.  
Was ever any works of the old world  
superior to the two roads from Quito  
to Cusco ?

country when the French and English effected their  
settlements on this part of the continent: but since the  
intercourse of these people with the whites, and their  
very great diminution in numbers, many of their cus-  
toms have fallen into disuse. It is not more than a  
hundred and twenty years, since the character of the  
population which left the traces of the second period,  
underwent a change. The appearances of fortifica-  
tions, of which have been attributed to a colony of  
Welsh, are in general but the traces of Palisadoed  
towns or villages. ‘The first travelers mention this  
custom of surrounding their towns with palisades: the  
earth was thrown upa few feet, and pickets placed  
on the top. Ihave seen old volumes in which they  
are represented in the engravings. The Arikara and  
Mandan villages are still fortified in this way. The  
traces of these are numerous in the western country ;  
I should not exagerate if I were to say that thousands  
might be found. Some of thein enclose more than a  
hundred acres. From some cause or other (and we  
know that there are enough which might suffice to ef-  
fect ~ the population has been greatly diminished  
immediately before we became acquainted with  
them; and yet Charlevoix mentions a town of the  
Mascutin tribe (at present incorporated with the  
Kickapoos,) containing a thousand families! The  
barrows, or general receptacles of the dead, such as  
examined by Mr. Jefferson, may be classed with the  
palisadoed towns, though they are much more nunier-  
ous; they are in fact to be found in almost every corn-  
field in the western country. The tumuli or mounds  
are often met with, where there is no appearance of  
palisadoed villages or fortifications, or of barrows.  
  
The first and more ancient period is marked by  
those extraordinary tumuli or mounds. I have rea-  
son to believe that their antiquity is comparatively  
very great. The oldest Indians have no tradition as  
to their authors, or the purposes for which they were  
originally intended; yet they were formerly, 1 might  
almost say instinctively, in the habit of using them  
for one of the purposes for which they were at first  
designed, to wit, as placesof defence. The old chief  
Du Coin: told Mr. Rice Jones that the mounds in the  
American bottom, had been fortified by the Kaskas-  
kias in their wars with the Iroquois. An old work by  
Lafitau, a Jesuite. which I met with at New Orleans,  
contains a curious plate, in which one of these  
mounds, fortified by palisades on the top, and  
large beams extending to the bottom, is assaulted by  
enemies. These tumuli as well as the fortifications,  
are to be found at the junction of all the considerable  
rivers, in the most eligible positions for towns, and in  
the most extensive bodies of fertile land. Their num-  
ber exceeds perhaps three thousand; the smallest not  
less than twenty feet in height, and one hundred in  
diameter at the base. Their great number, and the  
astonishing size of some of them, may be regarded  
as furnishing, with other circumstances, evidence of  
their antiquity. Ihave been sometimes induced to  
think, that at the period when those mounds were  
constructed, there existed on the Mississippi, a popu-  
lation as numerous as that which once animated the  
borders of the Nile, or of the Euphrates, or of Mexi-  
coand Peru.  
  
The most numerous, as well asthe most considera-  
ble of these remains, are found precisely in those  
parts of the country where the traces of a numerous  
population might be looked for, to wit : from the mouth  
of the Ohio (on the east side of the Mississippi) to the  
Illinois river, and on the west side from the St. Fran-  
cis to the Missouri. I am perfectly satisfied that cit-  
ies similar to those of ancient Mexico, have existed  
in this partof the country. Nearly opposite St. Lou-  
is there are the traces of two such cities in the dis-  
  
tance of five miles, on the bank of the Cohokia,  
which crosses the American bottom at this place.—  
There are not less than one hundred mounds, in two  
ditterent groups, one of immense size. WhenI ex-  
amined it in 1811, I was surprised that this stupend-  
ous monument of antiquity should have been unno-  
ticed by any traveler: I afterwards published an ac-  
count in the newspapers at St. Louis, detailing its  
dimensions, describing its form, position, et cetra,  
but this which I thought might also be considered a  
discovery, attracted no notice: and yet I stated it to  
be five hundred paces in circumference [about the  
size of the pyramid of Asychis] and eighty feet in  
height. The mounds at Grave Creek and Marietta  
are of the second or thirdclass. The mounds at 8t.  
Louis, at New Madrid, and at the commencement of  
Black River, are all larger than those of Marietta.—  
The following is an enumeration of the most consider-  
able mounds on the Mississippi and on the Ohio; the  
greater part I examined myself with such attention as  
the shorttime I had to spare would permit.  
  
At Great Creek, below Wheeling, Pittsburgh, via  
Marietta, Cincinnati, New Madrid—one of them 350  
feet diameter at the base, Bois Brule bottom, fifteen  
miles below St. Genevieve, St. Genieve, Mouth of the  
Marmeck, St. Louis—one with two stages, another  
with three, Mouth of the Missouri, on the Cohair  
river—in two groups, twenty miles below; two groups  
also, but the mounds of a smaller size—on the back  
of a lake, formerly the bed of the river, near Wash-  
ington, M. T. 149 feet in height, At Batan Rouge  
and on the bayou Manchac—one of the mounds near  
the lake is chiefly composed of shells—the inhabi-  
tants have taken away great quantities of these for  
the purpose of making lime, the mound on Black  
River, of two stages with a group around it.  
  
At each of these places there are groups of mounds;  
and at each there probably was once a city. On the  
considerable rivers which are tributary to the Ohio  
and Mississippi, in Kentucky, Tennessee, state of O-  
hio, Indiana Territory, &amp;c. they are also numerous.—  
But the principal city and centre of population was  
between the Ohio, Mississippi, Missouri, and Illi-  
nois. Ihave been informed, that in the plains be-  
tweenthe Arkansa and St. Francis, they are numer-  
ous, and some very large. They resemble the Teo-  
calli, in these important features, 1. In their posi-  
tions the cardinal points are observed with considera-  
able accuracy. 2. The large mounds have several  
  
  
  
  
  
stages. 3. In every group there are two mounds  
much larger than the others. 4. The smaller mounds  
are placed around symmetrically. A closer examina-  
tion would show a resemblance in other particulars.  
It is doubted by Humboldt whether advantage had  
| not been taken of some natural rise, in the formation  
| of the pyramid of Cholula; with respect to the mound  
| of Cohokia, there can be no doubt, for it stands in the  
| midst of alluvium, and there is no natural hill nearer  
| than two miles.  
  
Such are the appearances of antiquity in the west-  
ern country, which I consider as furnishing proof of  
an ancient and numerous population. The resem-  
blance to those of New Spain would render probable  
the existence of the same arts and customs; perhaps  
of anintercourse. The distance from the large mound  
&#x27;on Red river, to the nearest in New-Spain, is not so  
  
great but that they might be considered as living in  
the same country.  
  
From the description of the Adoratories, as the  
are called, it appears highly probable that the mounds  
on the Mississippi were destined for the same pur-  
pose. Solis tell us, that every considerable place had  
a number of them, upon which a kind of tower was  
erected, and which gave rise to the belief of those

this vast population, equal perhaps to London or Par-  
  
in its infancy to enable them to build to any great  
height; a mound or terrace was therefore raised, and  
a building erected on the top. It was in this way  
the temple of Belus at Babylon was erected; and the  
Egyptian pyramids of the second class, which are  
solid, and probably the most ancient. Besides being  
places of adoration, the Teocalli also served as for-  
tresses; they were usually the last places, to which  
the inhabitants of the cities conquered by Cortez, re-  
sorted, after having been driven from every other  
quarter. They were enabled from the position, form,  
and the tower on the summit, to defend themselves in  
these situations to great advantage. Placed fromthe  
bottom to the top ot the mount, by gradations above  
each other, they appeared (as Solis in his animated  
style expressed it) to constitute “a living hill;’’ and  
at first, judging only from the experience of their own  
wars, they fancied themselves sate from every assault.  
  
From the oldest book extant, the Bible, we see ex-  
emplified in numerous instances, the natural predilec-  
tion for resorting to “high places,” for the purpose of  
worship;this prevailed amongst all nations, and proba-  
bly the first edifice dedicated to the Deity, was an  
elevation of earth with an altar, the next step was the  
placing a temple on it, and finally churches and  
mosques were built in the steeples. This having  
prevailed in all countries, may be considered asthe  
dictate of nature. The most ancient temples of the  
  
Greeks were erected on artificial or natural ‘eleva- |  
  
tions of earth; at the present day, almost every part  
of Europe and Asia, exhibits these remains, of tumuli,  
  
« the rudest, though perhaps the most lasting of human |  
  
works. The mausoleum generally holds the next  
= to the temple; and, all nations in their wars  
have made the last stand in the edifice consecrated  
to their gods, and near to the tombs of their ances-  
tors. The Adoratorios of New Spain, like all works  
of the kind, answered the three purposes, of the tem-  
ple, the fortress, and the mausoleum. Can we enter-  
tain a doubt but that this was the case with those of  
the Mississippi.  
  
The antiquity of these mounds is certainly very

there. The pyramid of Pampalla, in the northern  
part of the Intendency of Vera Cruz, unknown to the  
first conquerors, and discovered a few years ago, was  
still partly cased with bricks. We might be warran-  
ted in considering the mounds of the Mississippi more  
ancient than the Teocalli: a fact worthy of notice, al-  
though the stages are still plain in some ef them; the  
gradations or steps have disappeared, in the course of  
time the rains having washed them off. Pieces of  
flint, are found in great quantities near them, as is the  
case with the Teocalli. Some might be startled if I  
should say that the pyramid of Cohokia is as ancient  
as those of Egypt! The Mexicans possessed but im-  
perfect traditions of the construction of their Teocalli;  
their traditions attribute them tothe Toultees, or to

Who will pretend to speak with confidence as to  
the antiquity of America—the races of men who have  
flourished and disappeared—of the thousand revolu-  
tions, which, like other parts of the globe, it has un-  
dergone?’ The philosophers of Europe, with a nar-  
rowness of mind truly unphilosophic, have endeavor-  
ed to depreciate every thing which relates to it.—  
They have called it the “New World,” as though  
its formation was posterior to the rest of the habitable  
globe. A few facts sufficient to repel this idea :—  
the antiquity of her mountains, the remains of volca-  
noes, the alluvial tracts, the wearing away of cataracts,  
&amp;e., and the number of primitive languages, equal  
to that of Enrope and Asia.  
  
The use of letters, and the discovery of the mari-  
ner’s compass, the invention of gunpowder and of  
printing, have produced incalculable changes in the  
old world. I question much, whether, betore those  
  
| periods, comparatively recent, there existed or could

exist, nations more civilized than the Mexicans, or  
Peruvians. In morals, the Greeks and Romans, in  
their most enlightened days, were not superior to  
the Mexicans. We are told that these people sacri-  
Did not the Ro-  
mans sacrifice their unfortunate prisoners to their de-  
  
great; this is not inferred from the growth of trees, praved and wicked pleasures, compelling them to  
  
which prove an antiquity of a few centuries, but from | kill each other?  
  
Was the sacrifice of Ephigenia, to  
  
this simple reflection; a people capable of works re-| obtain a favorable wind, an act of less barbarity than  
quiring so much labor must be numerous, and if nu-| the sacrifices by the Mexicans of their prisoners o
