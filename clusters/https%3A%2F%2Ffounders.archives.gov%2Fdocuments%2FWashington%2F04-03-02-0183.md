ty. but all agree that, a spark may set the whole in flames. indeed Bavaria it is expected will yet do that.  
It is to be hoped that our Minister at the Court of London will bring that Government to an explanation respecting the Western Posts, which it still retains on the American side of the line, contrary to the spirit, if not to the letter, of the Treaty. My opinion from the first, and so I declared it, was that these Posts would be detained from us as long as they could be held under any pretence whatsoever. I have not changed it, though I wish for cause to do so, as it may ultimately become a serious matter. However singular the opinion may be, I cannot divest myself of it, that the Navigation of the Mississipi, at this time, ought to be no object with us; on the contrary, till we have a little time allowed to open &amp; make easy the ways between the Atlantic States &amp; the Western territory, the obstructions had better remain.  
There is nothing which binds one Country, or one State to another, but interest, without this cement, the Western inhabitants (which more than probably will be composed in a great degree of Foreigners) can have no predeliction for us; and a commercial connection is the only tie we can have upon them—It is clear to me that the Trade of the Lakes, and of the river Ohio as low as the Great Kanhawa, (if not to the Falls) may be brought to the Ports on the Atlantic easier, and cheaper (taking the whole voyage together) than it can be carried to New Orleans. but once open the door to the latter before the obstructions are removed from the former, let commercial connections (which lead to others) be formed, and the habit of that trade be well established, and it will be found no easy matter to divert it. and vice versa—When the Settlements are stronger &amp; more extended to the Westward, the navigation of the river Mississipi will be an object of importance; and we shall be able then (reserving our claim) to speak a more efficacious language than policy, I think, should dictate at present.  
I never have, and I hope never shall hear, any serious mention of a paper emission in this State—yet such a thing may be in agitation—Ignorance &amp; design are productive of much mischief—the first, is the Tool of the latter, and are often set to work  
  
as suddenly as unexpectedly—those with whom I have conversed on this subject, in this part of the state, reprobate the idea exceedingly.

‘* However singular the opinion may be, I can-  
not divest myself of it, that the navigation of  
the Mississippi, at this time, ought to be no ob-  
— with us. On thecontrary, until we havea  
ittle time allowed to open and make easy the  
ways between the Atlantic States and the West-  
ern territory, the obstructions had better re-  
main. There is nothing which binds one country  
or one State to another but interest. Without  
this cement the Western inhabitants, whomore

the older seats of settlement, with only  
here and there a gap to let a road through,  
only here and there two rivers lying close  
enough at their sources to link the east

separation between the two populations  
seemed to him as obvious as the tilt of the  
mountains upon either slope. ‘‘ There is

were brought together, let us first re-  
mind ourselves, not merely because they  
were neighbors and kinsmen, but because  
they were forced to see that they had  
common interests which they could serve  
in no other way. “There is nothing  
which binds one country or one State to  
another but interest,” said Washington.  
“Without this cement the Western in-  
habitants can have no predilection for  
us.” Without that cement the colonies  
could have had no predilection for one  
another. But it is one thing to have  
common interests, and quite another to  
perceive them and act upon them. The  
colonies were first thrust together by the  
pressure of external danger. They need-

sea, as any fool could perceive, if they  
were going to keep their frontiers against  
the Indians, and their outlets upon the  
Western waters from the French. Th
