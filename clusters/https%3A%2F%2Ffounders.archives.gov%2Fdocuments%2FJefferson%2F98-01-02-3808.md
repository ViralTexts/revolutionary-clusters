ear Sir  
Monticello.  
Oct. 12. 23.  
I do not write with the ease which your letter of Sep. 18. supposes. crippled wrists and fingers make writing slow and  laborious. but, while writing to you, I lose the sense of these things, in the recollection of antient times, when youth and health made happiness out of every thing. I forget for a while the hoary winter of age,  when we can think of nothing but how to keep ourselves warm, &amp; how to get rid of our heavy hours until the friendly hand of death shall rid us of all at once. against this tedium vitae however I am fortunately mounted on a Hobby, which indeed I should have better managed some 30. or 40. years ago, but whose easy amble is still sufficient to give exercise &amp; amusement to an Octogenary rider. this is the establishment of an University, on a scale more comprehensive, and in a country more healthy &amp; central than our old William and Mary, which these obstacles have long kept in a state of languor and inefficiency. but the tardiness with which such works proceed may render it doubtful whether I shall live to see it go into action.Putting aside these things however for the present, I write this letter as due to a friendship co-eval with our government &amp; now attempted to be poisoned, when too late in life to be replaced by new affections. I had for some time observed, in the public papers, dark hints &amp; mysterious innuendos of a correspondence of yours with a friend, to whom you had opened your bosom without reserve, &amp; which was to be made public by that friend, or his representative. and now it is said to be actually published. it has not yet reached us, but extracts have been given, &amp; such as seemed most likely to draw a curtain of separation between you &amp; myself. were there no other motive than that of indignation against the author of this outrage on private confidence, whose shaft seems to have been aimed at yourself more particularly, this would make it the duty of every honorable mind to disappoint that aim, by opposing to it’s impression a seven-fold shield of apathy &amp; insensibility. with me however no such armour is needed. the circumstances of the times, in which we have happened to live, &amp; the partiality of our friends, at a particular period, placed us in a state of apparent opposition, which some might suppose to be personal also: &amp; there might not be wanting those who wish’d to make it so, by filling our ears with malignant falsehoods, by dressing up hideous phantoms of their own creation, presenting them to you under my name, to me under your’s, and endeavoring to instill into our minds things concerning each other the most destitute of truth. and if there had been, at any time, a moment when we were off our guard, and in a temper to let the whispers of these people make us forget what we had known of each other for so many years, &amp; years of so much trial, yet all men who have attended to the workings of the human mind, who have seen the false colours under which passion sometimes dresses the actions &amp; motives of others, have seen also these passions subsiding with time and reflection, dissipating, like mists before the rising sun, and restoring to us the sight of all things in their true shape and colours. it would be strange indeed if, at our years, we were to go an age back to hunt up imaginary, or forgotten facts, to disturb the repose of affections so sweetening to the evening of our lives. be assured, my dear Sir, that I am incapable of recieving the slightest impression from the effort now made to plant thorns on the pillow of age, worth, and wisdom, and to sow tares between friends who have been such for near half a century. beseeching you then not to suffer your mind to be disquieted by this wicked attempt to poison it’s peace, and praying you to throw it by, among the things which have never happened, I add sincere assurances of my unabated, and constant attachment, friendship and respect.Th: Jefferso

1M0.XTICKI.L0, Oct. 12. 1823.  
Dear Sir—I do not write with the ease  
which your letter of Sept. I It, supposes. Crip­  
pled wrists and fingers make w itting slow and  
laborious ; hut, whtle writing to yon, I lose tin­  
sens- of these things, in the recollection of an­  
cient times, when youth and health made hap­  
piness nut of every thing. I forget for a while  
the hoary winter of age, when we can think  
of nothing hut howto keep ourselves warm,  
and how to gel rid of our heavy hours until  
the fri» ndly hand of death shall ml us of all at  
once. Against this f«-.lintn vitae, however, I  
am fortunately mounted mi a hohhy, which  
indeed | should have heller managed some 30  
or 40 years ago, hilt whose easy amble is still  
fttifl&#x27;n it-m to gin exercise and amusim-m loan  
octogenary rider. This is the establishment of  
an University, Oil a scale more comprrheu  
sive, and in a country more healthy and cen­  
tral, than nor old William and .Marv, which  
these obstacles have long kept in a slate e(  
languor and inefficiency. Hut the tardinr­  
&quot;itW which such works proceed, may render  
it doubtful, whether I shall lire to see it go  
into action.  
Putting aside these things, however, for the  
present, i write this letter, as due In.i friend­  
ship, co-eval with our government, and now  
attempted to he poisoned, w lien tin* l.i&#x27;e iri

ti-spoudcnre of yours with a fiiend, to whom  
you had opened ymirhnsmn without t-serve,  
and which was to he made public by that  
friend, nr liis representative 5 and now i( 1*  
«»id In be actually published. It lias not yrt  
reached os. hut extracts have been giveo.tiod  
such as seemed most likely to draw a eoriaiii  
of separation lo t w een you hiiiI invs* tf. Were  
there no oMn-r motive than that of indignation  
against the author of Ibis outrage mi private  
confidence ; w hose -haft seems to Imr Im n  
aimed at votuself, more purlicul.-rly ; ||t|,  
would make it the duty of every h«»nm*M  
mind to di-afipoiot that aim, hv oo|io«mg  
Us im(rrc«sioo, a seven-fold shi» Id of apalhv  
and insensibility. With me, however,no sm ii  
  
nrm vur is needed. Tift* ciictiitiif.inces of the  
&#x27;iir.es, in ivliiell vvn* have happened to live, anil  
&#x27;he pailiality of our friend*} at a particular pe

Monricetro, Oct. 12, 1825.  
  
Dear Sir: I do not write with the ease  
which your letter of September 18, sup-  
poses. Crippled wrists and fingers make  
writing slow and Jaborious ; but, while  
writing to you, I lose the sense of these  
things, in the recollection of ancient times,  
when youth and health made happiness out  
of every thing. I forget for a while the  
hoary winter of age, when we can think of  
nothing but how to keep ourselves warm,  
and to get rid of our heavy hours until the  
friendly hand of death shall rid us of all at  
once. Against this tedium vita, however,  
I am fortunately mounted on a hobby,  
which indeed I should have better manag-  
ed some 30 or 40 years ago, but whose  
easy amble is still sufficient to give exer-  
cise and amusement to an Octogenary rl-  
der. This is the establishment of an Uni-  
versity, on a scale more comprehensive,  
and ina country more healthy and central,  
than our old William and Mary, which  
  
langor and inefficiency. But the tardiness  
with which such works proceed, may ren-  
der it doutitful, whether I shall live to see  
it go into action.  
  
Putting aside these things, however, for  
the present, I write this letter, as due to a  
friendship, coeval with our government,  
and now attempted to be poisoned, when  
too late in life to be replaced by new affec-  
I had for some time observed, in  
  
with a friend, to whom you had opened  
your bosom without reserve, and which  
  
representative ; and now it is said to be ac-  
It has not yet reached  
us, but extracts have been given, and such  
as seemed most likely to draw a curtain of  
seperation between you and mysclf. Were  
there no other motive than that of indigna-  
tion against the author of this outrage on  
private confidence ; whose shaft seems to  
have been aimed at yourself, more particu-  
  
norable mind to disappoint that aim, by op-  
posing to its impression a seven-fold shield  
of apathy and insensibility. With me, how-  
no such armour is needed. The cir-  
neces of the times, in which we have  
happened to live, and the partiality of our  
friends at a particular period, placed us in  
a State of apparent opposition, which some  
be personal also: and  
might not be wanting those who  
wished to make it so, by filling our ears  
with malignant falsehoods; by dressing up  
hideous phantoms of their own creation,  
presenting them to vou under my name,  
io me under your’s, and endeavouring to  
instil into our minds, things concerning  
  
ry ‘  
Ci TISk.  
  
|  
  
And, if there had been at any’ time a mo-  
ment when we were off our guard, and ina  
temper to let the whispers of these people  
make us forget what we had known of cach  
other for so nuany years--and years of so  
much triale—yet all men who have attend-  
ed to the workings of the human mind,  
who have seen the false colours under  
which passion sometimes dresses the ac-  
tions and motives of others, have seen also  
these passions subsiding with time and re  
  
flection, dissipating like mists before the  
rising sun, and restoring to us the sight of  
all things in their true shape and colours.  
It would be strange, indeed, if, at our years,  
we were to go an age back to hunt ap im-  
aginary or forgotten facts, to disturb the  
repose of affections, so sweetening to the  
evening of our lives.  
  
Be assured, my dear sir, I am incapable  
of receiving the slightest impression from  
the effort now made, to plant thorns on the  
pillow of age, worth, and wisdom, and to  
sow tares between friends, who have been  
such for near halfa century. Beseeching  
you then not to suffer your mind to be dis  
quieted by this wicked attempt to poison  
its peace, and praying you to throw it by  
among the things which have never happen-  
ed, I add sincere assurances of my unabated  
and constant attachment, friendship, and re-  
spect. TH. JEPFERSON
