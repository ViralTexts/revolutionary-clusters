 two short Letters of which I herewith send you Copies, I have been honoured with yours No. 5 dated the 16th Decr.  
  
Enclosed I send Copies of two Letters from M. le Comte de Vergennes, relating to certain Complaints from Ostend and Copenhagen against our Cruisers. I formerly forwarded a similar Complaint from Portugal, to which I have yet received no Answer. The Ambassador of that Kingdom frequently teazes me for it. I hope now that by your means these kind of Affairs will be more immediately attended to; Ill Blood and Mischief may be thereby sometimes prevented.  
The Marquis de la Fayette was at his Return hither received by all Ranks with all possible Distinction. He daily gains in the General Esteem and Affection and promises to be a great Man here. He is warmly attached to our Cause; we are on the most friendly and confidential footing with each other, and he is really very serviceable to me in my Applications for additional Assistance.  
I have done what I could in recommending Messrs Portail &amp; Gouvion as you desired. I did it with Pleasure as I have much Esteem for them.  
I will endeavour to procure a Sketch of an Emblem for the purpose you mention. This puts me in mind of a Medal I have had a Mind to Strike since the late great Event you give me an Account of; representing the United States by the Figure of an Infant Hercules in his Cradle, strangling the two Serpents, and France by that of Minerva, sitting by as his Nurse with her Spear and Helmet, and her Robe speck’d with a few Fleurs-de-lis. The extinguishing two entire Armies in one War, is what has rarely if ever happen’d, and it gives a presage of the future Force of our growing Empire.  
I thank you much for the News Papers you have been so kind as to send me. I se

An Exchange would make so many of our Countrymen happy, add to our Strength and diminish our Expence. But our Privateers who cruise in Europe will not be at the Trouble of bringing in their Prisoners, and I have none to exchange for them.

for the Great Seal of the United States,  
wrote :

But as he himself wrote to Washington in a letter taking leave, he
