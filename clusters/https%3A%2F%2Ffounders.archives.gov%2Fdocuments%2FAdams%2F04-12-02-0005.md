My dearest Friend,  
Philadelphia March 5. 1797  
  
your dearest Friend never had a more trying day than Yesterday. A Solenm Scene it was indeed and it was made more affecting to me, by the Presence of the General, whose Countenance was as serene and unclouded as the day. He Seem’d to me to enjoy a Tryumph over me. Methought I heard him think Ay! I am fairly out and you fairly in! see which of Us will be happiest. When the Ceremony was over he came and made me a visit and cordially congratulated me  
  
and wished my Administration might be happy Successful and honourable.  
It is now Settled that I am to go into his House. It is whispered that he intends to take french Lave tomorrow. I shall write you, as fast as We proceed.  
My Chariot is finished and I made my first appearance in it Yesterday. It is Simple but elegant enough. My horses are young but clever.  
In the Chamber of the House of Representatives, was a Multitude as great as the Space could contain, and I believe Scarcely a dry Eye but Washingtons. The Sight of the Sun Setting full orbut and another rising tho less Splendid, was a novelty.  
C. J. Elsworth administered the oath and with great Energy. Judges Cushing, Wilson and Iredell were present. Many Ladies.  
I had not Slept well the night before and did not sleep well the night after. I was unwell and I did not know whether I Should get through or not— I did however. How the Business was received I know not, only I have been told that Mason the Treaty publisher Said We should loose nothing by the Change for he never heard such a Speech in Publick in his Life.  
All Agree that taken all together it was the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.  
I am my dearest friend most / affectionately &amp; kindly your  
  
John Adams

* Philadelphia, 5th March, 11911.  
  
* My dearest Friend,—Your dearest friend never had a more trying  
day than yesterday. A solemn scene it was indeed, and it was made more  
affecting to me by the presence of the General, whose countenance was  
as serene and unclouded as theday. Heseemed to me to enjoy a triumph  
overme. Methought I heard him say, “ Ay! I am fairly out and you  
fairly in! See which of us will be happiest.” When the ceremony  
was over, he came and made me a visit, and cordially congratulated me,  
a wished my administration might be happy, successful, and honour-  
able.  
  
‘It is now settled that I am to go into his house. It is whispered that  
he intends to take French leave to-morrow. I shall write you as fast as  
we proceed. My chariot is finished, and I made my first appearance in  
it yesterday. It is simple, but elegant enough. My horses are young,  
  
but clever.  
  
* In the chamber of the House of Representatives was a multitude as  
great as the space could contain, and I believe scarcely a dry eye—but  
Washington’s. The sight of the sun setting full orbed, and another  
rising, though less splendid, was a novelty. Chief Justice Ellsworth  
administered the oath, and with great energy. Judges Cushing, Wilson,  
and Iredell were present. Many ladies, I had not slept well the night  
before, and did not sleep well the night after. I was unwell, and did  
not know whether I should get through or not. I did, however. How  
the business was received I know not, only I have been told that Mason,  
the treaty publisher, said we should lose nothing by the change, for he  
never heard such a speech in public in his life.  
  
* All agree that, taken altogether, it was the sublimest thing ever ex-  
hibited in America, I am, my dearest friend, most affectionately and  
kindly yours,
