er. The context of each note is summarized in brackets.  
  
March, 1774  
&lt;Trade is the intercourse between nations and individuals; gain is the end to which all its methods are directed.&gt;  
In Transactions of Trade, it is not to be supos’d, that like Gaming, what one Party gains the other must necessarily lose. The Gain to each may be equal. If A had more Corn than he can consume, but wants Cade; and B has more Catle, but wants Corn; an Exchange is Gain to each: hereby the comon Stock of Comforts in Life, is increas’d.   
&lt;If restrictive laws were everywhere abandoned, trade would thrive in those countries where geography, climate, and industrious inhabitants provided the wherewithal to supply real and ideal wants.&gt;  
When Princes make war by prohibiting Comerce, each may hurt himself, as much as his Enemy. Traders, who by their Business are promoting the comon Good of Mankind, as wel as Farmers, and Fishermen, who labor for the Subsistence of al, shou’d never be interupted, or molested in their Busines; but enjoy the Protection of al in the Time of War, as wel as in Time of Peace.  
This Policy, those we are pleas’d to cal Barbarians, have, in a great Measure, adopted: for the trading Subjects of any Power, with whom the Emperor of Moroco may be at War, are not liable to Capture, when within Sight of his Land, going or coming; and have otherwise fre Liberty to trade and reside in his Dominions.  
As a Maritime Power, we presume it is not thought right, that Great Britain shou’d grant such Fredom, except partialy: as in the Case of War with France, when Tobaco is alow’d to be sent thither under the Sanction of Pasports.  
&lt;Real wants are food and drink, clothing, fuel, and habitation; any wealth beyond what is needed to procure these essentials is used for ideal wants, or luxuries. The source of wealth is land and industry, and the state must nourish both.&gt;  
Al that live must be subsisted. Subsistence costs something. He that is industrios produces by his Industry, something that is an Equivalent, and pays for his Subsistence. He is therefore no Charge, or Burden, to Society. The Indolent are an Expence, uncompensated.  
There can be no Doubt but al Kinds of Employment that can be folow’d without Prejudice from Interuptions; Work that can be taken up, and laid down, often in a Day, without Damage; such as Spining, Kniting, Weaving, &amp;c. are highly advantageous to a Comunity: because, in them, may be colected al the Produce of those Fragments of Time, that ocur in Family Busines, between the constant and necesary Parts of it, that usualy ocupy Females; as the Time between rising, and preparing Breakfast; between Breakfast, and preparing for Diner, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Amount of al these Fragments, is, in the Course of a Year, very considerable to a single Family; to a State proportionably. Highly profitable therefore it is, in this Case also, to folow that divine Direction, Gather up the Fragments that nothing be lost. Lost Time is lost Subsistence; it is therefore lost Treasure.  
Hereby in several Familys, many Yards of Linen have been produc’d from the Employment of these Fragments only, in one Year, tho’ such Familys were just the same in Number as when not so employ’d.  
It was an excelent saying of a certain Chinese Emperor, I wil, if posible, have no Idlenes in my Dominions; for if there be one Man idle, some other Man must sufer Cold and Hunger. We take this Emperor’s Meaning to be, that the Labor due to the Public, by each Individual, not being perform’d by the Indolent, and necesary to furnish his Subsistence, must naturaly fal to the share of others, who must thereby sufer.  
&lt;Only a change in the habits of the opulent can decrease the importation of luxuries;

&gt;  
In Fact, the Produce of other Countrys can hardly be obtain’d, unles by Fraud or Rapine, without giving the Produce of our Land or our Industry in Exchange for them. If we have Mines of Gold and Silver, Gold and Silver may then be cal’d the Produce of our Land. If we have not, we can only fairly obtain those Metals by giving for them the Produce of our Land or Industry. When we have them, they are then only that Produce or Industry in another Shape; which we may give, if the Trade requires it, and our other Produce wil not suit, in Exchange for the Produce of some other Country that furnishes what we have more Ocasion for, or more Desire. When we have, to an inconvenient Degre, parted with our Gold and Silver, our Industry is stimulated afresh to procure more; that by its Means we may contrive to procure the same Advantage.  
&lt;The acquisitive instinct drives the rich man to put his riches to full use; hunger drives the poor man to put his labor to full use. The wise government must provide sufficient provisions for man and beast in order to sustain industry.&gt;  
The comon People do not work for Pleasure generaly; but from Necesity. Cheapnes of Provisions makes them more idle; les Work is then done; it is then more in demand proportionaly, and of course the Price rises. Dearnes of Provisions obliges the Manufacturer to work more Days and more Hours: thus more Work is done than equals the usual Demand; of course it becomes cheaper, and the Manufactures in Consequence.  
&lt;Keeping bullion and coin at home does not promot

e it was needed to pay for imports.&gt;  
Cou’d Spain and Portugal have succeded in executing their foolish Laws for “hedging in the Cuckow,” as Locke cals it, and have kept at Home al their Gold and Silver; those Metals wou’d, by this Time, have been of litle more Valu than so much Lead or Iron. Their Plenty wou’d have lesen’d their Valu. We see the Foly of these Edicts; but are not our own prohibitory and restrictive Laws that are profesedly made with Intention to bring a Balance in our Favor from our Trade with Foreign Nations to be paid in Mony, and Laws to prevent the Necesity of exporting that Mony, which, if they cou’d be thoroughly executed, wou’d make Mony as plenty, and of as litle Valu; I say are not such Laws akin to those Spanish Edicts; Folys of the same Family?  
&lt;Government should consider whether any proposed regulation of trade promotes the general good, and should seek information not only from those directly concerned but also from those with theoretical knowledge.&gt;  
Perhaps, in general, it wou’d be beter if Government medled no farther with Trade, than to protect it, and let it take its Cours. Most of the Statutes, or Acts, Edicts, Arets and Placaarts of Parliaments, Princes, and States, for regulating, directing, or restraining of Trade; have, we think, been either political Blunders, or Jobbs obtain’d by artful Men, for private Advantage, under Pretence of public Good. When Colbert asembled some wise old Merchants of France; and desir’d their Advice and Opinion, how he cou’d best serve and promote Comerce; their Answer, after Consultation, was, in three Words only, Laissez nous faire. Let us alone. It is said, by a very solid Writer of the same Nation, that he is wel advanc’d in the Science of Politics, who knows the ful Force of that Maxim Pas trop gouverner: Not to govern too strictly. Which, perhaps, wou’d be of more Use when aply’d to Trade, than in any other public Concern. It were therefore to be wish’d, that Comerce were as fre between al the Nations of the World, as it is between the several Countys of England: so wou’d al, by mutual Comunication, obtain more Enjoyments. Those Countys do not ruin one another by Trade; neither wou’d the Nations. No Nation was ever ruin’d by Trade; even, seemingly, the most disadvantageous.  
Wherever desirable Superfluitys are imported, Industry is excited; and thereby Plenty is produc’d. Were only Necesarys permited to be purchas’d, Men wou’d work no more than was necesary, for that Purpose.  
  
&lt;France has recently changed its policy to permit internal free trade in grain and export in French bottoms. Now that other nations are abandoning destructive restrictions we must look to our essential interests.&gt;  
In Inland high Countrys, remote from the Sea, and whose Rivers are smal, runing from the Country, not to it, as is the Case of Switzerland, great Distres may arise from a Cours of bad Harvests, if public Granarys are not provided, and kept wel stor’d. Antiently too, before Navigation was so general; Ships so plenty; and comercial Conections so wel establish’d; even Maritim Countrys might be ocasionaly distres’d, by bad Crops. But such is now the Facility of Comunication between those Countrys, that an unrestrain’d Comerce can scarce ever fail of procuring a Suficiency for any of them. If indeed any Government is so imprudent, as to lay its Hands on imported Corn; forbid its Exportation; or compel its Sale, at limited Prices; there, the People, may sufer some Famin, from Merchants avoiding their Ports. But wherever Comerce is known to be always fre, and the Merchant absolute Master of his Comodity, as in Holand, there wil always be, a reasonable Suply.  
When an Exportation of Corn takes Place, ocasion’d by a higher Price in some Foreign Country, it is comon to raise a Clamor, on the Suposition that we shal thereby produce a domestic Famin. Then folows a Prohibition; founded on the imaginary Distres of the Poor. The Poor, to be sure, if in Distres, shou’d be reliev’d; but if the Farmer cou’d have a high Price for his Corn, from the foreign Demand; must he, by a Prohibition of Exportation, be compel’d to take a low Price, not of the Poor only, but of every one that eats Bread, even the richest? The Duty of relieving the Poor is incumbent on the Rich; but, by this Operation, the whole Burden of it is laid on the Farmer; who is to relieve the Rich, at the same Time. Of the Poor, too, those who are maintain’d by the Parishes, have no Right to claim this Sacrifice of the Farmer: as, while they have their Alowance, it makes no Diference to them, whether Bread be cheap, or dear.  Those working Poor, who now mind Busines only five or four Days in the Week, if Bread shou’d be so dear, as to oblige them to work the whole six, requir’d by the Comandment, do not seem to be agriev’d, so as to have a Right to public Redres. There wil, then, remain, comparativly, only a few Familys in every District; who, from Sicknes, or a great Number of Children, wil be so distres’d, by a high Price of Corn, as to need Relief: and these shou’d be taken Care of, by particular Benefactions, without restraining the Farmers Profit.  
Those who fear, that Exportation may so far drain the Country of Corn, as to starve ourselves; fear, what never did, nor ever can, hapen. They may, as wel, when they view the Tide ebing towards the Sea, fear, that al the Water wil leave the river. The Price of Corn, like Water, wil find its own Level. The more we export, the dearer it becomes at Home. The more is receiv’d Abroad, the cheaper it becomes there, and as soon as these Prices are equal, the Exportation stops of Cours. As the Seasons vary in diferent Countrys, the Calamity of a bad Harvest, is never universal. If then, al Ports were always open, and al Comerce fre; every Maritim Country wou’d generaly eat Bread at the medium Price, or Average, of al the diferent Harvests; which wou’d probably be more equal, than we can make it, by our artificial Regulations; and therefore, a more steady Encoragement to Agriculture: The Nations wou’d al have Bread at this middle Price; and that Nation, which at any Time, inhumanly, refuses to relieve the Distreses of another Nation, deserves no Compasion, when in Distres itself

Ou the Employment of Time, and on Indo­

By Doctor FRANKLIN.  
LL that live mult be subsisted.  
A Subfiftance costs something. He  
that is industrious, produces, by bis in­  
dustry, something that is an equivalent,  
and pays for his subsistence : he is there­  
fore no chargeor burden to society. The  
indolent are an expense uncompensated.  
There can be no doubt but all kinds  
of employment that can be followed  
without prejudice from interruptions,  
work that can be taken up &amp; laid down,  
often in a day, without damage (such  
as spinning, knitting, weaving, &amp;c.)  
are highly advantageous to a commu­  
nity ; because in them may be colletted  
all the produce of those fragments of  
time, that occur in family business, be­  
tween the constant and necessary parts  
of it, that usually occupy females ; as  
the time between rising and preparing  
for breakfaft, between breakfaft and  
preparing for dinner, &amp;c. &amp;c. The  
amount (_)f all these fragme‘nts is, in the  
  
course of a year, very considerable to a  
single family—to a state proportiona­  
bly. Highly profitable therefore it is,  
in this case also, to follow that divine  
dire&amp;ion, ‘¢ Gather up the fragments,  
that nothing be loft”’. Loft time is loft  
subsistence ; it is therefore loft treasure.  
Hereby, in several families, many  
yards of linen have been produced from  
the employment of those fragments on­  
ly, in one year ; though such families  
were just the fame in number as when  
not so employed.

Perhaps, in general, it would be bet*  
ter it government meddled no farther  
with tiade, than to protect it, and let  
it take its course. Most of the statures  
or acts, edicts, arrets and placarls of  
parliaments, pYinces, and states, for  
regulating, directing or restraining of  
| trade, have, I think, been either politi­  
cal blunders, or jobs obtained by artful  
men for private advantage, under pre  
tence of public good.—When Colbert  
assembled some wise old merchants of  
France, and desired their advise and  
opinion how could best serve and  
, promote commerce, their answer, after  
consultation, was in three words only,  
—Let us aJone. It is said by a very  
solid writer of the same nation that he  
is well advanced in the science of poli­  
tics, who knows the full force of that  
maxim,—not to govern loo stricllv,^  
w hich, perhaps, would be of more use  
when applied to trade, than in any other  
public concern. It were, therefore, to  
be wished, that commerce were as  
jTree between all the nations cf the  
world, as it ii between the several coun­  
ties of England, so would all, by mutual  
communication, obtain more enjoy­

each other by trade ; neither would the  
nations. No nation was ever mined

‘ WHEN an exportation of corn takes place, octasioned bya  
higher price in some foreign countries, it is common to raise a cl2-  
mour, on the supposition, that we shall thereby produce a domestic  
famine. ‘Then, follows a prohibition, founded on the imaginary  
distress of the poor. The poor, to be sure, if in distress, should  
be relieved: but, if the farmer could have a high price for his  
corn, from the foreign demand, must he, by a prohibition of ¢x-  
portation, be compelled to take a low price, not of the poor only,  
but of every one.that eats bread, even the richest? The duty of

tained by the parishes, have no right to claim this sacrifice of the  
farmer; as, while they have their allowance, it makes no differ-  
ence to them, whether bread be cheap or dear. Those working  
poor, who now mind business only five or four days in the week,  
if bread should be so dear, as to oblige them to work the whole  
siz required by the commandment, do not seem to be aggrieved,  
so as to have a right to public redress. There will then remain,  
comparatively; only a few families in every district, who, from sick-  
ness, old age, or a great number of children, will be so distressed  
by a high price of corn, as to need relief: and these should  
be taken care of by particular benefactions, without restraining  
the farmer’s profit.  
  
‘ Those who fear that exportation may so far drain the country  
of corn as to starve ourselves, fear what never did, nor never can  
happen. They may as well, when they view the tide ebbing to-  
wards the sea, fear that all the water will leave the river. The  
price of corn, like water, will find its level. ‘The more we export,  
the dearer it becomes at home: the more that is received abroad,  
the cheaper it becomes there; and as soon as these prices are  
equal, the exportation stops of course. As the seasons vary in  
different countries, the calamity of a bad harvest is never univer-  
sal. If then, all ports were always open, and all commerce free ;  
every maritime country would generally eat bread at the medium  
price, or average, of all the harvests: which would probably be  
more equal than we can make it by our artificial regulations, and  
therefore a more steady encouragement to agriculture. The na-  
tion would all have bread at this middle price ; and that nation  
which at any time inhumanly refuses to relieve the distresses  
of ~seaw nation, deserves no compassion when in distress  
itself —_

In inland high countries, remote from the sea, and whose  
rivers are small, running from the country, and not to it, as  
1s the case with Switzerland ; great distress may arise from  
a course of bad harvests, if public granaries are not provided  
and kept well stored. Anciently, too, before navigation was  
so general, ships so plenty, and commercial transactions so  
weil established ; even maritime countries might be occasi-  
onally distressed by bad crops. But such is now the facility  
of communication between those countries, that an unrestrain-  
edcommerce can scarce ever fail of procuring a sufficiency  
for any of them. If indeed any government is so imprudent  
as to lay its hands on imported corn, forbid its exportation, or  
compel its sale at limited prices, there the people may sutfer  
some famine from merchants avoiding their ports, But wher-  
ever commerce is known to be always free, and the merchant  
absolute master of his commodity, as in Holland, there will  
always be a reasonable supply.  
  
When an exportation of corn takes place, occasioned by a  
higher price in some foreign countries, it is common to raise  
aclamor, on the supposition that we shall thereby produce  
a domestic famine. ‘Then follows a prohibition, founded on  
the imaginary distresses of the poor, The poor, to be sure, if  
in distress, should be relieved; but if the tte could have  
a high price for his corn from the foreign demand, must he by  
a prohibition of exportation be compelled to take a low price,  
not of the poor only, but of every one that eats bread, even  
the richest? The duty of relieving the poor is incumbent on  
the rich; but by this operation the whole burden of itis laid  
on the farmer, who is to relieve the rich at the same time.  
Of the poor, too, those who are maintained by the parishes  
have no right to claim this sacrifice of the farmer; as while  
they have their allowance, it makes no difference to them,  
whether bread be cheap or dear. Those working poor, who  
now mind business only five or four days in the ont, if bread  
should be so dear as to oblige them to work the whole siz re=  
quired by the commandment, do not seem to be aggrieved,  
so as to have a right to public redress. ‘There will then re-  
main, comparatively, only a few families in every district,  
who, from sickness or a great number of children, will be so  
distressed by a high price of corn, as to need relief; and these  
should be taken care of by particular benefactions, without  
restraining the farmer’s profit.  
  
Those who fear that exportation may so far drain the  
country of corn, as to starve ourselves, fear what never did,  
nor never can happen. They may as well, when they view  
the tide ebbing towards the sea, fear that all the water will  
leave the river. The price of corn, like water, will find its  
own level. ‘The more we export, the dearer it becomes at  
home ; the more is received abroad, the cheaper it becomes  
there ; and, as soon as these prices are equal, the exporta-  
tion stops of course. As the seasons vary in different coun-  
tries, the calamity of a bad harvest is never universal, If,  
then, all ports were always open, and all commerce free,  
every maritime country would generally eat bread at the me-  
dium price, or average of all the harvests ; which would pro-  
bably be more equal than we can make it by our artificial re  
gulations, and therefore a more steady encouragement to  
agriculture. The nation would all have bread at this middle  
price: and that nation, which at any time inhumanly refuses  
to relieve the distresses of another nation, deserves no come  
passion when in distress itself

The common people do not work for pleasure generally,

more idle ; less work is then done, it is then more in demand

W poy in general, it would be better if government med-  
died no farther with trade, than to protect it, and let it take its  
course. Most of the statutes or acts, edicts, or arrests, and  
placarts of parliaments, princes, and states, for regulating,

political blunders, or jobs obtained by artful men for private  
advantage under pretence of public good. When Colbert

three words only, Laissez nous faire ; ‘ Let us alone,—It is  
said by a very solid writer of the same nation, that he is well  
advanced in the science of politics, who knows the full force  
of that maxim, Pas trop gowverner, ‘ not to govern too much ;’  
which, perhaps, would be of more use when applied to trade,  
than in any other public concern. It were therefore to be  
wished, that commerce were as free between all the nations  
of the world as it is between the several counties of Eng-  
Jan@; so would all, by mutual communications, obtain more  
enjoyments, Those counties do not ruin each’ other by  
trade, neither would the nations. No nation was ever ruined  
by trade, even, seemingly the most disadvantageous.  
  
Whenever desirable superfluities are imported, industry is  
excited, and thereby plenty is produced. Were only neces-  
  
  
  
saries permitted to be purchased, men would work no more  
than was necessary for that purpose.

When princes make war by prohibiting commerce, each  
may hurt himself as much as his enemy. Traders, who b  
their business are promoting the common good of mankind,  
as well as farmers and fishermen, who labor for the subsis-  
tence of all, should never be interrupted or molested in their  
business, but enjoy the protection of all in the time of war,  
as well as in the time of peace.  
  
This policy, those we are pleased to call barbarians have,  
in a great measure, adopted : for the trading subjects of any  
power, with whom the emperor of Morocco may be at war,  
are not liable to capture when within sight of his land, going  
or coming; and have otherwise free liberty to trade and re-  
side in his dominions.  
  
As a maritime power, we presume it is not thought right

ly, as in the case of war with France, when tobacco is allow-

All that live must be subsisted. Subsistence  
costs something, He that is industrious pro­  
duces, by his industry, something that is an  
equivalent, and pays for his subsistence. He is,  
therefore, no charge or burden to society. The  
indolent are an expense uncompensated. There  
can be no doubt but all kinds of employtni nt  
that can be followed without prejudice from in­  
terruptions ; work that can be taken up and laid  
down often in a day, without damage (such as  
spinning, knitting, weaving, &amp;c.);—are highly  
advantageous to a community ; because iu them  
may be collected all the produce of those frag­  
nients-of time, that occur in family business, be­  
tween the constant and necessary parte of it, that  
Usually occupy females, as the time between ris  
ing and preparing for breakfast, between break­  
fast and preparing for dinner, &amp;c.  
The amount of all these fragments is, in the  
course of a year, very considerable to a single  
family ;to a State, proportionally. Highly prof­  
itable, therefore, it is, in this ease also, to follow  
that Divine direction. &quot;Gather up the fragments,  
that nothing be lost.&quot; Lost time is lost subsist­  
ence; it is therefore lost treasure.  
Hereby in several families, many vards of linen  
have been produced from the employment of  
these fragments only, in one year, though such  
families were just the same in number as when  
not -o employed.  
It was an excellent saying of a certain Chinese  
Emperor, •*! will, if possible, have no idleness in  
my dominions, for if there be one man idle, some  
other man must suffer cold or-hungrr.&quot;
