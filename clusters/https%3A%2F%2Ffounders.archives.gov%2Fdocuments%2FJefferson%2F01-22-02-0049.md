Sir  
Maryland. Baltimore County. Near Ellicotts Lower Mills August 19th: 1791  
  
I am fully sensible of the greatness of that freedom which I take with you on the present occasion; a liberty which Seemed to me scarcely allowable, when I reflected on that distinguished, and dignifyed station in which you Stand; and the almost general prejudice and prepossession which is so prevailent in the world against those of my complexion.  
I suppose it is a truth too well attested to you, to need a proof here, that we are a race of Beings who have long laboured under the abuse and censure of the world, that we have long been looked upon with an eye of contempt, and that we have long been considered rather as brutish than human, and Scarcely capable of mental endowments.  
Sir I hope I may Safely admit, in consequence of that report which hath reached me, that you are a man far less inflexible in Sentiments of this nature, than many others, that you are measurably friendly and well disposed toward us, and that you are willing and ready to Lend your aid and assistance to our relief from those many distresses and numerous calamities to which we are reduced.  
Now Sir if this is founded in truth, I apprehend you will readily embrace every opportunity to eradicate that train of absurd and false ideas and oppinions which so generally prevails with respect to us, and that your Sentiments are concurrent with mine, which are that one universal Father hath given being to us all, and that he hath not only made us all of one flesh, but that he hath also without partiality afforded us all the Same Sensations, and endued us all  with the same faculties, and that however variable we may be in Society or religion, however diversifyed in Situation or colour, we are all of the Same Family, and Stand in the Same relation to him.  
Sir, if these are Sentiments of which you are fully persuaded, I hope you cannot but acknowledge, that it is the indispensible duty of those who maintain for themselves the rights of human nature, and who profess the obligations of Christianity, to extend their power and influence to the relief of every part of the human race, from whatever burthen or oppression they may unjustly labour under, and this I apprehend a full conviction of the truth and obligation of these principles should lead all to.  
Sir, I have long been convinced, that if your love for your Selves, and for those inesteemable laws which preserve to you the rights of human nature, was founded on Sincerity, you could not but be Solicitous, that every Individual of whatsoever rank or distinction, might with you equally enjoy the blessings thereof, neither could you rest Satisfyed, short of the most active diffusion of your exertions, in order to their promotion from any State of degradation, to which the unjustifyable cruelty and barbarism of men may have reduced them.  
Sir I freely and Chearfully acknowledge, that I am of the African race, and in that colour which is natural to them of the deepest dye, and it is under a Sense of the most profound gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the universe, that I now confess to you, that I am not under that State of tyrannical thraldom, and inhuman captivity, to which too many of my brethren are doomed; but that I have abundantly tasted of the fruition of those blessings which proceed from that free and unequalled liberty with which you are favoured and which I hope you will willingly allow you have received from the immediate hand of that Being, from whom proceedeth every good and perfect gift.  
Sir, Suffer me to recall to your mind that time in which the Arms and tyranny of the British Crown were exerted with every powerful effort in order to reduce you to a State of Servitude, look back I intreat you on the variety of dangers to which you were exposed, reflect on that time in which every human aid appeared unavailable, and in which even hope and fortitude wore the aspect of inability to the Conflict, and you cannot but be led to a Serious and grateful Sense of your miraculous and providential preservation; you cannot but acknowledge, that the present freedom and tranquility which  you enjoy you have mercifully received, and that it is the peculiar blessing of Heaven.  
This Sir, was a time in which you clearly saw into the injustice of a State of Slavery, and in which you had just apprehensions of the horrors of its condition, it was now Sir, that your abhorrence thereof was so excited, that you publickly held forth this true and invaluable doctrine, which is worthy to be recorded and remember’d in all Succeeding ages. “We hold these truths to be Self evident, that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happyness.”  
Here Sir, was a time in which your tender feelings for your selves had engaged you thus to declare, you were then impressed with proper ideas of the great valuation of liberty, and the free possession of those blessings to which you were entitled by nature; but Sir how pitiable is it to reflect, that altho you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of those rights and privileges which he had conferred upon them, that you should at the Same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren under groaning captivity and cruel oppression, that you should at the Same time be found guilty of that most criminal act, which you professedly detested in others, with respect to yourselves.  
Sir, I suppose that your knowledge of the situation of my brethren is too extensive to need a recital here; neither shall I presume to prescribe methods by which they may be relieved; otherwise than by recommending to you and all others, to wean yourselves from these narrow prejudices which you have imbibed with respect to them, and as Job proposed to his friends “Put your Souls in their Souls stead,” thus shall your hearts be enlarged with kindness and benevolence toward them, and thus shall you need neither the direction of myself or others in what manner to proceed herein.  
And now, Sir, altho my Sympathy and affection for my brethren hath caused my enlargement thus far, I ardently hope that your candour and generosity will plead with you in my behalf, when I make known to you, that it was not originally my design; but that having taken up my pen in order to direct to you as a present, a copy of an Almanack which I have calculated for the Succeeding year, I was unexpectedly and unavoidably led thereto.  
This calculation, Sir, is the production of my arduous Study in this my advanced Stage of life; for having long had unbounded  desires to become acquainted with the Secrets of nature, I have had to gratify my curiosity herein thro my own assiduous application to Astronomical Study, in which I need not to recount to you the many difficulties and disadvantages which I have had to encounter.  
And altho I had almost declined to make my calculation for the ensuing year, in consequence of that time which I had allotted therefor being taking up at the Federal Territory by the request of Mr. Andrew Ellicott, yet finding myself under Several engagements to printers of this state to whom I had communicated my design, on my return to my place of residence, I industriously apply’d myself thereto, which I hope I have accomplished with correctness and accuracy, a copy of which I have taken the liberty to direct to you, and which I humbly request you will favourably receive, and altho you may have the opportunity of perusing it after its publication, yet I chose to send it to you in manuscript previous thereto, that thereby you might not only have an earlier inspection, but that you might also view it in my own hand writing.—And now Sir, I shall conclude and Subscribe my Self with the most profound respect your most Obedient humble Servant,  
  
Benjamin Banneker

Maryland, Baltimore county, near Ellicktt’s Lower Mills, Aug. 09, 1491,  
SiR,  
  
I AM fully convinced of the greatnefs of that freedom which I take  
with you, on the prefent occafion: a liberty which feemed to m  
fcarcely allowable, when I reflected on that diltinguifhed and dignig.  
ed {tation in which you ftand; and the almoft general prejudice and  
prepofleffion which is fo prevalent in the world again{t thofe of ny  
complexion. |  
  
I fuppofe it is a truth, too well attefted to you to need a proof here,  
that we area race of beings who have long laboured under the abuf  
and cenfure of the world ; that we have long been looked upon with  
an eye of contempt, confidered rather as brutish than human, and  
fcarcely capable of mental endowments.  
  
Ihope I may fafely admit, in confequence of that report whic  
hath reached me, that you are a man far lefs inflexible in fentimens  
of this nature, than many others; that you are meafurably friendly  
and well difpofed towards us ; and that you are willing and ready to  
lend your aid and affiftance to our relief, from thofe many diftrefles  
and numerous calamities to which we are reduced.  
  
Now, fir, if this be founded in truth, | apprehend you will readily  
embrace every opportunity, to eradicate that train of abfurd and falle  
ideas avd opinions which fo generally prevail in refpe&amp; to us; and  
that your fentiments are concurrent with mine, which are, that one  
univerfal father gave being to us all ; and that he hagh not only made  
us of one flefh, but that he hath aifo, without partiality, afforded us  
all the fame fenfations, and endued us all with the fame faculties, and  
that, however variable we may be, in fociety or religion, however di-  
verfified in fituation or colour, we are all of the fame family, and ftand  
in the fame relation to him.  
  
if thefe are fentiments of which you are fully perfuaded, I hope you  
cannot but acknowledge, that it is the indilpentible duty of thote who  
maintain for themfelves the rights of human nature, and who _profels  
the obligations of chriflianity, toextend their power and influence to  
the relict of every part of the human race, from whatever burthen or  
oppreflion they may unjultly labour under ; and this, | apprebend, a  
full conviction of the trath and obligation of thefe principles fhould  
Jead us all to.  
  
Sir, | have long been convinced, that if your love for yourfelves,  
and thofe ineflimable laws which preferve to you the rights of human  
nature, was founded on fincerity, you could not but be folicitous, that  
every individual, of whatever rank or diftin@ion, might with you  
equally enjoy the bleflings thereof; neither could you reft fatished,  
fhort of the moft active dilfufion of your exertions, in order to their  
promotion from any flate of degradation, to which the unjuftifabie  
cruelty and barbari(m of men may hiave reduced them.

lfreely and cheerfully acknowledge, that I am of the African race,  
and inthat colour which is natural to them of the deepelt dye; and it  
js under a fenfe of the moft profound gratitude to the Supreme Raler  
of the univerfe, that | now confefs to you, that lam not under that ftate  
of tyrannical thraldom, and inkuman captivity, to which too many of  
my brethren are doomed, but that Ihave abundantly tafted of the  
ruition of thofe bleflings, which proceed from that free and unequal-  
ed liberty with which you are favoured, and which I hope you will  
willingly allow you have received from the immediate hand of that  
Being, from whom proceedeth every good and perfect gift  
  
Suffer me to recal to your mind that time, in whici the arms and  
tyranny of the Britih crown were exerted, with every powerful ef-  
fort, in order to reduce you to a {tate of fervitude; look back, | in-  
treat you, on the variety of dangers to which you were expel} s0-  
fet on the time in which every human aid appeared unavailable, and  
in which even hope and fortitude wore the afpeét of inability to the  
conflict, and you cannot bot be led to a ferious and grateful fenfe of  
your miraculous and providential prefervation; you cannot but ac-  
knowledge, that the prefent freedom and tranquility which you enjoy,  
you have &quot;mercifully received, and that it is the peculiar blefing of  
heaven.  
  
This, fir, was a time when you clearly faw into the injuftice of a  
flate of flavery, and in which you had jult apprekenfions of the hor-  
rors of its condition:—it was now that your abhorrence thereof was  
fo excited, that you publicly held forth this true and invaluable doc-  
trine, Which is worthy to be recorded and remembered in all fucceed-  
ingages. “* We hold thefe truths to be felf-evidenr, that all men  
are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with cer+  
tain unalienable rights, and that among thele are—life, liberty, and  
the purfuit of hatppinefs.”’  
  
Here was 2 time in which your tender feelings for yourfelves had  
engaged you thus to declare ; you were then imprefled with proper  
ideas of the great violation of liberty, ard the free potleflion of thofe  
bleflings to which you were entitled by nature ; but, fir, how pitiable  
isitto reflect, that, although you were fo fully convinced of the bene-  
volence of the Father of mankind, and of his equal and impartial dif-  
tribution ef thofe rights and privileges which he had conferred upon  
them, that you fhould, at the fame time, counteract his mercies, in  
detaining, by fraud and violence, fo numerous a part of my brethren,  
under groaning captivity and cruel oppreflion ; that you fhould, at  
thefame time, be found guilty of that moft criminal ad, which you pro-  
felledly detefted in others, with refpect to yourfelves.  
  
Ifuppofe that your knowledge of the fituation of my brethren  
is too extenfive to need a recital here; neither fhall 1 prefume  
te prefcribe methods by which they may be relieved, otherwife  
than by recommending to you and all others, to wean yourfelves  
from thofe narrow prejadices which you have imbibed with refped to  
them, and, as Job propoted to his friends, “ put ‘your foul in their  
fouls ftead,””, thus fhall your hearts be enlarged with kindnefs and be-  
nevolence towards them, and thus fhall you need neither the direc-  
ton of myfelf or others, in what manner te proceed herein.

And now, fir, although my fympathy and affeQion for my brethrey  
hath caufed my enlargement thus far, I ardently hope that your cap.  
dour and generofity will plead with you in my behalf, when I mak,  
known to you, that itwas not originally my defign ; but having takey  
up my pen, in order to direct you, as a prefent, a copy of an almanac  
which I have calculated for the tuceeeding year, 1 was unexpectedly

will oblige a number of your readers.  
Maryland, Baltimore county, near Ellicott&#x27;s  
Lower Mills, Aug. 19, 1791. j  
To THOMAS JEFFERSON, Esq.  
Sir, tc  
1 am fully convinced of the greatness of that  
freedom which I take with yeu on the present oe­  
cafian ; a liberty which seemed to me scarcely al­  
lowable, when I refle&amp;ed on that diftingnilhed and  
dignified liation in which you Hand ; and the La!&quot; h„  
most general prejudice and prepolTeiTion which is  
so prevalent in the world against those of my com-   
plexion,  
, I suppose it a truth too well attested to you, to  
need a proof here, that we are a race of beings  
Who have long labored under the abuse and eenfure  
of the world, that we have long been looked opon  
with an eye of contempt, considered rather ar   
brutish than human, aud scarcely capable of mental  
endowments.  
I hope 1 may fafelj admit, in confequejice of  
that repott which has reached me, that you are a   
man far less inflexible in sentiments of this nature ,  
than many others, that you are measurably friend­  
ly and well disposed towards us, and that you arc  
willing and ready to lend your aid and afliflance to C°  
our relief from those many diftrcfTes and numerous   
calamities to which we arc reduced.   
Now, fir, if this Isr founded in truth, I appre- ■  
heod you will readily embrace every opportunity, .  
to eradicate that train of absurd and falfe ideas and  
opinions which so generally prevail in [refpedt to m  
t us, and that your lentiments are concurrent with  
3 mine, which are, that one universal Father hath  
given being to us all, and that he hath not only  
made us of one fieih, but that he hath also, with- 0  
out partiality, afforded us all the fame fenfatiens,  
and that however variable &#x27;we may be in society or  
religion&#x27;; however diverfified in situation or colour, w  
we are all of the fame family, and stand in the fame  
relation to him.  
If these are sentiments of which you are fully  
pe fuaded, I hope you cannot but acknowledge,  
that it is the irdifpfafible duty of those who main­  
tain for themselves the&gt; rights of human nature,  
and who prefefs the obligations of christianity, to  
extend their power and influence to the relief of i,  
a every part of the human taee, from whatever bur­  
then or oppreflion they may unjustly labor under,  
c and this I apprehend a full conviction of the truth &#x27;  
. and obligation of these principles should lead us °  
&#x27; all to. &quot;  
&#x27; Sir, 1 have long been convinced, that if your c  
1 love for yourfelve6, and for those inestimable laws V&#x27;  
i, which preserve to you the rights of human nature, f  
was founded on sincerity, you could not but be fe­  
licitous, that every individual of whatever rank or  
diftindton, might with you equally enjoy the blef- [&#x27;  
. sings thereof; neither could you reft fatisficd, fhsrt &#x27;  
Of the raeft adive diffufion of your exertions, in  
order to their promotion from any state of degra- n  
e dation, to which the unjullifiable cruelty and bar- 3  
5 barifm of men may have reduced them.   
I freely and chearfully acknowledge, that lam ,  
of the African race, and in that colour which is  
natural to them of the deepest dye, and it is un­  
der a sense of the most profound gratitude to the  
supreme ruler of the universe, that I noW confefs  
• to you, that lam not under that state of tyranni­  
cal thraldom, and inhuman captivity, to which toa  
many efyny btethren are doomed, but that I have  
abundantly tailed of the fruition of those blellingg,  
a which proceed from that free and unequalled liber­  
g ty with which you are favored, and which 1 hope   
•f you will willingly allow you have received from the  
immediate hand of that being, from whom pro- I  
i- ceedeth every good and perfect gift. p  
y Suffer me to recall to your mind that time, in v  
* which the arms and tyranny of the British crown ti  
were exerted with every powerful effort in order to  
reduce you to a state qf Servitude ; look back I en- e  
treat you on the variety of dangers to which you n  
ir were exposed 5 reflect on the time in which every 0  
d human aid appeared unavailable, and in which even ii  
hope and fortitude wore the afpeft of inability to t  
e, the confli£t, and you cannot but be led to a fcrioue p  
3&#x27; and gtateful sense of your miraculous and provi- v

cl that the present freedom and tranquillity which you ti  
1. enjoy, you have mercifully received, apd that it is fc  
&quot; the peculiar blessing of heaven. &#x27; v  
fe This fir was a time in which you clearly saw into t  
the injustice of a state of slavery, and in wliitb you n  
had just apprehensions of the horror of its condi­  
tion,—it was now that your abhorrence thereof was q  
so excited, that you publicly held fotth this try* n  
and invaluable doftrinc, which is worthy to be re- c  
corded and remembered in all succeeding ages, t  
&quot;We hold ttoefe truths to be felf-evident, that all f  
men are created equal, that they are endowed by a  
s, their creator with certain unalienable rights, and f  
a- that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit 2  
*e of happiness.&quot; r  
Here was a time in which your tender feelings a  
for yourselves had engaged you thus to declare ; t  
yon weri then impteffed witli proper ideas of the  
i re*t valuation of liberty, and the free possession f  
w of taofe fc&gt;l«flingivt&lt;) which jrou were entitled by t  
A  
  
nature; but, Gi% how pitiable is it to reflefi, that if  
although&#x27;you were so fully convinced of the bent- c(  
volence of the father of mankind, and of his e- c&lt;  
qual and impartial distribution of thtfe rights and ai  
privileges which he had conferred upon them, that j d  
you should at the fame time counteract his merce», I  
in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a V  
part of my brethren under groaning captivity and p  
cruel oppreflion, that you fliould at the fame time t&lt;  
be fourd guilty of that most criminal aft, which 1«  
you profeffedly detested in others, with rrfpeA to tl  
yourielves. . .  
I suppose that your knowledge of the situation h  
of my brethren is too extensive to need a recital b  
here ; neither lhall I presume to ptefcribe methods li  
by which they may be relieved , otherwise than by h  
recommending to you and all others, to wean youi- h  
selves from those Marrow prejudices which you have fc  
imbibed with refpea to them, and proposed I  
to his friends, &quot; put your foul in their fouls stead&quot; ci  
—thus (hall your hearts be enlarged with kindness o:  
and benevolence towards them, and thus (hall you i.  
need neither the direction of myfelf or others in ai  
what manner to proceed herein. &#x27;I  
And now, fir, although my sympathy Sod affec- b  
tion for my brethren hath taufed my ealar£ement  
thus far, I ardently hope that your candour and l&#x27;r  
generotty will plead with you in my behalf, when b  
1 make known to you, that it was not origisally my m  
design ; but that having taken up «ny pen in order tl  
to dire&amp; to you as a prefcnt, a copy of an almanack ts  
which I hive calculated for the fuccecding year, I fr  
was anexpeftedly and unavoidably led thereto. n&lt;  
This calculation is the produftitnl of my ardu- 1  
ous study in this my advanced stage of life, (59) for ol  
having long had unbounded desires to become ae­  
quainted with the secrets of nature, I have had to tc  
gratify my curiosity herein through ray own adidu- ti  
ous application to allronomical Itudy, in which I p&#x27;  
need not recount to you the many diffievilties and 01  
disadvantages which 1 hare had to encounter.  
And although I had a&#x27;.moft declined to make my fr  
calculation for tfee lujuing year, in cantetfuenc* of m  
that time which I had altottedtheretor being taken tl  
up at the federal territory, by the request of Mr- ti

had communicated my design, on my return to my it  
place of residence, I indaftrioufly applied myfelf  
thereto, which I hope I have accomplished with tl  
correftnefa and accuracy ; a copy of which I have F  
taken the liberty to direst to you, and which 1 it  
humbly requelt you will favorably receive, and al- 1)  
though you may have the opportunity of perusing o  
it after its publication, yet 1 chose to fend it to you 1&lt;  
in manuscript previous thereto, that thereby you «  
might not only have an earlier infpe&amp;ian, but that d  
you might also view it in my own hand writing. li

quence of that report which hath reached  
me, that you are a man far less inflexible in  
sentiments of this nature than many others ;  
that you are measureably friendly and well-  
disposed towards us, and that you are ready  
and willing to lend your aid and assistance to  
our relief from those many distressed and  
numerous calamities, to which we are re-  
duced.  
  
Now, sir, if this is founded in truth, I ap-  
prehend you will readily embrace every o  
portunity to eradicate that train of absurd and  
false ideas and opirions, which so generally  
prevails with respect to us, and that your sen-  
timents are concurrent with mine, which are,  
that one universal Father hath not only made  
us all of one flesh, but that he hath given be-  
ing to us all, and that he hath also, without  
partiality, afiorded us all the same sensations,  
and endued us all with the same faculties;  
and that however variable we may be in so-  
ciety or religion, however diversified in situ-  
ation or colour, we are all of the same fa-  
mily, and stand in the same relation to  
him. ¥  
  
Sir, if these are sentiments of which you  
are fully persuaded, I hope you cannot but  
acknowledge that it is the indispensable duty  
of those who maintain for themselves the  
rights of human nature, and who profess the  
obligations of Christianity, to extend their  
power and influence to the relief of every part  
of the human race from whatever burthen or  
oppression they may unjustly labour under ;  
and this, I apprehend, a full conviction of the  
truth and obligation of these principles should  
lead all to.  
  
Sir, I have long been convinced, that if  
your love for yourselves and for those inesti-  
mable laws, which preserve to you the rights  
of human nature, was founded on sincerity,  
  
you could not but be solicitous that every in-  
dividual, of whatever rank or distinction,  
might with you equally enjoy the blessings  
thereof; neither could you rest satisfied short  
of the most active diffusion of your exertions,  
in order to their promotion from any state of  
degradation, to which the unjustifiable cru-  
elty and barbarism of men may have reduced  
them.  
  
Sir, I freely and cheerfully acknowledge  
that I am of the African race, and in that co-  
Jour which is natural to them, of the deepest  
dye ; and it is under a sense of the most pro-  
found gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the  
universe that I now confess to you, that I am  
not under that state of tyrannical thraldom  
and inhuman captivity, to which too many of  
my brethren are doomed, but that I have  
abundantly tasted of the fruition of those bles-  
sings which proceed from that free and une-  
qualled liberty with which you are favoured,  
and which I hope you will willingly allow you  
have received from the immediate hand of  
that Being, from whom proceedeth every good  
and perfect gift.  
  
Sir, suffer me to recall to your mind that  
time in which the arms and tyranny of the  
British crown, were exerted with every pow-  
erful effort, in order to reduce you to a state  
of servitude ; look back, I entreat you, on the  
  
variety of dangers to which you were exposed ;  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
appeared unavailable, and in which even hope  
and fortitude wore the aspect of inability to  
the conflict, and you cannot but be led to a  
serious and grateful sense of your miraculous  
and providential preservation ; you cannot but  
acknowledge, that the present freedom and  
tranquillity which you enjoy, you have merci-  
fully received, and that it is the peculiar bles-  
sing of heaven.  
  
saw into the injustice of a state of slavery,  
and in which you had just apprehension of  
the horrors of its condition, it was now, sir,  
that your abhorrence thereof was so excited,  
that you publicly held forth this true and in-  
valuable doctrine, which is worthy to be re-  
corded and remembered in all succeeding  
ages: “ We hold these truths to be self-evi-  
dent, that all men are created equal, and that  
they are endowed by their Creator with cer-  
tain inalienable rights; that among these are  
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  
  
feelings for yourselves had engaged you thus  
to declare; you were then impressed with  
proper ideas of the great valuation of liberty,  
and the free possession of those blessings, to  
which you were entitled by nature; but, sir,  
how pitiable is it to reflect, that, although  
you were so fully convinced of the benevo-  
lence of the Father of mankind, and of his  
equal and impartial distribution of those rights  
and privileges which he had conferred upon  
them, that you should at the same time coun-  
teract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and  
violence so numerous a part of my brethren  
under groaning captivity and cruel oppres-  
sion; that you should at the same time be  
found guilty of that most criminal act, which  
you professedly detested in others with res

BaLTimMoRE County,  
Near Kinase ye Mills, Aug. 19th, 1791.  
Tuomas Jerrerson, Secretary of Stale:  
  
Sir :-—1 am fully sensible of the greatness of  
that freedom, which I take with you on the  
present occasion, a liberty which seemed to me  
scarcely allowable, when I reflected on that dis-  
tinguished and dignified station in which you  
  
possession which is so prevalent in the world  
against those of my complexion.  
  
I suppose it a truth too well attested to you,  
to need a proof here, that we are a race of be-  
ings who have long labored under the abuse and  
censure of the world, that we have long been  
considered rather as brutish than human, and  
scarcely capable of mental endowments. #  
  
Sir, I hope I may safely admit, in cons@fuence  
of that report which hath reached me, that you  
are a aman far Jess inflexible in sentiments of this  
nature than many others, that you are measura-  
bly friendly and well disposed towards us, and  
that you are ready and willing to lend your aid  
and assistance to our relief, from those many  
distressing and numerous calamities to which we  
are reduced.  
  
Now, Sir, if this is founded in truth, 1 ap-  
prehend you will be ready to embrace every op-  
portanity to eradicate that train of absurd and  
false ideas and opinions, which so generally pre-  
vails in respect to us, and that your sentiments |  
ate concurrent with mine, which are that one!  
universal father hath not only made us all of |  
one flesh, but that he hath given being to us all,  
and that he hath without partiality afforded us)  
the same sensations, and endowed us all with)  
the same faculties, and that however variable we  
may be in society or religion, however diversi-  
fied in situation or color, we are all of the same,  
family, and stand in the same relation to him. |  
  
Sir, if these are sentiments of which you are!  
fully persuaded, I hope you cannot but acknow!l- |  
edge, that it is the indispensable duty of those)  
who maintain forthemselves the rights _of ha-|  
man nature, and who profess the obligations of  
christianity, to extend their power and influence |  
to the relief of every part of the human race, |  
from whatever burden er oppression t  
unjustly labor under, and this [apprehend a full  
conviction of the truth and obligation of these |  
  
principles should lead all to.  
  
Sir, I have long been convinced, that if your  
love for yourselves and for those inestimable |  
Jaws, which preserve to you the rights of ha- |  
man nature, was founded on sincerity, you could  
  
  
  
not but be solicitous that every individual of |  
whatever rank or distinction, might with you |  
equally enjoy the blessings thereof, neither)  
could you rest satisfied, short of the most ac-)  
  
promotion from any state of degradation, to  
which the unjustifiable cruelty and barbarism of  
men may have reduced them.

false ideas aud opinions which so generally  
prevails with respect to us, aud that your sentiments

Sir, if these are sentiments of which you are 1

that it is the indispensable duty of those  
who maintain tor themselves the rights of human

ot Christianity, to extend tne.r power aud influence  
to the re.iel of every part of the human  
race Irotn whatever burihen or oppression they  
may unjust.y labor under, aud this, 1 apprehend,  
a lull conviction ol the truth and obligation  
of these principles should lead all to.  
Sir, 1 have long beeu couviuced that if your  
love lor yourselves, aud those inestimable laws  
which preserve to you tne rights of human nature,  
was founded on sincerity, you couid uot

Sir, 1 freely aud cheerfully acknowledge that  
[ am of the Airican race, and in that color  
which is natural to them of the deepest dye ;  
tud it is uuder a sense of the moat profound  
gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the Uuiverse  
that 1 now coufess to you that i am uot under  
that state of tyrannical thraldom and inhuman  
captivity to which too many of my brethren

which you are favored, and which 1 hope you  
will willingly allow you have receiv-d from the  
nmediate band of that being from whom pro;ee&lt;ieth  
every good and perfect gift.  
Sir, suffer me to recall to your mind that time  
n whicn the arms and tyranny of the British .  
:rown were exerted with every powerful effort  
u order to reduce you to a state of servitude ;  
ook back, I entreat you, on the variety of dangers  
to which yon were exposed ; reflect oq that  
,ime in which every human aid appeared no- 1  
ivailablt aud even hope and fortitude wore the  
ispect of iuability to conflict, aud you cannot 1  
&gt;ut be led to a serious aud grateful sense of  
rour miraculous preservation ; yon cannot but ,  
acknowledge that the present freedom and  
rauquiltty which you enjoy you have merci- .  
ully received, and that it is the peculiar bless- :  
ug of heaven.  
i&#x27;kis, sir, was a time iu which you clearly )  
aw into the injustice of a elate of slavery end  
n which you bad just apprehension of the hor- j  
ore of its oondition ; it was now, sir, that your  
ibborrence thereof was so excited that yon &lt;  
ubiioly held forth this trae and invaluable ,  
octrine, which is worthy to be recorded and  
emebered in all succeeding egee: &quot;We bold (  
bees truths to be self-evident that all men are  
reeled equal, and that they ere eodewed by i

l!5 era;  
their Creator wiiu certain inalienable rights ; !  
that among these are life, liberty, and the pur 1  
suit of happiness.&quot;  
Here, sir, was a time in which your tender  
feelings for yourselves had engaged you thus to ;  
deelare vnu were then impressed with proper  
ideas ef the great valuation of liberty and the  
free possession of those blessings to which you  
were entitled by nature: bnt, sir. how pitiable  
is it to reflect that although you were so fully  
convinced of the benevolence of the Father of  
mankind, and ot his equal and impartial distri* &#x27;  
- ? ? * a _ 1 - - L i ;  
  
outioo of tnose rigtus ana privileges wmrn ne  
h?d conferral npon them, that you should at  
the same time counteract hie mercies in detaining  
hy fraud and violence so numerous a part  
of my brethren nader groaning captivity and  
cruel oppression, that you should at the same 1  
time be found guilty of the moat criminal act,  
which yon professedly detested in others with  
respect to yourselves.  
Sir, 1 suppose that your knowledge of the  
situation of my brethren is too extensive to need  
a recital here ; neither shall I presume to pre  
scribe methods by which they may be relieved  
otherwise than by recommending to you and to  
all others to wean yourselves from those nar  
row prejudices which you have imbibed with 1  
respect to them, and as Job proposed to his  
friends, &quot; put your souls in their souls&#x27; stead,&quot; .  
thus shall yomr hearts be enlarged with kindness  
and benevolence towards them, and thu- j  
shall you need neither the direction of mysell  
or others in what manner to proceed herein.  
And now, sir, although my sympathy and  
affection for my brethren lias caused my enlarge- I  
meat thus far, I ardently hope that your can- I  
dor and generosity will plead with you it? iny  
behalf when I make known to you that it was  
not originally my design, but that having  
taken up my pen in order to direct to you na  
present a copy of niv almanuc which I have

peotedly and unavoidably led thereto.

Sir—l am fully sensible of the greatness of i  
freedom which I take with you on the present t  
occasion, a liberty which seemed to me scarce- t  
ly allowable, when I reflect on that distinguish- 1  
ed and Signified station in ”’hieh v-n t  
and the almost general prejudice and prepos- 1  
session which is so prevalent in the world £  
against those of my complexion. I suppose it t  
is a truth too well attested to you to need a i  
proof here, that we are a race of beings who t  
have long labored under thoabu3eand censure y  
of the world; that we have long been coDsid- £  
ered rather as brutish than human, aud scarce- £  
ly capable of mental endowments. i  
Sir, I hope I may safely admit, in conse- c  
quence of that report which hath reached me, i  
that you are a man far less indexible in senti- 1  
meats of this nature than many others, that -  
you are measurably friendly and well disposed 1  
towards us, and that you are ready and willing 1  
to lend your aid and assistance to our relief t  
from those many distressed and numerous ca- i  
lamities to which we are reduced. :  
Now sir, if this is founded in truth, I appre­  
hend you will readily embrace every opportu- I  
nity to eradicate that train of absurd and false 1  
ideas and opinions which so generally prevail 1  
with respect to us, and that your sentiments t

however variable we may be in society or re­  
ligion, however diversified in situation or color, 1  
we are all of the same family, and stand in the ■  
same relation to Him. I  
Sir, if these are sentiments of which you are ;  
fully persuaded, I hope jroa cannot but ac- i  
knowledge that it is the indispensable duty of 1  
those who maintain for themselves the rights of  
human nature, and who profess the obligations  
of christiraity, to extend their power and in­  
fluence to the relief of every part of the human  
race; and whatever burden or oppression they  
may unjustly labor uuder, and this I appre­  
hend a lull conviction of the truth&#x27; and obliga­  
tion of these principles should lead all to.  
Sir, I have long been convinced, that if your  
love for yourselves and for those inestimable  
laws which preserve to you the rights of hu­  
man nature was founded on sincerity, you could  
not but be solicitous that every individual of  
whatever rank or distinction, might with you  
equally enjoy the blessings thereof; neither  
could you rest satisfied, short ol the most active  
diffusion of your exertions, in order to their  
promotion from any state ef degradation to  
which the unjustifiable cruelty and barbarism  
of men may have reduced them.  
Sir, I freely and cheerfully acknowledge that  
I am of the African race, aud in that color  
which is natural to them, of the deepest dye,  
and it is under a sense of the most profound  
gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the universe  
that I now confess to you that I am not under  
that state of tyrannical thraldom and inhuman  
captivity to which too many of my brethern  
are doomed, but that I have abundantly tasted  
of the fruition of those blessings which proceed  
from that free and unequaled liberty with  
which you are favored, and which, I hope, you  
will willingly allow, you have received from  
the immediate hand of that Being from whom  
proceedeth every good and perfect gift. •  
Sir, suffer me to recall to your mind that time  
in which the arms and tyranny of the British  
Crown were exerted with every powerful effort  
in order to reduce you to a state of servitude;  
look back, I entreat you, on the variety of dan  
gers to which you were exposed ; reflect on that  
time in which every human aid appeared un­  
available, and in which even hope and fortitude  
wore the aspect of inability to the conflict; and  
you cannot but be led to a serious and grateful  
sense of your miraculous and providential pre­  
servation; you cannot but acknowledge that  
the present freedom and tranquility which you  
enjoy, you have mercifully received, and that  
it is the peculiar blessing of heavan. This,  
Sir, was a time in which you clearly saw into  
the injustice of of slavery, and iu which  
you had just apprehension of tho horrors of its  
condition; it was now, Sir, that your abhorence  
thereof was so excited, that you publicly held  
forth this true and invaluable doctrine, which  
is worthy to bo recorded and remembered in all  
succeeding ages: “We hold these truths to be  
self-evident, that all men are created equal, and  
that they are endowed by their Creator with  
certain inalienable rights; that among these are  
life, liberty aud the pursuit of happiness.”—  
Here, Sir, was a time in which your tender  
feelings for yourselves had engaged you thus  
to declare; you were then impressed with pro­  
per ideas of the great valuation of liberty and  
the free possession of those blessings to which  
you were entitled by nature; but,Sir,how piti­  
able is it to reflect that although you were so  
fully convinced of the benevolence of the Fath­  
er ol mankind, and of his equal and impartial  
distribution ol those rights and privileges which  
he bad conferred upon them, that you should  
at the same time counteract his mercies, in de­  
taining by fraud aud violence so numerous a

calamities to which we are reduced. :  
  
“Now, sir, if this is found in truth I apprehend you will readily em-  
brace every opportunity to eradicate that train of absurd and false ideas  
and opinions which so generally prevails with respect to us, and that your  
sentiments are concurrent with mine, which are that an universal Father  
hath given being to us all of one flesh, but that he hath also without par-  
tiality afforded us all the same sensations and endowed us all with the  
same faculties, and that howewer variable we may be in society or religion,  
however diversified in situation or color, we are all of the same family and  
stand in the same relation to him.  
  
“Sir, if these are sentiments of which you are fully persuaded, I hope  
you cannot but acknowledge that it is the indispensable duty of those who  
maintain for themselves the rights of human nature, and who profess the  
obligations of Christianity, to extend their power and influence to the re-  
lief of every part of the human race from whatever burden or oppression  
they may unjustly labor under; and this, I apprehend, a full conviction of  
the truth and obligation of these principles should lead all to.  
  
“Sir, I have long been convinced that if your love for yourselves and  
for those inestimable laws which preserve to you the rights of human na-  
ture was founded on sincerity, you could not but be solicitous that every in-  
dividual, of whatever rank or distinction, might with you equally enjoy the  
blessings thereof; neither could you rest satisfied short of the most active  
diffusion of your exertions in order to their promotion from any state of  
degradation to which the unjustifiable cruelty and barbarism of men may  
have reduced them.  
  
“Sir, I freely and cheerfully acknowledge that I am of the African race,  
and, in that color which is natural to them, of the deepest dye, and it is  
under a sense of the most profound gratitude to the supreme Ruler of the  
universe that I now confess to you that I am not under that state of  
tyrannical thraldom and inhuman captivity to which too many of my  
brethren are doomed, but that I have abundantly tasted of the fruition of  
those blessings which proceed from that free and unequalled liberty with  
which you are favored, and which I hope you will willingly allow you have  
received from the immediate hand of that Being ‘from whom proceedeth  
every good and perfect gift.  
  
“Sir, suffer me to recall to your mind that time in which the arms and  
tyranny of the British crown were exerted with every powerful effort in  
order to reduce you to a state of servitude. Look back, I entreat you, on  
the variety of dangers to which you were exposed; reflect on that time  
in which every human aid appeared unavailable, and in which even hope  
and fortitude wore the aspect of inability to the conflict ; and you cannot

dential preservation ; you cannot but acknowledge that the present freedom  
and tranquillity which you enjoy you have mercifully received, and that it is  
the peculiar blessing of Heaven.  
  
“This, sir, was a time in which you clearly saw into the injustice of a  
state of slavery, and in which you had just apprehension of the horrors of  
its condition.  
  
“It was now, sir, that your abhorrence thereof was so excited that you  
publicly held forth this true and invaluable doctrine, which is worthy  
to be recorded and remembered in all succeeding ages: ‘We hold these  
truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal, and that they are  
endowed with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are life, liberty,  
and the pursuit of happiness.’  
  
“Here, sir, was a time in which your tender feelings for yourself had  
engaged you thus to declare you were then impressed with proper ideas of  
the great valuation of liberty and the free possession of those blessings to  
which you were entitled by nature.  
  
“ But, sir, how pitiable is it to reflect that although you were so fully  
convinced of the benevolence of the Father of mankind, and of his equal  
and impartial distribution of these rights and privileges which he had con-  
ferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract his mercies  
in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren  
under groaning captivity and cruel oppression; that you should at the  
same time be found guilty of that most criminal act which you professedly  
detested in others with respect to yourselves!  
  
“ Sir, I suppose that your knowledge of the situation of my brethren is  
too extensive to need a recital here; neither shall I presume to prescribe  
methods by which they may be relieved, otherwise than by recommending  
to you and all others to wean yourselves from those narrow prejudices  
which you have imbibed with respect to them, and, as Job proposed to his  
friends, ‘put your souls in their souls’ stead.’ Thus shall your hearts be  
enlarged with kindness and benevolence towards them, and thus shall you  
need neither the direction of myself nor others in what manner to proceed  
herein.  
  
“And now, sir, although my sympathy and affection for my brethren  
hath caused my enlargement thus far, I ardently hope that your candor  
and generosity will plead with you in my behalf when I make known to  
you that it was not originally my design, but that, having taken up my pen  
in order to direct to you as a present a copy of an almanac which I have  
calculated for the succeeding year, I was unexpectédly and unavoidably led  
thereto.  
  
“This calculation, sir, is the production of my arduous study in this my  
advanced stage of life; for, having long had unbounded desires to become  
acquainted with the secrets of nature, I have had to gratify my curiosity  
herein through my own assiduous application to astronomical study, in  
which I need not to recount to you the many difficulties and disadvantages  
which I have had to encounter. And although I had almost declined to  
make my calculation for the ensuing year, in consequence of that time  
which I had allotted therefor being taken up at the Federal Territory by  
the request of Mr. Andrew Ellicott, yet, finding myself under several en-

Sir: I am fully sensible of the greatness of  
that freedom which 1 take with you on the

me scarcely allowable when I reflected on that  
distinguished and dignified station in which  
you stand, and the almost general prejudice

suppose it is a truth too well attested to you  
to need a proof here that we are a race of

Sir, I hope I may safely admit, in conse­

that you are a man far less inflexible in.senti­

you are measurably friendly and well-dis­

willing to lend your aid and assistance to our

false ideas and opinions which so generally

that an universal Father hath given being to  
us of one flesh, but that he hath also without

Sir: I am fully sensible of the great­  
ness of that freedom which 1 take with  
you on the present occasion—a liberty  
which seemed to me scarcely allow­  
able when I reflected on that dis­  
tinguished and dignified station in  
which you stand, and the almost gen­  
eral prejudice and prepossession which  
are so prevalent in the world against  
those of my complexion. •! suppose it  
is a tmth too well attested to you to  
need a proof here that we are a race of  
beings who have long labored under  
*the •abuse and censure of the world,  
that we have long been considered  
rather as brutish than human, and  
scarcely capable of mental endowment.  
Sir, I hope I may safely admit, in  
consequence of that report which hath  
reached me, that you are a man far less  
inflexible in sentiments of this nature  
than many others, that you are measur­  
ably friendly and well-disposed toward  
us, and that you are ready and willing  
to lend your aid and assistance to our  
relief from those many distressed and  
numerous calamities to which we are  
reduced.  
Sir, I have long been convinced that  
if your love for yourselves and those  
inestimable laws which preserve to you  
the rights of human nature were  
founded on sincerity, you could not but  
be more solicitous that every individ­  
ual, of whatever rank or distinction,  
might with you equally enjoy the  
blessings thereof; neither could you  
rest satisfied of the most active diffu­  
sion of your exertions in order to their  
promotion from any state of degrada­  
tion to which the unjustifiable cruelty  
and barbarism of men may have re­  
duced them.  
Sir, I freely and cheerfully acknowl­  
edge that I am of the African race,  
and, in that color which is natural to  
them, of the deepest dye, and it is un­  
der a sense of the most profound grati­  
tude to the Supreme Ruler of the uni­  
verse that I now confess to you that I  
am not under that state of tyrannical  
thraldom and inhuman captivity to  
which too many of my brethren are  
doomed, but that I have abundantly  
tasted of the fruition of those blessings  
which proceed from that free and un­  
equaleu liberty with which you are fa­  
vored. and which I hope you will will­  
ingly allow you have received from the  
immediate hand of that Being from  
whom proccedeth every good and per­  
fect gift.  
Now, sir, if this is found in truth I  
apprehend you will readily embrace  
every opportunity to eradicate that  
train of absurd and false ideas and  
opinions which so generally prevails  
with respect to us, and that your senti­  
ments are concurrent with mine, which  
are that an universal. Fat her hath given  
being to us of one ’ flesh, but that He  
hath also without partiality afforded us  
all the same sensations ami endowed us  
all with t^e same faculties, and that  
however variable we may be in society  
or religion, however diversified in situ­  
ation or color, we are all of the same  
family and stand in the same relation  
to him.  
Sir, if these are sentiments of which  
you are fully persuaded, I hope you can­  
hot but acknowledge that it is the indis­  
pensable duty of those who maintain  
for themselves the right of human na­  
ture, and who profess the obligations  
of Christianity, to”1 extend their power  
and influence to the relief of’every part  
of the human race from whatever bur­  
den or oppression they may unjustly  
labor under; and this, I apprehend, a  
full conviction of the truth and obliga­  
tion of these principles should lead all  
to.  
Sir, sutler me to recall to your mind  
that time in which the arms and ty­  
ranny of the British crown were exerted  
with every powerful effort in order to  
reduce you to a state of servitude.  
lx&gt;ok back, I entreat you, on the va­  
riety of dangers to which you were ex­  
posed: reflect on that, time in which  
every human aid appeared unavailable,  
and in which even hope and fortitude  
wore the aspect of inability to conflict; j  
and you cannot but be led to*a serious I  
and grateful sense of your miraculous .  
and providential preservation; you i  
cannot but acknowledge that the pres- j  
ent freedom and tranquility which you i  
enjoy yon have mercifully received, 1  
and that it is the peculiar blessing of&#x27;  
heaven.  
This, Sir, was a time in which you ;  
clearly saw into the injustice of a start- •  
of slavery, and in which you had just ■  
apprehension of the horrors of its con-!  
diwon.  
It was now. Sir, that your abhor- i  
rence thereof was so excited that you ■  
publicly held forth this true and val- :  
uable doctrine. which is worthy to be |  
recorded and lemcmbered in all sue-1  
eeeding ages-. ‘We hold these truths to  
be seU-ewdent: that all men are created ,  
equal, and that they are endowed wit^ .  
certain inalienable rights: that among  
these are life, liberty and the pursuit of .  
happine A*  
Here. Sir, was a time In which your ;  
ten ’«r f-e mg* for yourself had engaged i  
vou thus to declare you were then im-1  
  
pressed with proper ideas of the great  
valuation of liberty and the free pos­  
session of those blessings to which you  
were endowed by nature.  
But, Sir, how pitiable is it to reflect  
that although you were so fully con­  
vinced of the benevolence of the Father  
of mankind, and of his equal and im­  
partial distribution of these rights and  
privileges which he had conferred upon  
them, that you should at the same time  
counteract his mercies in detaining by  
fraud and violence so numerous a part  
of my brethren under groaning captiv­  
ity and cruel oppression: that you  
should at the same lime be found guilty  
of that most criminal act which you  
professedly detested in others with re­  
spect to yourselves!  
Sir, I suppose ti*at your knowledge  
of the situation of my brethren is too  
extensive to need a recital here; neither  
shall I presume to prescribe methods  
by which they may be relieved, other­  
wise than by recommending to you and  
all others to wean yourselves from those  
narrow prejudices which you have im­  
bibed with respect to them, and, as Job  
proposed to his friends, ‘put your souls  
in your souls’ stead.’ Thus shall your  
hearts be enlarged with kindness and  
benevolence toward them, and thus  
shall you need neither the direction of  
myself nor others in what manner to  
proceed herein.  
And now, Sir, although my sympathy  
and affection for my brethren hath  
caused my enlargement thus far, 1 ar­  
dently hope that your candor and gen­  
erosity will plead with you in my behalf  
when I make known to you that it was  
not originally my design&quot;, but that, hav­  
ing taken up my pen in order to direct  
to you as a present a copy of an al­  
manac which I have calculated for the  
succeeding year, I was unexpectedly  
and unavoidably led thereto.  
This calculation, Sir. is the produc­  
tion of my arduous study in this my  
advanced stage of life; for, having long  
had unbounded desires to become ac­  
quainted with the secrets of nature, I  
have had to gratify ray curiosity herein  
through my own assiduous application  
to astronomical study, in which I need  
not recotint to you the many difficulties  
and disadvantages which I have had to  
encounter. And although I had almost  
declined to make calculation for • the  
ensuing year, in consequence of that  
time which 1 had allowed therefor being  
taken up at the Federal Territory by  
the request of Mr. Andrew Ellicott, yet,  
finding myself under several engage­  
ments to printers of this State, to whom  
I communicated my design, on my re­  
turn to my place of residence, I in­  
dustriously applied myself thereto,  
which, I hope, I have accomplished  
with correctness and accuracy. A copy  
of which I have taken the liberty to di­  
rect you, and which I humbly request  
you will favorably receive. And al­  
though you may have the opportunity  
of perusing it after its publication, yet  
I choose to send it to you in manuscript  
previous thereto, that thereby you might  
also view it in my own handwriting.

Maryland, Baltimore County, near

THOMAS JEFFERSON Secretary of State.  
Sir:—I am fully Sensible of the  
  
greatness of that freedom which I  
  
take with you on the present occa-  
  
sion; a liberty which seemed to me  
  
Scarcely allowable, when I reflected

on that distinguished and dignified  
station in which you Stand, and the  
almost general prejudice and pre-  
possession which is so prevalent in  
the world against those of my com-  
plexion.  
  
I suppose it is a truth too well at-  
tested to you, to need a proof here,  
that we are a race of Beings who  
have long laboured under the abuse  
and censure of the world, that we  
have long been considered rather as  
brutish than human, and scarcely  
capable of mental endowments.  
  
Sir I hope I may Safely admit, in  
consequence of that report which  
hath reached me, that you are a man  
far less inflexible in Sentiments of  
this nature, than many others, that  
you are measureably friendly and  
well disposed toward us, and that  
you are willing and ready to lend  
your aid and assistance to our relief  
from those many distresses and num-  
erous calamities to which we are re-  
duced.  
  
Now, Sir, if this is founded in truth,  
I apprehend you will readily embrace  
every opportunity, to eradicate that  
train of absurd and false ideas and  
opinions which so generally prevails  
with respect to us, and that your

which are that one universal Father  
hath given Being to us all, and that  
he hath not only made us all of one  
flesh, but that he hath also without  
partiallity, afforded us all the same  
sensations, and endued us all with  
the Same faculties, and that however  
variable we may be in Society or re-  
ligion, however diversified in Situa-  
tion or colour, we are all of the same  
family, and Stand in the Same rela-  
tion to him.  
  
Sir, if these are sentiments of which  
you are fully persuaded, I hope you  
cannot but acknowledge, that it is  
the indispensible duty of those who  
maintain for themselves the rights of  
human nature and who profess the  
obligations of christianity, to extend  
their power and influence to the re-  
lief of every pari of the human race,  
from whatever burthen or oppression  
they may unjustly labour under, and  
this I apprehend a full conviction of  
the truth and obligation of these  
principles should lead all to.  
  
Sir, I have long been convinced,  
that if your love for yourselves,  
and for those inesteemable laws  
which preserve to you the rights of  
human nature, was founded on Sin-  
cerity, you could not but be Solici-  
tous that every individual of whatever  
rank or distinction, might with you  
equally enjoy the blessings thereof,  
neither could you rest satisfied, short  
of the most active diffusion of your  
exertions, in order to their promo-  
tions from any State of degredation,  
to which the unjustifiable cruelty  
and barbarism of men may have re-  
duced them.  
  
Sir, I freely and cheerfully ac-  
knowledge, that I am of the African  
race, and in that colour which is nat-  
  
  
  
ural to them of the deepest dye, and  
it is under a Sense of the most pro-  
found gratitude to the Supreme  
Ruler of the universe, that I now  
confess to you, that I am not under  
that state of tyrannical thraldom,  
and inhuman captivity, to which too  
many of my brethren are doomed;  
but that I have abundantly tasted of  
the fruition of those blessings, which  
proceed from that free and unequalled  
liberty with which you are favoured,  
and which I hope you will willingly  
allow you have receiv’d from the im-  
mediate hand of that Being, from  
whom proceedeth every good and  
perfect gift.  
  
Sir, Suffer me to recall to your  
mind that time, in which the Arms  
and tyranny of the British Crown  
were exerted with every powerful ef-  
fort in order to reduce you to a State  
of Servitude, look back I entreat you  
on the variety of dangers to which  
you were exposed, reflect on that  
time in which every human aid ap-  
peared unavailable, and in which  
even hope and fortitude wore the as-  
pect of inability to the conflict, and  
you cannot but be ied to a Serious  
and grateful sense of your miracu-  
lous and providential preservation;  
you cannot but acknowledge, that  
the present freedom and tranquillity  
which you enjoy you have mercifully  
received, and that it is the peculiar  
blessing of Heaven.  
  
This Sir, was a time in which you  
clearly saw into the injustice of a  
state of Slavery, and in which you  
had Just apprehensions of the hor-  
rors of its condition, it was now Sir,  
that your abhorrence thereof was so  
excited, that you publickly held forth  
this true and invaluable doctrine,  
  
  
  
  
  
which is worthy to be recorded and  
remembered in all Succeeding ages.  
“We hold these truths to be self evi-  
dent, that all men are created equal,  
and that they are endowed by their  
creator with certain unalienable  
rights, that among these are life, lib-  
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  
  
Here Sir, was a time in which your  
tender feelings for your Selves had  
engaged you thus to declare, you  
were then impressed with proper  
ideas of the great valuation of lib-  
erty, and the free possession of those  
blessings to which you were entitled  
by nature; but Sir, how pitiable it is  
to reflect that altho you were so fully  
convinced of the benevolence of the  
Father of mankind, and of his equal  
and impartial distribution of those  
rights and privileges which he had  
conferred upon them, that you should  
at the same time counteract his mer-  
cies, in detaining by fraud and vio-  
lence so numerous a part of my  
brethren under groaning captivity  
and cruel oppression, that you should  
at the same time be found guilty of  
that most criminal act which you  
professedly detested in others, with  
respect to your Selves.  
  
Sir, I suppose that your knowledge  
of the Situation of my brethren is  
too extensive to need a recital here;  
neither shall I presume to prescribe  
methods by which they may be re-  
lieved, otherwise than by recom-  
mending to you and all others, to  
wean yourselves from those narrow  
prejudices which you have imbibed  
with respect to them, and as Job pro-  
posed to his friend “ Put your Souls  
in their Souls Stead,” thus shall yoy  
hearts be enlarged with kindness and  
benevolence toward them, and thus

shall you need neither the direction  
of my Self or others in what manner  
to proceed herein.  
  
And now, Sir, altho my Sympathy  
and affection for my brethren hath  
caused my enlargement thus far, I  
ardently hope that your candour and  
generosity will plead with you in my  
behalf, when I make known to you,  
shat it was not orriginall, my design;  
but that having taken up my pen in  
order to direct to you as a present a  
copy of an Almanac which I have  
calculated for the Succeeding year, I  
was unexpectedly and unavoidably  
led thereto.  
  
This calculation Sir, is the produc-  
tion of my arduous Study in this my  
advanced stage of life; for having  
long had unbounded desires to be-  
come acquainted with the Secrets of  
nature, I have had to gratify my  
curiosity herein thro my own assidu-  
ous application to Astronomical  
Study, in which I need not to recount  
to you the many difficulties and dis-  
advantages which I have had to en-  
counter.  
  
And altho I had almost declined  
to make my calculation for the en-  
  
suing year, in consequence of that’  
  
time which I had allotted therefore  
being taken up at the Federal Terri-  
tory, by the request of Mr. Andrew  
Ellicott, yet finding my Self underal  
several engagements to printers of  
this State to whom I had communi-  
cated my design, on my return to my  
place of residence, I industriusly ap-  
plyed my Self thereto, which I hope  
I have accomplished with correctness  
and accuracy, a copy of which I have  
taken the liberty to direct to you,  
and which I humbly request you will  
favourably receive, and altho you

to Send it to you in manuscript pre-  
vious thereto, that thereby you might  
not only have an earlier inspection,
