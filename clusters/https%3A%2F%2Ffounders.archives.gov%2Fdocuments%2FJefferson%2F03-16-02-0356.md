mediately, and before there will have been time for unfriendly combinations and maneuvres by the enemies of the institution.   I inclose you now a paper presenting some views which may be useful to you in conversations, to rebut exaggerated estimates of what our institution is to cost, and reproaches of deceptive estimates. 162.364.D. will be about the cost of the whole establishment when compleated. not an office at Washington has cost less. the single building of the Courthouse of Henrico has cost nearly that: and the massive walls of the millions of bricks of Wm &amp; Mary could not be now built for a greater sum.  
Surely Governor Clinton’s display of the gigantic efforts of N. York towards the education of their citizens will stimulate the pride, as well as the patriotism of our legislature, to look to the reputation &amp; safety of their own country, to rescue it from the degradation of becoming the Barbary of the union, and of falling into the ranks of our own negroes. to that condition it is fast  sinking. we shall be, in the hands of the other states what our indigenous predecessors were when invaded by the science &amp; arts of Europe. the mass of education in Virginia, before the revolution, placed her with the foremost of her sister colonies. what is her education now? where is it? the little we have we import, like beggars, from other states; or import their beggars to bestow on us their miserable crumbs. and what is wanting to restore us to our station among our confederates? not more mone

I think not. the truth is that the want of common education with us is not from our poverty, but from the want of an orderly system. more money is now paid for the education of a part, than would be paid for that of the whole if systematically arranged. 6000. common schools in New York, 50. pupils in each, 300,000 in all; 160.000.D. annually paid to the masters; 40. established academies, with 2218. pupils, and 5. Colleges with 718. students, to which last classes of institutions 720,000.D. have been given, and the whole appropriations for education estimated at 2½ millions of Dollars! what a pigmy to this is Virginia become! with a population all but equal to that of New York! and whence this difference? from the difference their rulers set on the value of knolege, and the prosperity it produces
