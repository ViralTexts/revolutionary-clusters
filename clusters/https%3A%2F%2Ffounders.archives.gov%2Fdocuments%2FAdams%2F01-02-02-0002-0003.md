this day. It is the last day of Arresting for July Court. What equivalent I shall meet with here is uncertain.  
It has been my Fate, to be acquainted, in the Way of my Business, with a Number of very rich Men—Gardiner, Bowdoin, Pitts, Hancock, Rowe, Lee, Sargeant, Hooper, Doane. Hooper, Gardiner, Rowe, Lee, and Doane, have all acquired their Wealth by their own Industry. Bowdoin and Hancock received theirs by Succession, Descent or Devise. Pitts by Marriage. But there is not one of all these, who derives more Pleasure from his Property than I do from mine. My little Farm, and Stock, and Cash, affords me as much Satisfaction, as all their immense Tracts, extensive Navigation, sumptuous Buildings, their vast Sums at Interest, and Stocks in Trade yield to them. The Pleasures of Property, arise from Acquisition more than Possession, from what is to come rather than from what is. These Men feel their Fortunes. They feel the Strength and Importance, which their Riches give them in the World. Their Courage and Spirits are buoyed up, their Imaginations are inflated by them. The rich are seldom remarkable for Modesty, Ingenuity, or Humanity. Their Wealth has rather a Tendency to make them penurious and selfish.

‘♦lt has been my fata to be acquainted in  
the way of business, with a number of very  
rich men, Gardiner, Bowdotti, Pitta, Han­  
cock, Howe, Senrgent, Hooper,  
Dome, Cooper. Gardiner, HoWe, Lee, and  
Donne, have afl acquired tbeir wealth by  
their own industry, Bowdoin and Hancock  
received theirs by succession, descent orde­  
vi*c. Pitts by marriage. But there 1* not  
one of all these who derives more pleasure  
from his property than I do from mine. My  
little ftrm and stuck and cash afford me as  
much satisfaction as ail their immense tracts,  
extensive navigation, sumptuous buildings,  
their vast sums ot interest and stocks in  
trade yield them. The pleasures of prop­  
erty arise from acquisition more thaa pos­  
session, from what is to comr. rather than  
what is. The r*rb are seldom remarkable  
for modesty, ingenuity or humanity. Their  
wealth ha« rnthcr h tendency to make them  
penurious aud selfish”
