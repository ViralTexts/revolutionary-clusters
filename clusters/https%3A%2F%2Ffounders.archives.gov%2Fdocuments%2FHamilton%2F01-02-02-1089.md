My Dear Sir.  
Head Quarters NewWindsor [New York] Feby 18, 81  
  
Since I had the pleasure of writing you last an unexpected change has taken place in my situation. I am no longer a member of the General’s family. This information will surprise you and you will be more surprised at the manner of my ceasing to be soand the manner of the change will surprise you more.—Two day ago The General was coming up stairs and I was going downand I passed each other on the stairs. He told me he wanted to speak to me on some business. I answered that I shouldwould wait upon him immediately. I went below and delivered Mr. Tilghman a letter for Mr. Blaine to be sent to Mr. Blaine conveyingThe Commissary containing an order of a pressing and interesting nature. Without delaying a moment I was Returning to The General I was stopped the in the way by the the Marquis De la Fayette stopped me, and we conversed together about half a minute on a matter of business. He can testify how impatient I was to get awayback, and that I left him in a manner which but for our intimacy  would have been more than abrupt. if not rude Instead of finding the General as usual in his room, I met him at the head of the stairs, where accosting me in a very angry tone, “Col Hamilton (said he), you have kept me waiting at the head of the stairs these ten minutes. I must tell you Sir you treat me with disrespect.” I replied without petulancy, but with decision “I am not conscious of it Sir, but since you have thought it necessary to tell me so we must part” “Very well Sir (answered said he) if it be your choice” or something to this effect and we separated.  
I sincerely believe my absence which gave so much umbrage did not last two minutes.  
In less than an hour after, Tilghman came to me in the Generals name assuring me of his great confidence in my abilities, integrity usefulness and the like &amp;c and of his desire in a candid conversation to reconeileheal a difference which could not have happened but in a moment of passion.

me he wanted to speak to me. Ianswered that  
Twould wait upon him immediately. I went  
below and delivered Mr. Tilghman a letter to be  
sent to the Commissary, containing an order of a  
pressing and interesting nature. Returning to  
the General I was stopped on the way by the  
Marquis de Lafayette, and we conversed together  
about a minute on a matter of business. Me can  
testify how impatient I was to get back, and  
that IT left himin amanner which, but for our  
intimacy, would have been more than abrupt.  
Instead of finding the General, as is usual, in  
his room, I met him atthe head of the stairs,  
where, accosting me in anangry tone, ‘Col.  
Hamilton,’ said ke, ‘ you have kept me waiting  
at the head of the stairs these ten minutes. I  
must. tell you, Sir, you treat me with  
disrespect.’ I replied without petulancy,  
but with decision: ‘I am not conscious  
of it, Sir; but since vou have thought it  
necessary to tell me so, we part.’ ‘Very well, Sir,’  
said he, ‘if it be your choice,’ or something to  
this effect, and we separated. L sincerely believe  
my absence, which gave se much umbrage, did  
not last two minutes. In less than an hour  
after ‘Rilghman came to me in the General&#x27;s  
name, assuring me of his great contidence in my  
abilities, integrity, usefulness, &amp;¢., aud of his
