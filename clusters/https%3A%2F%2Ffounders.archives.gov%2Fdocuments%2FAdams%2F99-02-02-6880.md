In Mr Wirts elegant and eloquent Panegyrick on Mr Henry.—I beg your attention to page 56 to page 67. the end of the second section. Where you will read a curious specimen of the agonies of Patriotism in the early Stages of the Revolution—“When Mr Henry could carry his Resolutions but by one Vote, and that against the influence of Randolph, Bland, Pendelton Wythe and all the Old members whose influence in the House had till then been unbroken; and when Peyton Randolph afterwards President of Congress swore a round Oath, he would have given 500 Guineas for a Single Vote; for one Vote would have divided the House and Robinson was in the Chair, who he knew would have negatived the Resolution.”—  
And you will also see the confused manner in which they were first recorded, and how they have since been garbled in History.—My remarks at present will be confined to the anecdote in page 65.—  
Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the first his Cromwell—and George the third.—Treason cried the Speaker—Treason—Treason—echoed from every part of the House.—Henry finished his sentence, by the words—“May profit by their example”—If this be Treason make the most of it.—!  
In Judge Minots History of Massachusetts Bay, Volume second, in Page 102 and 103, You will find another Agony of Patriotism in 1762, three years before Mr Henry’s. Mr Otis suffered one of equal severity in the House of Representatives of Massachusetts.—Judge Minots account of it, is this.—  
It was passed  
The remonstrance offered to the Governor was attended with agravating circumstances. It was passed; after a very warm Speech, by a Member in the House—and at first contained the following offensive Observation—  
“For it will be of little consequence to the People whether they were subject to George or Louis—the King of Great Britain, or the French King—if both were Arbitary, as both would be, if both could Levy Taxes without Parliament.” Though Judge Minot does not say it—the warm Speech was from the Tongue, and the Offensive Observation, from the pen, of James Otis—When these words of the Remonstrance were first read in the House, Timothy Paine Esqr a Member from Worcester,—in his Zeal for Royalty though a very worthy and a very Amiable Man cryed out, Treason! Treason! The House were not however intimidated, but Voted the remonstrance with all the Treason contained in it—by a large Majority, and it was presented to the Governor by a committe of which Mr Otis was a Member.—  
Judge Minot proceeds—“The Governor was so displeased with the passage that he sent a Letter to the Speaker returning the Message of House;—in which he said,—that the Kings Name,—dignity, and Cause, were so improperly treated that he was obliged to desire the Speaker to recommend earnestly to the House,—that it might not be entered upon the minutes in the terms in which it then Stood.—For if it should, he was then Satisfied they would again, and again, wish that some part of it were expunged—especially if it should appear, as he doubted not it would when he entered upon his Vindication,that there was not the least ground for the insinuation, under Colour of which, that Sacred and well-beloved name was so disrespectfully brought into question.—Upon the reading of this Letter, the exceptionable Clause was struck out of the Message.—  
I have now before me a Pamphlet printed in 1763 by Edes and Gill in Queen Street Boston—Entitled a Vindication of the Conduct of the House of Representatives of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay—More particularly in the last Session of the General Assembly, by James Otis Esqr. a member of said House, with this Motto:Let such, such, only tread this Sacred floor,Who dare to love their Country, and be poor;Or good, tho’ rich, humane and wise, tho’ great,Jove give but these, tho’ we’ve nought to fear from fate.  
I wish I could transcribe the whole of this Pamphlet, because it is a document of importance in the early History of Revolution, which ought never to be forgotten.—It shows in a Strong light the Heaves and throes of the burning Mountain, three years at least, before the Explosion of the Volcano in Massachusetts, or Virginia.—  
Had Judge Minot ever seen this Pamphlet, could he have given so superficial an Account of this year 1762.?—There was more than one “warm Speech” made in that Session of the Legislature—Mr Otis himself made many.—A dark Cloud hung over the whole Continent;—but it was peculiarly black and threatening over Massachusetts and the Town of Boston, against which devoted City the first Thunderbolts of Parliamentary Omnipotence were intended and expected to be darted.—Mr Otis from his first appearance in the House in 1761. had shewn such a vast Superiority of Talents, Information, and Energy to every other Member of the House,—that in 1762, he took the lead as it were of Course.—He opened the Session with a Speech,—a Sketch of which he has given Us himself. It depends upon no man’s Memory. It is warm; it is true. But it is warm only with Loyalty to his King, Love to his Country, and Exultations in her Exertions in the national Cause

—  
This Pamphlet ought to be reprinted and deposited in the Cabinet of the Curious. The Preface is a frank candid and manly Page, explaining the Motive of the Publication, viz, the Clamours against the House for their Proceedings, in which he truly says.—“The World ever has been, and ever will be pritty equally divided, between those two great Parties, vulgarly called the Winners and the Loosers; or to speak more precisely, between those who are discontented that they have no Power, and those who think they never can have enough.”—now it is absolutely impossible to please both sides, either by temporizing, trimming, or retreating; the two former, justly incur the Censure of a wicked heart, the latter that of Cowardice, and fairly and manfully fighting the Battle, and is in the opinion of many worse than either.—On the 8th of September A. D. 1762. the War still continuening in North America and the West Indies Governor Bernard made his Speech to both Houses, and presented a Requisition of Sir Jeffrey Amherst, that the Massachusetts Troops should be continued in Pay during the Winter—  
Mr Otis made a Speech, the outlines of which he has recorded in the Pamphlet, urging a Complyance with the Governor’s recommendation and general Amherst’s Requisition; and concluding with a Motion for a Committee to Consider of both.  
5 April Continued  
A Committee was appointed of whom Mr Otis was one and reported not only a Continuence of the Troops already in Service, but an addition of Nine hundred Men with an augmented Bounty to encourage their Inlistment.—  
If the Orators on the 4th. of July, really wish to investigate the principles and Feelings which produced the Revolution, they ought to Study this Pamphlet and Dr Mayhew’s Sermon on Passive Obedience and Non Risistance, and all the documents of those 9 hr days.*—have departed from the Object of their Institution as much as the Society for propagation of the Gospel in forign Parts, have from their Charter.— The Institution had better be wholly abolished, than continued an Engine of the Politicks and Feelings of the day instead of a Memorial of the Principles and Feelings of the Revolution half a Century ago. I might have said for two Centuries before.—  
This Pamphlet of Mr Otis exhibits the interesting Spectacle of a great Man, glowing with Loyalty to his Sovereign, proud of his Connection, with the British Empire, rejoicing in its Prosperity, its Tryumphs, and its Glory, exulting in the unexampled Efforts of his own native Province to promote them all: But at the Same time grieving and complaining at the Ungenerous Treatment that Province had received from its Begining from the Mother Country and Shuddering under the Prospect of Still greater Ingratitude and Cruelty from the Same Source. Hear a few of his Words and read all the rest.—  
Mr Speaker  
“This Province has upon all Occations been distinguished by its Loyalty and readiness to contribute its most Strenuous Efforts for his Majesty’s Service, I hope this Spirit will ever remain as an indelible Characteristic of this People” &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c. “Our own immediate Interest, therefore, as well as the general Cause of our King and Country requires, that we should contribute the last Penny and the last drop of blood, rather than by any backwardness of ours, His Majesty’s Measures should be embarrassed; and thereby any of the Enterprises that may be planned for the Regular Troops, miscarry. some of these Considerations, I presume, induced the Assembly, upon his Majesty’s Requisition, Signified last Spring by Lord Egrement so cheerfully and Unanimously to raise Thirty three hundred Men for the present Campaign; and upon another Requisition, Signified by Sir Jeffery Amherst to give a handsome bounty for enlisting about nine hundred more, into the Regular Service.—The Colonies, we know have often been blamed, without Cause; and we have had Some Share of it. Witness the miscarriage of the pretended Expedition against Canada, in Queen Anne’s time, just before the infamous Treaty of Utrecht. It is well known by some now living in this Metropolis; that theoffice Officers both of the Army, and Navy, expressed their Utmost Surprize, at it, upon their arrival.—To some of them no doubt, it was a disappointment; for in order to shift the blame of this Shamefull Affair from themselves, they endeavoured to lay it, upon the New England Colonies. &amp;c   
I am therefore clearly for raising the Men. &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. This Province, has, since the Year 1754, levied for his Majesty’s Service as Soldiers and Seamen, near thirty thousand Men, besides what have been otherwise employed. One year in particular it was said that every fifth Man was engaged in one shape or another. We have raised sums for the support of this War, that the last Generation could hardly have formed any Idea of. We are now deeply in debt.” &amp; &amp;—  
On the 14th. of September the House received a Message from the Governor. Containing, a somewhat awkward Confession of Certain Expenditures of Public Money with Advice of Counsell, which had not been appropriated by the House.—He had fitted out the Massachusetts Sloop of War, encreased her Establishment of Men. &amp;c—Five years before, perhaps this Irregularity might have been connived at or pardoned. But, since the Debate concerning Writts of Assistants, and since it was known that the Acts of Trade were to be enforced and a Revenue Collected by Authority of Parliament, Mr Otis’s; Maxim, that “Taxation without Representations was Tyranny”—“and that Expenditures of publick Money, without Appropriations by the Representatives of the People, were unconstitutional, arbitrary and therefore tyrannical,” had become popular Proverbs.—They were become, common Place Observations in the Streets. It was impossible that Otis should not take fire, upon this Message of the Governor, he accordingly did take fire, upon this message of the and made that flaming Speech which Judge Minot calls “a warm Speech” without informing Us, who made it, or what it contained. I wish Mr Otis had given us this warm Speech as he has the comparatively cool one, at the Opening of the Session. But this is lost forever. It concluded however, with a Motion for a Committee to consider the Governor’s Message and report—The Committe was appointed and Otis was the first after the Speaker.—  
The Committe, reported the following Answer and Remonstrance every syllable of which, is Otis.—  
“May it please your Excellency.”  
“The House have duely attended to your Excellency’s Message of the Eleventh instant, relating to the Massachusetts Sloop, and are humble of Opinion that there is not the least necessity for keeping Up, her present Complement of Men, and therefore desire that your Excellency would be pleased to reduce them to Six, the Old Establishment made for Said Sloop by the General Court. Justice to ourselves, and to our Constituents obliges Us, to remonstrate against the method of making or increasing Establishments by the Governor and Councill.—  
“It is, in effect, taking or increasing from the House, their most darling Privelege, The Right of Originating all Taxes.—  
“It is in short annihilating one Branch of the Legislature, And when once, the Representativs of the People give up this Privilege the Government will very soon become arbitrary.—  
“No. Necessity, therefore, can be sufficient to justify, a House of Representatives in giving Up, such a Priveledge; for it would be of little Consequence to the People, whether they were Subject to George or Louis the King of Great Britain or the French King, if both were arbitrary, as both would be, if both could levy Taxes without Parliament.—  
“Had this been the first Instance of the kind, we might not have troubled your Excellency about it; but lest the matter should grow into Precedent; we earnestly beseech your Excellency, as you regard the Peace and Welfare of the Province, that no measures of this nature be taken for the future, let the advice of Council be what it may”—  
“This Remonstrance, being read was accepted by a large Majority and sent up and presented to his Excellency by a Committe of whom Mr Otis was one

eet  
The same day the above Remonstrance was delivered, the Town was allarmed with a report, that the House had Sent a Message to his Excellency reflecting on his Majisty’s Person and Government, and highly derogatory to his Crown and Dignity, and therein desired that his Excellency would in no case, take the Advice of his Majesty’s Council.  
The Governors Letter to the Speaker, is as Judge Minot represents it. Upon reading it, the Same Person who had before cried out “Treason! Treason” when he first heard the Offensive Words, now cried out “Rase them! Rase them!” They were, accordingly expunged.  
In the course of the debate, a new and Surprising doctrine was advanced. We have Seen the times, when the Majority of a Council by their Words and Actions have Seemed to think themselves obliged to comply with every thing proposed by the Chair, and to have no Rule of conduct but a Governors will and Pleasure. But now for the first Time, it was asserted, that the Governor, in all cases, was obliged to Act according to the Advice of Council, and consequently would be deemed to have no Judgment of his own.  
In page 17, Mr Otis enter on his Apology, Excuse or Justification of the offensive Words; which as it is as facetius as it is edifying, I will transcribe at length in his own Words. viz.  
“In Order to excuse, if not altogether justify, the Offensive passage and clear it from ambiguity, I beg leave to premise, two or three Data. 1. God made all Men naturally equal. 2. The Ideas of earthly Superiority Preheminence and Grandeur are educational, at least acquired, not innate. 3. Kings were, and Plantation Governors Should be made for the good of the People, and not the People for them. 4. No Government has a Right to make Hobby Horses, Asses and Slaves of the Subject; nature having made Sufficient of the former, for all the lawful purposes of man, from the harmless peasant in the field, to the most refined Politician in the Cabinet; but none of the last, which infallibly proves they are unnecessary. 5. Tho’ most Governments are de facto arbitrary and consequently, the curse and Scandal of Human Nature, Yet none are de Jure, arbitrary. 6. The British Constitution of Government as now established in his Majesty’s Person and Family, is the wisest and best in the World. 7. The King of Great Britain is the best, as well as the most glorious Monarch upon the Globe and his Subjects the happiest in the Universe. 8. It is most humbly presumed, the King would have all his Plantation Governors follow his Royal Example, in a wise and Strict Adherence to the Principles of the British Constitution, by which in conjunction with his other Royal Virtues, he is enabled to reign in the hearts of a brave and generous a free and loyal People. 9. This is the Summit, the Ne plus Ultra of human Glory and Felicity. 10. The French King is a despotick arbitrary Prince, and consequently, his Subjects are very miserable.”  
“Let Us now take a more careful review of this passage, which by Some out of doors has been represented as Seditious, rebellious and traiterous. I hope none, however, will be So wanting to the Interest of their Country as to represent the matter in this light on the East Side of the Atlantick, tho’ recent instances of Such a Conduct might be quoted, wherein the Province has, after its most Strenuous Efforts, during this and other Wars been painted in all the Odious Colours that Avarice Malice and the worst Passions could Suggest.”  
“The House assert, that it would be of little importanc Consequence to the People, whether they were Subject to George or Louis, The King of Great Britain or the French King, if both were arbitrary as both would be, if both could levy Taxes without Parliament.” Or in the Same Words transposed without, without the least Alteration of the Sense. It would be of little consequence to the People, whether they were Subject to George the King of Great Britain, or Lewis the French King, if both were arbitrary as both would be, if both could levy Taxes without Parliament.”  
“The first question that would occur to a Philosopher, if any question could be made about it, would be, whether it were true. But Truth being of little importance, with most modern Politicians, We Shall touch lightly on that Topick, and proceed to Enquiries of a more interesting nature.”  
“That arbitrary Government implies the worst of Temporary Evils, or at least the continual danger of them, is certain. That a Man would be pretty equally Subject to these Evils, under every arbitrary Government is clear. That I should die very Soon after my head Should be cutt off, whether by a Sabre or a broad Sword, whether chopped off to gratify a Tyrant, by the Christian name of Tom, Dick or Harry, is evident. That the Name of the Tyrant would be of no more avail to Save my Life, than the Name of the Executioner needs no proof. It is therefore manifestly of no importance what a Princes Christian name is, if he be arbitrary, any more indeed if he were not arbitrary. So the whole amount of this dangerous Proposition may at least in one View be reduced to this, viz. It is of little importance what a Kings Christian name is. It is, indeed of Importance that a King, a Governor, and all other good Christians, Should have a Christian Name, but whether Edward Francis or William, is of none, that I can discern. It being a Rule to put the most mild and favourable construction upon Words that they can possibly bear, it will follow that this Proposition is a very harmless one, that cannot by any means tend to prejudice his Majesty’s Person, Crown, Dignity, or Cause, all which I deem equally Sacred, with his Excellency.”  
“If this Proposition will bear an hudred different Constructions they must all be admitted before any that imports any bad Meaning, much more a treasonable one.”  
“It is conceived the House intended nothing disrespectful of His Majesty, his Government, or Governor, in those Words. It would be very injurious to insinuate this of a House that upon all Occasions has distinguished itself by a truly loyal Spirit and which Spirit possesses at least nine hundred and ninety nine in a thousand, of their Constituents throughout the Province. One good natured Construction at least Seems to be implied in the Assertion and that pretty Stronly, viz. that in the present Situation of Great Britain and France, it is of vast importance to be a Briton rather than a Frenchman, as the French King is an arbitrary despotic Prince but the King of Great Britain is not So de Jure, de Facto, nor by Inclination; a greater difference on this Side of the Grave cannot be found, than that which Subsists between British Subjects and the Slaves of Tyranny.”  
“Perhaps it may be objected, that there is Some difference ever between arbitrary Princes, in this respect at least, that Some are more rigorous than others. It is granted; but then, let it be remembered that the Life of Man is as a vapour that Soon vanisheth away, and We know not who may come after him a wise Man or a Fool; though the Chances before and Since Solomon have ever been in favour of the latter. Therefore it is Said of little Consequence. Had it been, No instead of Little, the Clause upon the most rigid Stricture might have been found barely exceptionable.”  
“Some fine Gentlemen have charged the Expression as indelicate. This is a Capital Impeachment in Politicks, and therefore demands our most Serious Attention. The Idea of delicacy, in the Creed of Some Politicians implies, that an Inferior Should at the Peril of all that is near and dear to him, i.e. his Interest, avoid every the least trifle that can offend his Superior. Does my Superior want my Estate? I must give it him, and that with a good Grace; which is appearing, and if possible, being really obliged to him, that he will condescend to take it. The Reason in evident; it might give him Some little pain or Uneasiness to See me whimpering, much more openly complaining, at the loss of a little glittering dirt. I must according to the System, not only endeavour to acquire myself, but impress upon all around me, a reverence and passive Obedience to the Sentiments of my Superior, little Short of Adoration. Is the Superior in contemplation, a King, I must consider him as Gods Vicegerent, cloathed with unlimited Power, his Will the Supream Law, and not accountable for his Actions, let them be what they may to any Tribunal upon Earth. Is the Superior, a Plantation Governor? He must be viewed, not only as the most excellent Representation of Majesty, but as a Vice Roy in his department, and quoad Provincial Administration, to all intents and purpose vested with all the Prerogatives that were ever exercised by the most absolute Prince in Great Britain.”  
“The Votaries of this Sect, are all Monopotizers of Offices, Peculators, Informers, and generally the Seekers of all Kinds. It is better Say they, to “give up any thing and every thing quietly, than contend with a Superior, who, by his Prerogative can do, and as the Vulgar express it, right or wrong, will have whatever he pleases. For you must know, that according to Some of the most refined and fashionable Systems of modern Politicks, the Ideas of Right and Wrong, and all the moral Virtues, are to be considered only as the Vagaries of a weak or distempered Imagination in the Possessor, and of no Use in the World but for the Skilful Politician to employ convert to his own Purposes of Power And Profit.” “With these”  
“The Love of Country is an emptly name  
For Gold they hunger; but ne’er thirst for fame.”  
“It is well known that the least “patriotic Spark” unawares “catche”’ and discovered, disqualifies a Candidate from all further preforment in this famous and flourishing order of Knights errant. It must however be confessed they are So catholic as to admit all Sorts, from the Knights of the Post to a Garter and Star; provided they are thoroughly divested of the fear of God and the Love of Mankind; and have concentrated all their Views in dear Self, with them the only “Sacred and Well beloved name” or thing in the Universe. See Cardinal Richlieus Political Testament, and the greater Bible of the Sect, Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees. Richlieu expressly, in Solemn earnest, without any Sarcasm or Irony, advises the discarding all honest Men from the presence of a Prince, and from even the Purlieus of a Court. According to Mandeville, “The moral Virtues are the political Offspring, which Flattery begot upon Pride.” The most darling Principle of the great Apostle of the Order who has done more than any Mortal, towards diffusing Corruption not only through the three Kingdoms, but through the remotest dominions is, that “Every Man has his Price, and that if you bid high enough You are Sure of him.”  
“To those who have been taught to bow, at the Name of a King with as much Ardor and devotion, as a Papist at the Sight of a Crucifix, the Assertion under Examination may appear harsh; but there is an immense difference between the Sentiments of a British House of commons remonstrating, And those of a Courtier cringing for a favour. A House of Representatives here at least bears an equal proportion to a Governor, with that of a House of Commons to the King. There is indeed one difference in favour of a House of Representatives; when a House of Repres Commons address the King, they Speak to their Sovereign, who is truely the most august Personae, upon Earth: When a House of Representatives remonstrate to a Governor, they Speak to a Fellow Subject; though a Superior, who is undoubtedly intitled to decency and respect; but I hardly think, to quite So much reverence as his Master.  
“I may not be amiss to observe, that a form of Speech, may be in no Sort improper, when Used Arguendo, or for illustration, Speaking of the King, which Same form may be very harsh, indecent and ridiculous, if Spoken to the King.”  
“The Expression under Censure, has had the Approbation of diverse Gentlemen of Sense, who are quite unprejudiced to any Party. They have taken it to imply a Compliment, rather than any indecent reflection, upon his Majesty’s wise and gracious Administration. It Seems Strange therefore, that the House Should be So Suddenly charged by his Excellency, with “Impropriety, groundless Insinuation” Etc.  
“What cause of So bitter repentance, “again and again,” could possibly have taken place, if this Clause had been printed in the Journal, I cannot imagine. If the case be fairly represented, I guess the Province can be in no danger from a House of Representatives daring to Speak plain English when they are complaing of a Grivance. I Sincerely believe the House had no disposition to enter into any Contest with the Governor or Council. Sure I am that the promoters of this Address had no Such View. On the contrary, there is the highest reason to presume that the House of Representatives will at all times rejoice in the Prosperity of the Governor and Council, and contribute their Utmost Assistance, in Supporting those two Branches of the Legislature in all their just Rights and Preheminance. But the House is, and ought to be jealous and tenacious of its own Priviledges; these are a Sacred Deposit intrusted by the People, and the Jealousy of them is a Godly Jealousy.”  
Allow me now, Mr Tudor a few Remarks.  
1. Why has the Sublime Compliment of “Treason”! “Treason”! made to Mr Henry in 1765 been So celebrated when that to Mr Otis in 1762, three years before, has been totally forgotten?—Because the Virginia Patriot has had many Trumpitters and very loud ones; but the Massachusets Patriot; none, though false Accusers and vile Calumniators in Abundance.  
2. I know not whether Judge Minot was born in 1762. He certainly never Saw, heard, felt or understood any Thing of the Principles or Feelings of that Year. If he had, he could not have given So frosty an Account of it. The “Warm Speech” he mentions, was an Abridgment or Second Edition of Otis’s Argument in 1761 against the Execution of the Acts of Trade. It was a flaming Declamation against Taxation without Representation. It was a warning Voice against the Calamities that were coming Upon his Country. It was an ardent Effort to alarm and arrouse his Countrymen against the menacing System of Parliamentary Taxation.  
3. Bernard was no great Thing, but he was not a Fool. It is impossible to believe that he thought the Offensive Passage, Treason, Sedition, or of Such danger and importance as he represented it. But his design was to destroy Otis. “There is your Enemy,” Said Bernard, (after a Scottish General) “If Ye do not kill him, he will kill You.”  
4. How many Volumes are concentrated in this little fugitive Pamplet, the Production of a few hurried hours, amidst the Continual Solicitations of a Croud of Clients, for his Business at the Bar, at that time was very extensive and of the first importance; and amidst the Host of Politicians, Suggesting their Plans and Schemes claiming his Advice and directions!  
5. Look over the Declarations of Rights and Wrongs issued by Congress in 1774. Look into the Declaration of the Independence in 1776. Look into the Writings of Dr Price and Dr Priestly, look into all the French Constitutions of Government, and to cap the Climax, look into Mr Thomas Pains Common Sense, Crisis and Rights of Man; what can you find that is not to be found in Solid Substance in this “Vindication of the House of Representatives.”?  
6. Is it not an Affront to common Sense? an Insult to Truth Virtue and Patriotism to represent Patrick Henry, though he was my Friend as much as Otis, as the Father of the American Revolution and the Founder of American Independence? The Gentleman who has done this Sincerely believed what he wrote I doubt not; but he ought to be made Sensible that he is of Yesterday and knows nothing of the real Origin of the American Revolution.  
7. If there is any bitterness of Spirit discernible in Mr Otis’s Vindication this was not natural to him. He was generous, candid, manly, Social, friendly, agreable, Amiable, witty, and gay, by Nature, and by habit. Honest almost to a Proverb, though quick and passionate against meanness and deceit. But at this time he was agitated by Anxiety for his Country and irritated by a torrent of Slander and Scurrility constantly pouring upon him from all quarters.  
Mr Otis has fortified his Vindication, in a long and learned Note, which, in mercy to my Eyes and Fingers, I must borrow another hand to transcribe, in another Sheet.  
*The natural liberty of Man is to be free from any Superior power on earth, and not to be under the Will or legislative authority of Man; but to have only the law of Nature for his rule.—The liberty of Man in Society, it to be under no other legislative power, but that established by consent in the common wealth; not under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislature shall enact according to the trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells Us, O. A. 55. A liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws. But freedom of Men under government, is to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not, and not to be Subject to the unknown, unconstant, uncertain, arbitrary will of another Man; a freedom of Nature is to be under no restraint but the law of Nature—This freedom from absolute arbitrary power, is so necessary to, and closely joined with a Man’s preservation, that he cannot part with it but by what forfeits his preservation &amp; life together. For a Man not having power over his own life, cannot by compact or his own cons consent enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the absolute, arbitrary power of another, to take a-way his life when he pleases: nobody can give more power than he has himself. He that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it.  
Locke’s Discourse on Govern’t. Part II. CH. IV. The legislative, whether placed in one or more, whether it be always in being, or only by intervals, though it be the Supreme power in every common-wealth, yet in the Utmost bounds of it, it is limited to the public good of the Society, it is a power that hath no end but preservation; and those can never have a right to destroy, enslave or designedly to impoverish the Subjects.—  
These are the bounds to which the trust that is put in them, by the society, and the laws of God and nature, have set to the legislative power of every common wealth, in all forms of government.  
First, They are to govern by established promulgated laws, not to be varied in particular cases; but to have one rule for rich and poor, for the favourite at court, and the countryman at plough.—  
Secondly, These laws ought to be designed for no other and ultimately, but the good of the people.—  
Thirdly, They must not raise taxes on the property of the people, without the consent of the people, given by themselves or deputies.  
Fourthly, The legislature neither must nor can transfer the power of making laws to any body else, nor place it anywhere but where the people have.Id. Ch. XI.  
Where the legislative and executive power are in distinct hands, as they are in all moderated monarchies and well formed governments, there the good of the Society requires that several things should be left to the discretion of him that has the supreme executive power. This power to act according to discretion for the public good, without the prescription of Law, and sometimes even against it, is that which is called PREROGATIVE.  
This power, while employed for the benefit of the community, and suitable to the trust and ends of Government, is undoubted Prerogative, and is never questioned. For the people are very seldom or never scrupulous or nice in the point, they are far from examining Prerogative whilest it is in any tolerable degree employed for the use it was meant, that is, for the good of the people, and not manifestly against it. But if there comes to be a question between the executive power and the people about a thing claimed as a prerogative, the tendency of the exercise of such prerogative to the good or hurt of the people will easily decide the question.—  
Prerogative is nothing but the power of doing public good without a rule. The old question will be asked in this matterer of Prerogative, But who shall be judge when this power is made a right use of.? I answer, between an executive power in being with such prerogative, and a legislative, that depends upon his will, for their convening—There can be no judge on earth, as there can be none between the legislative and the people. Should either the executive or legislative, when they have got this power in their hands, design or go about to destroy them, the people: have no other remedy in this, as in other cases, when they have no judge upon earth, but to appeal to Heaven. Nor let any one think that this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder, for this operates not till the inconveniency is so great that the majority feel it, and are wary weary of it, and find a necessity to have it amended. But this the executive power or wise Princes never need come in the danger of; and it is the thing of all others, they have most need to avoid; as of all others the most perilous.Id. Ch. XIV.  
“Fatherly Authority, or a right of Fatherhood in our Author’s Sense (i.e. Sir Robert Filmer) is a divine unalterable right of Sovereignty, whereby a Father, or a Prince, (and a Governor might have been added) hath an absolute, arbitrary, unlimitted, and unlimitable power over the lives, liberties and estates of his Children and Subjects; so that he may take or alienate their estates, sell, castrate or use their persons as he pleases, they being all his Slaves, and he Lord proprietor of everything, and his unbounded will their law.”Locke on Govt. B. I. Ch II.  
He that will not give just occasion to think that all Government in the World is the product only of force and violence, and that men live altogether by no other rules but that of beasts, where the strongest carries it, and so lay a foundation for perpetual disorder, mischief, tumult, sedition and rebellion. (Things that the followers of that hypothesis, i.e. Filmer, and the advocates for passive Obedience, so loudly cry out against) must of necessity find out another rise of Government, another original of political power, and another way of designing and knowing the persons that have it, than what Sir R. Filmer hath taught us.”Locke on Govt. B. II. Ch. II.  
This other original Mr Locke has demonstrated to be the consent of a free people. It is possible there are a few, and I desire to thank God there is no reason to think there are many among us, that can’t bear the names of Liberty and PROPERTY, much less that the things signified by those terms, should be enjoyed by the vulgar. These may be inclined to brand some of the principles advanced in the vindication of the house.—with the odious epithets Seditious and levelling. Had any thing to justify them been quoted from Col. Algernon, Sidney, or other British Martyrs, to the liberty of their country, and outcry of Rebellion would not be surprizing. The Authority of Mr Locke has therefore been preferred to all others, for these further reasons, 1st. He was not only  One of the most wise as well as most honest. but the most impartial Man that ever lived, 2. He professedly wrote his discourses on Government, as he himself expresses it, “To establish the throne of the great restorer King William, to make good his title in the consent of the people, which being the only one of all lawful Governments, he had more fully and clearly, than any Prince in christendom, and to justify to the World, the People of England whose love of Liberty, their just and natural rights, with their resolution to preserve them, saved the Nation when it was on the brink of slavery and ruin.” By this title our Illustrious Sovereign George the Third (whom God long preserve) now holds. 3. Mr Locke was as great an ornament, under a Crown’d head, as the church of England ever had to boast off. Had all her Sons been of his wise, moderate, tolerant principles, we should probably never have heard of those civil dissentions that have so often brought the Nation to the borders of perdition. Upon the score of his being a Churchman however, his Sentiments are less liable to those inviduous reflections and insinuations that High-flyers, Jacobites, and other stupid Bigots, are apt too liberally to bestow, not only upon Dissenters of all denominations, but upon the moderate; and therefore infinitely the most valuable part of the Church of England itself.—

In the courſe of the debate a new and ſurprizing  
doctrine was advanced. We have ſeen the times when  
the majority of a council by their words and actions  
have ſeemed to think themſelves obliged to comply  
with every Thing propoſed by the Chair, and to have  
no rule of conduct but a Governor&#x27;s will and pleaſure.  
But now for the firſt time, it was aſſerted that the Go-

deemed to have no Judgment of his own. 2

* The natural liberty of man is to be free from any ſuperior  
power on earth, and not to be under the will or legiſlative authority  
of man; but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The li-  
berty of man in ſociety, is to be under no other legiſlative power,  
but that eſtabliſhed by conſent in the common wealth; nor under  
the dominion of any will, or reſtraint of any law, but what that le-  
giſlature ſhall enact according to the truſt put in it. Freedom then  
is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, O. A. 55. A liberty for every  
one to do what he liſts, to live as he pleaſes, and not to be tied  
by any laws. But freedom of men under government, is to have  
a ſtanding rule to live by, common to every one of that ſociety, and  
made by the legiſlative power erected in it ; a liberty to follow my  
own will in all things where that rule preſcribes nor, and not to&#x27;be  
ſubject to the unknown, unconſtant, uncertain, arbitrary will of ano-  
ther man; a freedom of nature is to be under no reſtraint but the  
law of nature. This freedom from abſolute arbitrary power, is ſo  
neceſſary to, and cloſely joined with a man&#x27;s preſervation, that he  
cannot part with it but by what ſorfeits his preſervation. &amp; lite toge-  
ther. For a man not having power over his own life, cannot by com-  
pac or his own conſent enſſive himſelf to any one, nor put himſelf un-  
der the abſolute, arbitrary power of another, to take away his life u hen  
he plcaſes: no body can give more power than be has himſelf.  
He that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power  
orer it. Locke&#x27;s DISCOURSE on GOVERN&#x27; r. Part II.

The legiſlative, whether placed in one or more, whether it  
  
be always in being, or only by-mtervals, though it be the ſupreme  
power in every common-wealth, yet in the utmoſt bounds of it, it is  
  
  
end but preſervation ; and thoſe can never have a right to deſtroy,  
enſlave or deſignedly to imporeriſh the ſubjects.  
  
Theſe are the bounds to which the truſt that is 2 in them, by  
the Society, and the laws of God and nature, have ſet to the Icgiſla-  
tive power of every common wealth, in all forms of government.  
  
Fir, They are to govera by eſtabliſhed promulgated laws, pot  
to be varied in particulat caſes; but to have one rule for rich and  
poor, for the favourite at court, and the countryman at plough.  
  
\ Secondly, Theſe laws ought to be deſigned for no other end ulti-  
mately, but the good. of the people.  
  
Thirdly, They muſt not raiſe taxes on the property of the people,  
without the conſent of the people, given by themſelves or deputies.  
  
Fourthly, The legiſlature neither muſt nor can transfer the power  
of making laws to any body elſe, nor place it any where but where  
the people have. I. Ch. M.  
Where the legiſlative and executive power are in diſtio&amp; hands,  
as they are in all moderated monarchies and well formed govern-  
ments, there the good of the ſociety requires that ſeveral things  
ſhould be left to the diſcretion of him that has the ſupreme executive  
power. This power to act according to diſcretion for the public  
good, without the preſcription of Law, and ſometimes even againſt  
it, is that which is called PREROG ATIVE. -  
  
This power, while employed for the benefit of the community,  
ard ſuitably to the truſt and ends of government, ts undoubred Pre-  
rogative, and never is queſtioned. For the people are very ſeldom  
or never ſcrupulous ot nice in the point, they are far from examin-

uſe it was meant, that is; for the good of the people, and not-mani-  
  
  
executive power and the people, about a thing claimed as a preroga-  
tive, the tendency of the exerciſe of ſuch prerogative to the good  
or hurt of the people, will eaſily decide the queſtion. Prerogative  
is nothing but the power of doing public good without a rule. The

Britain, or Lewis the French ing, if both were arbi⸗  
  
trary, as both would be, if hoth could levy taxes with-  
  
iii. 1  
Thbe firſt queſtion that would oceur to à philoſopher,  
if any queſtion could be made about it, would be whe-  
ther the poſition were true. But truth being af fittle  
. with moſt mottern politiclans, we ſhaff tough  
lig tly upon that topic, and proceed to inquiries, of 2  
more intereſting nature. 1  
  
That arbitrary goyernment implies the worſt of tem-  
poral evils, or at leaſt the continual danger of them is  
certain. That a man would be pretty equally ſub-  
jected to theſe evils under every arbitrary government,  
is clear, That ſhonld die very, ſoon after my head  
ſhould be cut off, whether by a ſabre or a broad fagrd,  
whether chopped oft to gratify a tyrant by the chriſ-  
tian name of 72, Dick or Harry is evident. That  
the name of the ryrant would be of no morg avail to  
  
-fave  
  
( 22 )  
  
fave my life than the name of the executioner, needs  
no Proof, It is therefore manifeſtly of no importance  
what a prince&#x27;s chriſtian name is, if he be arbitrary,any  
more, indeed, than if he were not arbitrary. So the  
whole amount of this dangerous propoſition may at  
leaſt in one view be reduced to this, viz. It is of little  
importance what a King&#x27;s chriſtian name is. It is in-  
deed of importance that a King, a Governor, and all  
other good chriſtians ſhould have a chriſtian name, but  
whether Edward, Francis or William, is of none, that I  
can diſcern, It being a rule to put the moſt mild and  
favourable conſtruction upon 3 that they can poſſi-  
bly bear, it will follow that this propoſition is a very  
harmleſs one, that cannot by any means tend to pre-  
judice his Majeſty&#x27;s Perſon, Crown, Dignity or Caufe,  
all which I deem equally ſacred with his Excellency.  
If this propoſition will bear an hundred different  
conſtructions, they muſt all be admitted before any that  
imports any bad meaning, much more a treaſonable one.  
t is conceived the houſe intended nothing diſreſpe&amp;-  
ful of His Majeſty, his Government or Governor, in  
thoſe words. It would be very injurious to inſinuate  
this of a houſe that upon all occaſions has diſtinguiſhed  
itſelf by a truly loyal ſpirit, and which ſpirit poſſeſſes  
at leaſt nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thouſand of  
their conſtituents throughout the province. One good  
natured conſtruction at leaſt ſeems to be implied in the  
aſſertion, and that pretty ſtrongly, viz. that in the pre-  
ſent ſituation of Great Britain and France, it is of vaſt  
importance to be a Briton, rather than a Frenchman  
as the French King is an arbitrary deſpotic Prince; but  
the King of Great Britain is not ſo de jure, Je fads,  
nor by znclination ; a greater difference on this ſide the  
Grave cannot be found, than that which ſubſiſts between  
Britiſh ſubjects, and the ſlaves of tyranny. |  
Pei ps it may be objected that there is ſome differ-  
ence even between arbitrary Princes in this reſpect at  
leaſt, that ſome are more rigotous than others. It is  
granted, but then let it be remembred, that the life of

man is as a vapour that ſoon vaniſheth away, and we  
know not who may come after him, a wiſe man or a  
fool; tho? the chances before and ſince Solomon, have  
ever been in favour of the latter. Therefore it is  
ſaid of little conſequence. Had it been No inſtead of  
little, the clauſe upon the moſt rigid ſtricture might  
have been found barely exceptionable.  
Some fine Gentlemen have charged the expreſſion  
as indelicate. This is a capital impeachment in poli-  
ticks, and therefore demands our moſt ſerious attention.  
The idea of delicacy in the creed of ſome politicians,  
implies that an inferior ſhould at the peril of. all that  
is near and dear to him (i. e. his intereſt) avoid every  
the leaſt trifle that can offend his ſuperior. Does my  
ſuperior want my eſtate ? I muſt give it him, and that  
with a good grace, which is appearing, and if poſlible  
being really obliged to him that he will condeſend to  
take it. The reaſon is evident; it might give him ſome  
little pain or uneaſineſs to ſee me whimpering, much  
more openly complaining at the loſs of a little glittering  
dirt. Td according to this ſyſtem not only endea-  
vour to acquire my ſelf, but impreſs upon all around  
me a reverence and paſſive obedience to the ſentiments  
of my ſuperior, little ſhort of adoration. Is the ſuperior  
in contemplatioq a king, I muſt conſider him as God&#x27;s  
vicegerent, cloathed with unlimited power, his will the  
ſupreme law, and not accountable for his actions, let  
them be what they may, to any tribunal upon earth.  
Is the ſuperior a plantation governor ? he muſt be view-  
ed not only as the moſt excellent repreſentation of ma-  
jeſty, but as a viceroy in his department, and quad  
rovincial adminiſtration,toall intents and purpoſes veſted  
with all the prerogatives that were ever exerciſed by the  
moſt abſolute prince in Great Britain.  
  
The votaries of this ſect are all Monopolizers of offi-  
ces, Peculators, Informers, and generally the Seekers  
of all kinds, It is better, ſay they, “to givetiup any  
thing, and every thing quietly, than contend with a ſu-

if you bid high enough, you are ſure of him”.  
To thoſe who have been taught to bow at the name

at the fight of x crucifis; .the aſſertion under examina-

| diſference  
  
„  
  
difference between the ſentiments of a Britiſh houſe of  
commons remonſtrating, and thoſe of a courtier cringing  
for a favour. A houſe of Repreſentarives here at leait,  
bears an equal proportion to a Governor, with that of a  
houſe of Commons to tne King. There is indeed one  
difference in favour of a houſe of Repreſearatives; when  
a houſe of Commons addreſs theKing,they ſpeak to their  
Sovereign, who is truly the moſt auguſt Perſonage upon  
carth : When a houſe of Repreſentatives remonſtrate  
to a Governor, they ſpeak to a fellow ſubject; tho&#x27; a  
ſuperior, who is undoubtedly intitled to decency and  
reſpect; but I hardly think to quite ſo much Reve-  
rence as his maſter, 3 |  
It may not be amiſs to obſerve, that a form of ſpeech .  
may be, in no ſort improper, when uſed arguendo, or  
for illuſtration, ſpeaking of the King, which ſame form  
might be very harſh, indecent and even ridiculous, if  
ſpoken to the King. | „  
The expreſſion under cenſure has had the approba-  
tion of divers Gentlemen of ſenſe, who are quite un-  
prejudiced by any party. They have taken it to imply  
a compliment rather than any indecent reflection, upon  
his Majeſty&#x27;s wiſe and gracious adminiſtration. It ſeems.  
ſtrange therefore that the houſe ſhould be ſo ſuddenly  
charged by his Excellency with Inpropriety, groundleſs  
Inſinuations, &amp;c. | | 1  
What cauſe of ſo bitter Repentance, again and  
again, could poſſibly have taken place, if this clauſe  
had been printed in the Journal, 1 imagine. If  
the caſe be fairly reprefented, I gueſs the province  
can be in no danger from a houſe of Repreſenta-  
tives daring to ſpeak plain Engliſh, when they are com-  
plaining of a grievance. I ſincerely believe the houſe  
had no diſpoſition to enter into any conteſt. with the  
Governor or Council. Sure I am that the promoters  
of this addreſs had no ſuch view. On the contrary,  
there is the higheſt reaſon to preſume that the houſe

Dear Tepor. In Mr. Wirt’s elegant and eloquent  
panegyric on Mr. Henry, I beg your attention to  
page 56, to page 67, the end of the second section,  
where you will read a curious specimen of the ago-  
nics of patriotism in the early stages of the revolu  
aeons Mr. Henry could carry his Tesolutions  
but by one vote, and that against the influence of  
Randolph, Bland, Pendleton, Whythe and all the  
old members, whose influence in the house had uli  
then been unbroken; and when Peyton Randolp),,  
afterwards president of congress, swore a round  
oath he would have given 500 guineas for a single  
vote, for one vote would have divided the house,  
snd Robinson was in the chair, who he knew would  
have negatived the resolution.  
  
And you wilb also see the confused manner in  
which they were ae ores and how they bave  
  
*n garbled in history.  
pore Bosch, at present will be confined to the  
anecdote in page 65.—“Cxsar had his Brutus,  
Charkes the first his Cromwell,andGeorge the third  
—Treason, cried the speaker—treason—treason—  
echoed from every part of the house. Henr; finish-  
ed his sentence, by the worcs—may profit by  
  
-eir example? —  
  
: otf this ie treason make the most of it.”  
  
In judge Minot’s history of Massachusctis bay,  
vol. Uf, paces 102 and 103, you will find another  
agony of puiriotism in 1762, three years betore Mr.  
Henty’s. Mr. Otis suffered oneof equal severity  
  
  
  
‘bay. Judge Minot’s account of it is this: “The  
  
emonstrance offered-to the governor was attended  
with aggravating eircumstances. It was passed, af-  
tera very warm speech by: a member in the house,  
and at first contained the following offensive ob-  
servation—‘lor it will beof little consequence to  
the people whether they were subject to George  
or Louis, the king of Great Britain or the French  
king. If both were arbitrary, as both would be, if  
both could levy taxes without parliament.”  
  
Though judge Minot does not say it, the warm  
speech was from the tongue, and the offensive ob.  
servation from the pen of James Otis.—When  
these words of the remonstrance were first read  
in the house, Timothy Pain, esq. a member from  
Worcester, in his zeal for royalty, cried out “trea-  
son! treason!”—the house were not however inti-  
midated, but voted the remonstrance with all the  
treason contained in it, by a large majority—and it  
was presented to the governor bya committee of  
which Mr. Otis was a member—Judge Minot pro-  
ceeds: ‘The governor was so displeased with this  
passage that he sent a letter to the speaker, return-  
ing the message of the house, in which he said  
that the king’s name, dignity and cause, were so  
improperly treated, that he’ was obliged to desire  
the speaker to recommend earnestly to the house  
that it might not be entered upon the minutes, in  
the terms in which it then stood. For ifit should,  
he was satisfied they would again, and again, wish  
that some part of it were expunged.—Especially if  
it should appear, as he doubted not it would when  
he entered upon his vindication—that there was  
not the least ground for the insinuation, under co-  
lor of which that sacred and well beloved name  
was so disrespectfully brought into question.—  
Upen the reading of this letter, the exceptionable  
clause was struck out of the message.” —  
  
I have now before mea pamphlet printed in 1762,  
by Edes and Gill, in Q.:een street, Boston, entitled  
*‘A vindicaiion of the conduct of the house of re-  
presentatives of the province of the Massachusetts  
bay; more particularly in the last session of the  
general assembly—by James Otis, esq. a member  
of said house,” with this motto  
  
Let sueh, such only, tread this sacred floor,  
Who dare to love their country, and be poor;  
Or good, tho’ rich, humane and wise, tho’ great,  
Jove give but these, we’ve nought to fear from fate.  
I wish I couid transeribe the whole of this pamph.  
  
let, because itis a document of importance in the  
early history of the revolution which ought never  
to be forgotten.—It shows in a strong light the  
heaves and throes of the burning mountain, three  
years at least beforethe explosion of the volcano  
in Massachusetts or Virgivia. Had judge Minot  
ever seen ‘his pamphlet, could he have given so su-  
perficial an account of this year, 1762? There was  
more than one “warm speech” made in that session  
of the legislature.— Mr. Otis, himself, made many—  
a dark cloud hung over the whole continent,—but  
it was peculiarly black and threatening over Mas-  
sachusetts and the town of Boston, against which  
devoted city the first thunderbolt of parliamentary  
omnipotence were intended and expected to be  
darted. Mr. Otis, from his first appearance in the  
house in 1761, had shewn such a vast superiority of  
‘talents, information and energy to every other mem-  
ber of the house, that, in 1762, be took the lead as it  
were of course. He opened the session with a  
speech. Asketch of which he has given us him-  
self. It depends upon no man’s memory. It is  
warm, it is true;—But i. is warm only with leyalty  
to his king, love to his country, and exultations.in

This pamphlet ought to be reprinted and deposi:  
ed in the cabinet of the curious. The preface 1s a  
frank, candid and manly page, explaining the mo-  
tive of the publication, viz. the clamors against  
the house for their proceedings, in which he truly  
says, “the world ever has been, and ever will be,  
pretty equally divided between those two grea  
parties, vulgarly called the winners and the los-  
ers; or, tospeak more precisely, between those who  
are discontented that they have no power, and those  
who think they never can have enough”—Now It  
it absolutely impossible to please both sides, either  
by temporizing, trimming or retreating; the for-  
mer, justly incurthe censureof a wicked heart,  
the latter that of cowardice, and fairly and man-  
fully fighting the battle out, is inthe opinion of  
many worse than either.  
  
On the 8th of Sentember, A. D. 1762,—the war  
still continuing in North America and the West  
Indies, governor Bernard made his speech to both  
houses, and presented a requisition of sit Jeffery  
Amherst, that the Massachusetts troops should be  
continued in pay during the winter. :  
  
Mr. Otis made a speech, the outlines of which he  
has recorded in the pamphlet, urging a compliance  
with the governor’s recommendation and general  
Amhers(’s requisition; and concluding with a motion  
for a committee to consider of both. A committee  
was appointed, of whom Mr. Otis was one, and re-  
ported, not only acontinuance of the troops alrea-  
dy in service, but an addition of nine hundred men  
with an augmented bounty to encourage their en-  
  
listment. If the orators, on the 4th of July, really  
wish to investigate the principles and feelings  
which produced the revolution, they ought to stu-  
dy this pamphlet and Dr. Mayhew’s sermon on pas  
sive obedience and non-resistance, and all the docu-  
ments of those days. They have departed from the  
object of their institution as much as the society  
for propagation of the gospel in foreign parts have  
from their charter. The institution had better be  
wholly abolished, than continued an engine of the  
politics and feelings of the day, instead of a memo.  
rial of the principles and feelings of the revolution  
half a century ago--I might have said for two cen-  
turies before.  
  
This pamphlet of Mr. Otis exhibits the interest-  
ing spectable of a great man, glowing with loyalty  
to his sovereign, proud of his connection with the  
British empire, rejoicing in its prosperity, its tri-  
umphs and ‘its glory, exulting in the unexampled  
efforts of his own native province to promete them  
all; but at the same time grieving and complaining  
of the ungenerous treatment that province had re:  
-céived from its beginning from the mother country,  
and shuddering under the prospect of still greater  
ingratitude and cruelty from the same source.  
Hear a few of his words and read all the rest.  
  
“Mr. Speaker—This province has upon all occa-  
sions been distinguished by its loyalty and readi-  
ness to contribute its most strenuous efforts for his  
Taajesty’s service; ] hope this spirit will ever re-  
main asan indelible ‘characteristic of this people,  
&amp;c.&amp;c. “Our own immediate interest, therefore,  
as wellas the general cause of our king and coun-  
try, requires that we should contribute the last  
penny and the last drop of blood, rather than by any  
backwardness. of ours, Lis majesty’s measures  
should be embarrassed; and thereby any of the en-  
terprizes that may be planned for the regular troops  
miscarry. Some of these considerations I presume  
induced the assembly, upon: his majesty’s requisi-  
tion, signified last spring by lor. Egremont, so  
cheerfully and unanimously to raise thirty-three  
  
  
  
hundred more into the regular service

The co-  
lonies, we know, have often been blamed without  
cause; and we have had some share of it—witness  
the miscarriage of the pretended expedition against  
Canada in queen Anne’s time, just before the infam-  
ous treaty of Utrecht. Itis well known by some  
now living in this metropolis, that every article,  
that was to be provided iiere, was in such readiness,  
that the officers, both of the army and navy, expres-  
sed their utmost surprize atit, upon their arrival.  
To some of them, no doubt, it was a disappoint-  
ment; for in order to shift the blame of this shame-  
ful affair from themselves, they endeavoured to lay  
it upon the New Eng. colonies. lam therefore clear-  
ly for raising the men, &amp;c. This province has, since  
the year 1754, levied for his majesty’s service ay:  
soldiers and seamen, near thirty thousand men,  
besides what have been otherwise employed. One  
year in particular it was said that every fifth man  
was engaged in one shape or another. We have  
raised sums for the support of this war, that the  
last generation could hardly have formed any idea  
of. We are deeply in debt.”  
  
On the 14th of September the house received a  
message from the governor, containing a somewhat  
awkward confession of certain expenditures of pub.  
lic money, without appropriations by the represen-  
taiives of tlie people,—‘hat such appropriations  
were unconsiitutional, arbitrary, and therefore ty-  
ranical, had became popular proverbs—they were  
become common place-observations in the streets.  
It was impossible that Otis should not take fire  
upon this message of the governer. He according-  
ly did take fire and made that flaming speech  
which judge Minot calls “a wanm spreca”—with.  
out informing us who made it, or what it contain.  
ed. I wish, Mr. Otis had given us this ‘*warm  
speech,” ashe has the comparatively coo! one at  
the opening of the session. But this is lost forever.  
It concluded, however, with a motion for a com.  
mittee to consider the governor’s message and re-  
port. The committee was appointed and Otis was  
the first after the speaker,  
  
Tie cominittee reported the following answer  
and remonstrance, every syllable of which is Otis.  
  
‘May it please your excellency:  
  
“The house have duly attended to your ex¢ellen-  
cy’s message of the eleventh instant, relating to  
tiie Massachusetts’ sloop, and are humbly of opinion  
that there is not the least necessity for keeping up  
her present complement of men, and therefore de.  
sire that your excellency would be pleased to re-  
duce them to six} the old establishment made fur

selves, and to our constituents obliges us to remon-

establishments by the governor and council. It i-,

privilege, the right of originating all taxes.  
  
“It is, in short, annibilatiag one branch of the  
legislature—and when once the representatives of  
the people give up this privilege, the government  
will very soon become arbitrary.  
  
“No necessity, therefore, can be snflicient to  
justify a house of representatives in giving up such  
a privilege; for it would be of little consequence  
to the people, whether they were subject to George  
or Louis, the king of Great Britain, or the Frenc);

both could levy taxes without parliament. Had

not have troubled your excellency about it; but  
Jest the matter should grow into precedent, we  
earnestly beseech your excellency, as you regard  
the peace and welfare of the province, that no  
measures of this nature be taken for the future, let  
the advice of council be what it may,”’ |  
This remonstrance being read was accepted by  
a large majority, and sent up and presented to his  
excetlency by a committee, of whom Mr. Ovis was  
one.  
The same day the above remonstrance was de-  
livered, the town was alarmed with a report, that  
the house had sent a message to his excgliency re-  
flecting on his majesty’s person and government,  
and highly derogatory to his crown and dignity,  
and therein advised that his excellency would, in no  
case, take advice of his ha council. The  
grovernor’s letter to the speaker is as judge Minot  
represented it. Upon reading it, the same person  
who bad before cried out treason! treason! when  
he first heard the offensive words, now cried out  
‘‘rase them! rase them!’? They were accordingly  
  
expunged.  
  
In the course of the debate, a new and surpris-  
ing doctrine was advanced: ‘We have seen the  
times, when the majority of a council by their  
words and actions have seemed to think themselves  
obliged to comply with every thing proposed by  
the chair, and to have norule of conduct but a go-  
vernor’s will and pleasure. But now, for the first  
time, it was asserted, that the governor, in all ca-  
ses, was obliged to act according to the advice of  
council, and consequently would be deemed to  
have no judgment of his own.  
  
In page 17, Mr. Otis enters on his apology, ex-  
cuse or justification of the offensive words; which,  
us itis ag facetious as it is edifying, I will tran-  
scribe at length in his own words, viz.—  
  
“In order to excuse, if not altogether justify, the  
offensive passages and clear it from ambiguity, I  
beg leave to premise, two or three data:—Ist. God  
made all men naturally equal. 2d. The ideas of  
earthly superiority, pre-eminence and grandeur are  
educational; at least acquired, not innate. 3d.  
kings were, and plantation goveruors should be,  
made for the sabi of the people, and not the peo-  
ple forthem: 4th. No government has a right to  
make hobby horses, asses and slaves of the subject;  
nature having made sufficient of the former, for  
all the lawful purposes of man, from the harmless  
peasant in the field, to the most refined politician  
in the cabinet; but none of the last, which infallibly  
proves they are unnecessary. Sth. Though most  
governments are de facto arbitrary, and consequent-  
ly the curse of and scandal of human nature, yet  
none are de jure, arbjtrary. 6th. The British con.  
stitution of government, as now established in his  
majesty’s person and family, 1s the wisest and best  
in the world, 7th. The king of Great Britain is  
the best and most glorious monarch wpon the  
globe, and his subjects the happiest in the universe.  
Sth. It is most humbly presumed, the king would  
have all his plantation governors follow his royal  
example, in wise and strict adherence to the prin-  
ciples of the British constitution; by which, in con-  
junction with his other royal virtues, he is enabled  
to reign in the hearts of abrave and generous, a free  
and loyal people. 9th. This is the summit, the  
ne plus ultra of human glory and felicity. 10th.  
The French king is a degpotic, arbitrary prince, and  
consequently his subjecis are very miserable.  
  
‘Let us now take a more careful review of this  
passage, which by some, out-of-doors, has been re-  
presented as seditious, rebellious and traitorous.  
  
&gt;  
~  
  
I hope none, however, will be so wanting to the in,  
terests of their country as to represent the matte  
ip this light on the east side of the Atlantic, though  
recent instances of such a conduct might be quot-  
ed, wherein the province has, after its most stre-  
nuous efforts, during this and other wars, been  
painted in all the odious colors that avarice, ma-  
lice and the worst passions could suggest.  
  
‘“‘The house assert, that it would be of little con-  
sequence to the people, whether they were sub-  
ject to George or Louis, the king of Great Britain  
or the French king, if both were arbitrary, as both  
would be, if both could levy taxes without parlia-  
ment—or in the same vvords transposed without the  
least alteration of the sense: It would be of little  
consequence to the people whether they were sub-  
ject to George, the king of Great Britain, or Louis,  
the French king, if both were, arbitrary, as both  
would be, if both could levy taxes without parlia-  
‘ment,  
  
“The first question that would occur to a philo-  
sopher, if any question could be made about it,  
would be, whether it were true. But truth being  
of little importance, with most modern politicians,  
we shall touch lightly on that topic, and proceed  
to an enquiry of a more interesting nature.  
| “That arbitrary government implies the worst of  
temporary evils, or at least the continual daigers  
of them, is certain. ‘That a man would be pretty  
equally subject to these evils, under every arbitra-  
ry government, is clear. That I should die very  
soon after my head should be cut off, whether by  
a sabre or a broad-sword, whether chopped off to  
gratify a tyrant, by the christian name of Tom,  
Dick or Harry, is evident. That the name of the  
tyrant would be of no more avail to save my life,  
than the name of the executioner, needs no proof  
—It is therefore manifestly of no importance what  
a prince’s christian name is, if he be arbitrary, any  
more indeed if he were not arbitrary. So the  
| whole amount of this dangerous proposition may  
at least in one view be reduced to this, viz:—1T 1s  
OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE WHAT A KING’S CHRISTIAN  
NAME 1S. It is indeed of importance that a king,  
a governor, and all other good christians, should  
have a christian name, but whether Edward, Fran-  
cis, or William, is of none, that I can discern. It  
being arule to put the most mild and favorable  
construction upon words that they can possibly  
bear, it will follow that this proposition is a very  
harmless one, that cannot by any means tend to  
prejudice his majesty’s person, crown, dignity, or  
Cause, all which I deem equally sacred with his  
excellency.  
  
“If this proposition will bear an hundred differ-  
ent constructions, they must all be admitted before  
any that imports any bad meaning, much more @  
treasonable one.  
  
“It is conceived the house intend nothing disre-  
spectful of his majesty, his goyepnment or gover-  
nor, in thase words. Jt would bé very injurious to  
insinuate this of a house that, wpon all occasions,  
has distinguished itself by a truly loyal spirit; and  
which spirit possesses at least nine hundred and  
ninety-nine in a thousand of their constituents  
throughout the province. One good natured con-  
struction at least seems to be implied in the asser-  
tion and that pretty strongly, viz:—that in the pre-  
sent situation of Great Britain and France, it is of  
vast importance to be a Briton rather thana French-  
man, as the French king is an arbitrary, despotic  
prince—but the king of Great Britain is not so de  
jure, de facto, nor by inclination; a greater differ-  
  
  
  
ence on this side of the grave cannot be found,

than that which subsists between British subjects  
and the slaves of tyranny. t  
  
Perhaps it may be objected, that there is some  
difference even between arbitrary princes, in this  
respect at least, that some are more vigorous than  
others. Itis grdnted; but then let it be remember-  
ed that the life of man is as a vapor that soon va-  
nisheth away, and we know not who may come af-  
ter him, a wise man or a fool; though the chances  
before and since Solomon have ever been in favor of  
the latter. ‘Therefore it is said to be of little conse-  
quence. Had it been no instead of little, the  
clause, upon the most rigid stricture, might have  
been found barely exceptionable.  
  
‘Some fine gentlemen have charged the expres-  
sion as indelicate. This is a capital impeachment  
in politics, and therefore demands our most serious  
attention. The idea of delicacy, in the creed of  
some politicians, implies that an inferior should, at  
the peril of all that is near and dear, obey his su-  
perior. Does my superior want my estate? I must  
give it him, and bow to him that he will conde-  
scend to take it.  
  
“‘The reason is evident: it might give him some  
little pain or uneasiness to see me whimpering,  
much more openly complaining, at the loss of a  
little glittering dirt. I must, according to this  
system, not only endeavor to acquiesce myself, but  
impfess upon all around me, a reverence and pas  
sive obedience to the sentiments of my superior,  
little short of adoration. Is the superior in con-  
templation a king, I must consider him as God’s  
vicegerent, clothed with unlimited power, his will  
the supreme law, and not accountable for his ac-  
tions, let them bé what they may, to any tribunal  
upon earth. Is the superior a plantation governor?  
He must be viewed not only as the most excel-  
lent representation of majesty, but as a vice roy in  
his department, quoad provincial administration,  
to all intents and purposes vested with all the pre-  
rogatives that were ever exercised by the most  
absolute prince in Great Britain.  
  
“The votaries of this sect, are all monopolizers  
of office, peculators, informers, and generally the  
seekers of all kinds—It is better, say they, to give  
up any thing and every thing quietly than contend  
with a superior; who, by his prerogative, can do,  
and as the vulgar express it, right or wrong, will  
have, whatever he pleases. For you must know,  
that according to some of the most refined and  
fashionable systems of modern politics, the ideas  
of right and wrong, and all the moral virtues, are  
to be considered only as the vagaries of a weak or  
distempered imagination in the possessor, and of  
no use in the world but for the skilful politician, to  
convert to his own purposes of power and profit ,—  
with these—  
  
“The love of country is an empty name,  
  
“For gold they hunger; but ne’er thirst for fame.”  
  
“It is well known that the least patriotic spark,  
‘unawares catched,” and discovered, disqualifies  
a candidate from all,further preferment in this fa-  
mous and fiourishing order of knights errant. It  
must however be confessed they are so catholic as  
to admit all sorts, from the knights of the post to a  
garter and star, provided they are thoroughly di-  
vested of the fear of God and the love of mankind;  
and have concentrated all their views in dear self,  
with them the only sacred and well beloved name,  
or thing, in the universe.—See Cardinal Richelieu’s  
political Testament, and the greater Bible of the  
sect, Mandeville’s fable of the bees, Richelieu,  
expressly in solemn earnest, without aay sarcasm  
or irony, advises the discarding all honest men  
from the presence of a prince, and from even the  
  
  
  
—  
  
  
  
—o  
  
purlieus of a court. According to Mandeville—  
the moral virtues are the political offspring which  
flattery begot upon pride. The most darling prin-  
ciple of this great apostle of the order, who has  
done more than any mortal towards diffusing cor-  
ruption, not only through the three kingdoms, but  
through the remotest dominions, is that every man  
hasghis price, and that if you bid high enough,  
you are sure of him. .  
  
“To those who have been taught to bow at tlic  
name of a king, with as much ardor and devotior,  
as a papist at the sight of a erucifix, the assertion  
under examination may appear harsh; but there is  
an immense difference between the sentiments of a Bri-  
tish house of commons remonstrating, and those of a  
courtier cringing fora favor. A house of represen-  
tatives here, at least, bears an equal proportion ta a  
governor, with that of a house of commons to a king. —  
There is indeed one difference in tavor of a house  
of representatives; when ahouse of commons ac-  
dress the king, they speak to their sovereign, who  
is truly the most august personage upon earth:  
When a house of representatives remonstrate to a  
governor, they speak toa fellow subjeci; though a  
superior, who is undoubtedly entitled to decency  
and respect; but I hardly think to quite so much  
reverence as his master.  
  
“It may not be amiss to observe, that a form of.  
speech may be in no sort improper, when used  
arguendo or for illustration, speaking of the king;  
which same form may be very harsh, indecent and  
ridiculous if spoken to the king.  
  
“What cause of so bitter repentance, “again  
and again,” could possibly have taken place, if  
this clause bad been printed in the journal, Lean-  
not imagine; if the case be fairly represented, I  
guess the province can be in no danger from a house  
of representatives daring to speak plain English  
when they are complaining of a grievance. I sin-  
cerely believe the house had no dispostion to enter  
into any with the governor or council. Sure I am  
that the promoters of this address had no such  
view. On the contrary, there is the highest reason  
to presume that the house of representatives will  
at all times rejoice in the prosperity of the gover-  
nor and council, and contribute their utmost as-  
Sistance, in supporting those two branches of the  
legislature in all their just rights and pre-emi-  
nence.—But the house is, and’eught to be, jealous  
and tenacious of its own privileges; these are a sa-  
cred deposit intrusted by the people, and the jealousy of  
them is a Godly jealously.”  
  
REMARKS. |  
  
1. Why has the sublime compiiment of “treason!  
treason!” made to Mr. Henry in 1765, been so  
celebrated, when that to Mr. Otis, in 1762, threc.  
years before, has been forgotten? Because the Vir-  
  
| ginia patriot has had many trumpeters, and very  
  
loudones; but the Massachusetts patriot none.—~  
Though false accusers and vile columniators in  
abundance.  
  
2. I know not whether judge Minot was born in  
1762. He certainly never saw, heard, felt or un-  
derstood any thing of the principles or feelings of  
that year. If he had, he could not have given so  
frosty an account of it. “I&#x27;he warm speech” he  
mentions, was an abridgment or second edition of  
Otis’s argument, in 1761, against the execution of  
the acts of trade. It was a flaming declamaiion  
against taxation without representation. It was a  
warning voicé against the calamities that were  
coming on his country. [t was an ardent effort to  
alarm and arouse his countrymen against the me-  
nacing system of parliamentary taxation.

sult to truth, virtue and patriotism, to represent  
Patrick Henry, though he was my friend as much  
as Otis, as the father of the. American revolution,  
and the founder of American independence? The  
gentleman who has done this, sincerely believed  
what he wrote,3 doubt not; but he ought to be  
made sensible that heis of yesterday, and knows  
nothing of the real origin of the American revolu-  
tion.  
  
7. If there is any bitterness of spirit discernable  
  
ian Mr. Otis’ vindication, this was not natural to him.  
—~He was generous, candid, manly, social, friendly,  
agreeable, amiable, witty and gay, by nature, and  
by habit. Honest, almost to a proverb; though  
quick and passionate against meanness and deceit.  
But at this time he was agitated by anxiety for his  
country, and irritated by a torrent of slander and  
scurrility constantly pouring upon him from all ‘  
  
uarters.—Mr. Q:is has fortified his vindication in  
along and learned note.—Which, in mercy to my  
eyes and fingers, I must borrow another hand to  
transcribe in another sheet:—  
  
“The natural liberty of man js to be free from  
any superior power on earth, and not tobe under  
the will or legislative authority of man, but to have  
only the law of nature for hisrule. The liberty of  
inan in society is to be under no other legislative  
power, but that established by consent in the com-  
monwealth; nor under the dominion of any will,  
or restrainst of any law, but what that leyisiatyre  
  
~ ghall enact according to the trust putin it. Free-  
  
dom then is not what sir Robert Filmer tells us,—  
“A liberty for eyery one to do what he lists,  
to live as he pleases, and not to he tried by any  
laws.” But freedom of men, under government,  
is to have a standing rule to live by, common to  
every one of that society, and made by the legis  
tative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my  
own will, in all things where that rule prescribes  
not, and pot. to be subject to the unknown, uncon-  
stant, uncertain, arbitrary will of another man; a  
freedom of nature is to be under no restrains: but  
the law of nature. This freedom from absolute  
arbitrary powe;, is so necessary to, and closely  
joined with a man’s preservation, that le cannot  
part with it but by what forfeits his preservation  
and life together. Fora man not having power  
over his own life, cannot by compact or his own  
consent enslave bimself to any one, nor put himself  
  
take away his life when he pleass: no body can  
give more power than he has himself. He that  
cannot take away his own life, cannot give another  
power over it.”’—Locke’s discourse on government,  
part 2d, chap, 4. :  
  
“Though the legislative, whether placed in one  
or more, whether it be always in being, or only by.  
intervals, though it be the supreme power in every  
commonwealth, yetin the utmost bounds of it, if it  
be limited to the public good of the society, it is @  
power that hath no end but preservation; and those  
can never have a right to destroy, enslave or design -  
  
|edly impoverish the subjects.  
  
“These are the bounds to which the trust that is  
put in them by the society and the laws of God and  
nature, have set to the legislative power of every -  
commonwealth in all forms of government:  
  
“First, they are to govern by established promul-  
gated laws, not to be: varied in particular cases but  
to have ene rule for rich and poor, for the favorite  
at court, and the countryman at plough.  
  
*‘Secondly, these taws ought to be designed for  
no other end ultimately, but the good of the people.  
  
“Thirdly, they must not raise taxes on the proper-.  
ty of the people, without the consent of the people,  
given by themselves or deputies.”  
  
“‘Fourthiu, the legislature neither must nor can  
transfer the power, of making laws to any-body else,  
nor place any where but where the people bave.””  
  
Ld chap 11.  
  
‘Where the legislative and executive power are  
in distinct hands, as they are in ell moderated  
monarchies and well formed governments, there  
the good of society requires that several things  
should be left to the discretion of him that has  
the supreme executive power. This power to act  
according to discretion for the public good, with-  
out the prescription of law, and sometimes even  
against it, is that which is called prerogative.  
  
‘This power, which employed for the benefit of  
the community, and suitably to the trust and ends  
‘of government, is undoubted prerogative, and never  
is questioned. For the people are very seldom or  
neyer scrupulous or nice in the point; they are far  
from examining prerogative whilst it is in any  
tolerable degree employed for the use it Was meant,  
that is, for the good of the people, and not mani-  
festly against it. But if there comes to be a ques-  
tion between the executive power and the people,  
about a thing claimed as a prerogative, the tenden-  
cy of the exercise of such prerogative to the good  
or hurt of the people, will easily decide the ques-  
tion. Prerogative is nothing but the power of do-  
ing public good without a rule. The old question  
willbe asked in this matter of prerogative. But  
who shall be judge when this power is made a  
right use of? lL answer: between an executive pow-  
er in being with such prerogative, anda legisla-  
tive, that depends upon his will, further convening,  
there can beno judge on earth, us there can be  
none between the legislative and the people. Should  
either the executive or legislative, when they have  
got this power in their hands, design or go about  
\o destroy them, the people have no other remedy  
in this, as in other cases—when they have no judge  
upon earth, but to appeal to heaven. Nor léetany  
one think that this lays a perpetual foundation for  
disorder—for this operates not till the inconveni-  
ency is so great that the majority feel it, aud are  
weary of it, and find u necessity to have it. amend-  
ed. But this the executive power or wire princes  
never need come inthe danger of, and it is the  
  
  
  
thing of all others, they have most need to avoid,

terms should be enjoyed by the vuigar.  
  
‘These may be inclined to brand some of the  
principles advanced in the vindication of the house,  
with odious epithets, seditious and levelling. Had  
any thing io justify them been quoted from col.  
Algernon Sidney, or other British martyrs to the  
liberty of their country, an outcry of rebellion  
would not be surprising. The authority of Mr.  
Locke has therefore been prefered to all others—for  
these further reasons—1st He was not only one of  
the most wise, as well as most honest, but the mosa  
impartial man that ever lived. 2d. He professed.  
ly wrote his discourses on government, as he him-  
self expresses it: —“To establish the throne of. the  
great restorer king William, to make good his title  
in the consent of the people, which being the only  
one of all lawful governments, he had more fully  
and clearly, than any prince in christendom, and  
to justify to the world the people of England, whose  
love of liberty, their just and natural rights, with  
their resolution to preserve them, saved the nation  
when it was on the brink of slavery and ruin.” By  
this title our illustrious sovereign, George the IL.

Locke was as great an ornament, under a crowned

‘*Had all her sons been of his wise, moderate, to-  
lerant principles, we should probably never have  
heard of those civil dissentions that have so often  
brought the nation to the borders of perdition.—  
Upon the score of his being a churchman, however,  
his sentiments are less liable to the invidious re-  
flectionsjand insinuations that high flyers, jacobites  
and other stupid bigots, are apt too liberally to be-  
stow, not only upon dissenters of all degominations,  
but upon the moderate, and therefore infinitely the

Sire, to lay before you a passage from the doctrine of Locke, on the  
prerogative of the king, in order that you may undeceive yourself  
us to the non-criminality of the third charge alleged against the  
Cortes of Cadiz.  
  
“When the legislative and executive powers are in different  
hands (as they are in all limited monarchies, and in all other well-  
constituted governments) the good of the community requires that  
several things should be left to the discretion of him who holds the  
ereculive power; for as the legislators cannot foresee every thing  
which may be useful to the public, and consequently not being able  
to provide laws for all cases, he who is entrusted with the execution of  
them, having the power in his hands, by the law of nature, has a  
right to make use of it in whatever may benefit the community

Sir. R. Filmer had defined liberty to be a right ‘‘ for every one to  
do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tyed by any  
laws :&quot;’ in Opposition to this Mr. Locke says, ‘‘ the natural liberty of  
man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be  
under the will, or legislative authority of man; and the liberty of  
man in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that  
established, by consent, in the Common Wealth, not under the do-  
minion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legis-  
lature shall enact; not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain,  
unknown, arbitrary will of another man.” This freedom from  
arbitrary power, being necessary to the preservation of life, Mr,  
Locke contends, a man cannot subject himself to it, ‘* because he that  
cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it.’&quot;—  
He adds, :  
  
“ I confess, we find among the Jews, as well as other nations,  
that men did sell themselves ; but &#x27;tis plain, this was only to drud-  
gery, not to slavery. For, it is evident, the person sold was not un-  
der an absolute, arbitrary, despotical power. For the master could  
ot have the power to idl him, at any time, whom, ata certain

man, In the language of John Locke, is &quot;to be   
free from any superior power on earth, and   
not to be under the will or legislative author­  
ity of mon, but to have only the law of nation   
for his rule,&quot; this is simply the liberty of the   
savage. The rod Indian knows no higher lib­  
erty than that..   
But the higher idea, which ensues upon a   
more advanced civilization and culture, Is that   
of social liberty—the liberty of man In society,   
which to the liberty secured by statute.   
&quot;The liberty,&quot; no John Locke has said, &quot;of   
being ender no other legislative) power but   
that established, by consent, In the Common­  
wealth, nor under tile dominion of any will or   
restrnlnt of any law, but what that legislative   
shall enact according to the trust put la it.&quot;   
And here the main idea is, that a true social   
liberty is begotten of law. It Is no longer the

It was in this debate that Mr. Henry, treating

house: “Tarquin and Cesar had each his  
Brutus, Charles I. his Cromwell, and George

“ Treason! Treason!” echoed from every part

for those to which alone the people have  
seen fit to confide this sovereign trust.’ ’’  
“Mr. Locke, in his work on civil govern­  
ment, says:  
&quot; ‘These are the bounds which the trust  
that is put in them by the society and the  
law of God and nature, have eet to the  
legislative power of every commonwealth,  
in all forms of government:  
&quot; ‘First—They are to govern by promul­  
gated, established laws, not to be varied in  
particular cases, but to have one .rule for  
rich and poor, for the favorite at court  
and the countryman at the plough.’  
&quot; ‘Second—These laws also ought to be  
designed for no other end ultimately, but  
the good of the people.&#x27;  
&quot; ‘Third—They must not raise taxes on  
the property of the people without the con­  
sent of the people, given by themselves or  
their deputies. And this properly concerns  
only such governments where the legisla­  
tive is always in being, or, ai. least, where  
the people have not reserved any part of  
the legislative to deputies, to be from time  
to time chosen by themselves.’  
&quot; ‘Fourth—The legislative neither must  
nor can transfer the power of making lavvo  
to anybody else, or place it anywhere but  
where the people have.’  
&quot;It would seem from these constitutional  
provisions, and from the quotations that I  
have made from these eminent constitu­  
tional writers, that it was the intention of  
tiie lawmakers that the legislature alone  
should pass laws for the government of all  
persons end all interests within the state  
of Alabama, and that this power and duty  
should not he transferred to any other per­  
son or power.  
&quot;It was also undoubtedly contemplated  
that before any rule or law could become  
obligatory, or in any way binding upon the  
people, or any portion of the people, tha
