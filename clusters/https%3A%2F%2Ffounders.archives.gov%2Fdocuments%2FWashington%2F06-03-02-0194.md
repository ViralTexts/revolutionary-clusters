The friends of Government, who are anxious to maintain its Neutrality, and to preserve the Country in Peace; and to adopt measures to produce these desirable ends are charged by them, as being Monarchists—Aristocrats—&amp; Infractors of the Constitution; which, according to their interpretation of it, would be a mere cypher; while they, arrogated to themselves (until the eyes of the People began to discover how outrageously they had been treated in their Commercial concerns by the directory of France, and that that was a ground on which they could no longer tread) the sole merit of being the Friends of Fr

stances as it unfolds.  
You have expressed a wish, worthy the benevolence of your heart, that I would exert all my endeavors to avert the calamatous effects of a rupture between our Countries. Believe me, my dear friend, that no man can deprecate a measure of this sort with more horror than I should—that no one, during the whole of my Administration, laboured more incessantly, &amp; with more sincerity &amp; zeal than I did, to avoid this, and to render every justice—nay favor to France—consistent with the Neutrality which had been proclaimed to the World; Sanctioned by Congress; and approved by the State Legislatures and the People at large in their Town &amp; County meetings. But Neutrality was not the point at which France was aiming; for whilst it was crying Peace—Peace—and pretending that they did not wish us to be embroiled in their quarrel with Great Britain, they were pursuing measures in this Country so repugnant to its Sovereignty, and so incompatible with every principle of Neutrality, as must, inevitably, have produced a War with the latter. And when they found that the Government here, was resolved to adhere steadily to its plan of Neutrality, their next step  
  
was to destroy the confidence of the People in, &amp; to seperate them from it; for which purpose their Diplomatic Agents were specially Instructed; and in the attempt were aided by inimical characters among ourselves; not as I observed before because they loved France better than any other Nation, but because it was an instrument to facilitate the destruction of their own Government.  
Hence proceeded

t to be inferred from hence that they will suffer any Nation under the Sun (while they retain a proper sense of Virtue &amp; Independence) to trample upon their rights with impunity; or to direct, or influence the internal concerns of their Country.  
It has been the policy of France, and that of the opposition party amongst ourselves, to inculcate a belief that all those who have exerted themselves to keep this Country in Peace, did it from an overweening attachment to Great Britain. But it is a solemn truth, and you may count upon it, that it is void of foundation; and  
  
propagated for no other purpose than to excite popular clamour against those whose aim was peace, and whom they wished out of their way.  
That there are many amongst us who wish to see this country embroiled on the side of Great Britain—and others who are anxious that we should take part with France against her, admits of no doubt. But it is a fact on which you may entirely, and absolutely rely, that the Governing Powers of the Country, &amp; a very large part of the People, are true Americans in principle; attached to the interests of it; and unwilling, under any circumstances whatsoever, to participate in the Politics, or contests of Europe: Much less since they have found that France, having forsaken the ground she first took, is interfering in the internal concerns of all Nations, Neutral as well as Belligerent, and setting the world in an uproar.  
After my Valadictory Address to the People of the United States, you would, no doubt, be somewhat surprised to hear that I had again consented to gird on the Sword. But having struggled eight or nine years against the Invasion of our Rights by one Power, &amp; to establish an Independence of it, I could not remain an unconcerned Spectator of the attempts of another Power to accomplish the same object, though in a different way, with less pretensions—indeed without any at all.  
On the Politics of Europe, I shall express no opinion; nor make any enquiry who is right, or who is wrong. I wish well to all Nations, and to all men. My politics are plain &amp; simple. I think every Nation has a right to establish that form of government under which It conceives It shall live most happy, provided it infracts no Right, or is not dangerous to others. And that, no governments ought to interfere with the internal concerns of another, except for the security of what is due to themselves.  
I sincerely hope that Madame la Fayette will accomplish all her wishes in France, and return safe to you wit

consistent with the neutrality which had been proclaimed^

France was aiming; for, whilst they were crying Pence,

But it is a fact,&#x27; on which you may entirely rely, that
