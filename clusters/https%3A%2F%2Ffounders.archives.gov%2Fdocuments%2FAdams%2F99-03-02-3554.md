The Judge hath told us that the hour is coming when all that are in the graves shall come forth; they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.”But it is the good man only, the sincere and upright Christian who can look into futurity with comfort and with hope.To the unfaithful and disobedient the grave must be the avenue to indescribable sorrow.

enjoy all their ineffable realities in all the splendor of heaven those incorruptable rewards which no mortal eye hath seen, nor ear heard Nor human thought conceived. Blessed are the dead which die in the lord for they rest from their labors and their works do follow them.”In this blessedness we have reason to believe the respected and beloved friend whose remains were yesterday conveyed to the tomb, is gone to partake. Her acquisitions and her virtues, the devotion of her time and faculties to the great purpose of her being; that constant and supreme veneration of God which pervaded her soul, that deep sense of responsibility to him, which led her to connect the motives and the actions of her life with the Solemnities of a future judgement and the retributions of eternity, while they raised her in the estimation of all who were favored with a knowledge of her Character must also have recommended her to him to whom she has given her account.Mrs Adams possessed a mind elevated in its views and capable of attainments above the common order of intellects. Her discernment was quick, her judgement solid and all her faculties so happily adjusted as to form at once the intelligent discrete and captivating mind. In the dispositions of Providence her lot was castt in a period of time and on a theatre of duties and events favorable to the development and exercise of her powers. Her Opportunities for improvement were not lost. An habitual intercourse with one of the most enlightened Characters at home, and in her travels abroad an Acquaintance with some of high rank and attainments in other Countries and a subsequent correspondence with them, united to a taste for reading and reflection had enriched her intellectual treasures and stored her mind with a fund of rare and useful knowledge. Her acquaintance with men and with events with the civil and political interests of her own country; from the sphere in which she was called to act was deep and extensive. Conversant with the circumstances that led to the dismemberment of this from the parent Country and partaking in the feelings of the leading Characters in the mighty struggle, she had early formed an attachment to the liberties of her Country which was strengthened by her connection and Sympathy and cooperation with the bereaved companion of her life in the exulted stations he has filled.But though her Attainments were great and she had moved in the highest walks of society and was fitted for the lofty departments in which she moved acted, her elevation had never filled her soul with pride or led her for a moment to forget the feelings and the claims of others. She was always the same meek and humble and obliging Christian; nor will one voice be heard, uncommon as it is, but in commendation of her worth.Her conversation was adapted to improve and endear those who were favored with the privilege of her acquaintance. She was easy of access communicative in her intercourse, and all who were admitted to her presence were both entertained and made happy.In her domestic Character—in the oversight and management of her family concerns, in her discretion and prudence, and in all the qualities that could contribute to the comfort and well being of her house hold She stood almost without a rival.Among the members of this Society who had long known her excellencies She was beloved and respected without a solitary  exceptionThe tidings of her illness were heard with grief in every house and her death is felt as a common loss. To the afflicted she had consolations to impart and to the destitute her charities were timely and unremitted. Multitudes in sickness and in want have been the subjects of her liberal distribution, and have occasion to rank her among the first of earthly benefactors. Often has she wiped the tears from the cheek of sorrow and carried relief and comfort to the mansions of cold and hunger and nakedness.Her deeds of kindness her sympathy in the sufferings of those who in the allotments of Providence were struggling with poverty are inscribed on the imperishable records of eternity, and will we doubt not be a source of happiness to her when the treasures of the unfeeling and the merciless are no more. In her religious faith and character she was among the deciples whom Jesus loved. Early initiated into the belief of the Christian doctrine its heavenly influences had dispensed a lustre over all the faculties of her Soul and formed her to the mild and humble to the amiable and engaging temper which all beheld and admired.Her faith in the Gospel was built on rational and Solid grounds. The conversation and the writings of Infidels which she had heard and read, were unable to shake the firmness of her hold on this system of light and comfort of purity and hope which the Christian revelation presents. In the religion of Jesus she saw the Character of God in all its holiness and perfection, in all its adorable and endearing excellencies. She viewed it as a system of benevolence and love, as designed to enlighten and purify the Soul of Man, to exalt his views and pursuits, and to train him up for a nobler existence, for an endless carrer of improvement and happiness.Having deeply imbibed the benevolent spirit of her Master she had nothing of the bigotry and exclusiveness of sects and parties, but could see the followers of Christ, the destined subjects of eternal Salvation, no less in this than in that denomination of Christians. In her estimation the creeds of erring Mortals were less than nothings and doctrines of no further importance than as they contributed to the growth of virtuous dispositions and the moral improvement of the Character. Her religion was the religion of the heart and the affections. It was that religion which we cannot but think will abide the trial of the last day and continue with the soul when the “hay and the stubble” the follies and destinctions of flaming partizans shall be consumed.But we are drawing to a scene where the christians faith and hope are felt in all their unutterable importance in all their sublime and consoling effects. The approaches of the last Evening were rapid but not overwhelming to her mind. A constitution which for thirty years has suffered the most violent attacks of disease without any long intermissions was unable with the strength of youth to sustain the final shock.Mrs Adams sank under the debilitating weight of her Malady; and that mind which had been so clear and vigorous was occasionally bewildered. Life for several days seemed to be suspended on a thread which the motion of a leaf might rend Asunder. But while reason was spared religion enlivened and supported her Soul. She expressed her perfect submission to Gods will and her readiness at his call to resign herself to his merciful disposal.Death came to her as the messenger of peace, to add another to the countless multitudes of pure and blessed and immortal spirits.Such are the outlines of a character whose worth is confessed by all w

her to connect the motives and  
the actions of her life with the

while they raised her in the esti-  
mation of all, who were favoured  
with a knowledge of her charac-  
ter, must also have recommended  
her to the approbation of [Zim to  
whom she has given her account.  
Madam Adams possessed a mind  
elevated in its views, and capable  
of attainments above the common  
order of intellects. Her discern-  
ment was quick, her judgment  
solid, and all her faculties so hap-

correspondence with them, united.  
with a taste for reading and re-  
flection, had enriched her intel-  
lectual treasures, and stored her  
mind with a fund of rare and uses  
ful knowledge. Her acquaintance  
with men and with events, with  
the civil and political interests of  
her own country was deep and  
extensive. Conversant with the  
circumstances, that led to the dis-  
memberment of this from the par-  
ent country, and partaking in the  
feelings of the leading characters  
in the mighty struggle, she had  
early formed an attachment to the  
liberties of her country, which was  
strengthened by her connection,  
and sympathy, and co-operation  
with the bereaved companion of  
her life in the exalted stations he  
has filled.  
  
But though her attainments  
were great, though she had moved  
in the higher walks of life, and  
was fitted for the lofty depart-  
ments, in which she acted, her ele-  
vation had never filled her soul

household she stood almost with-  
outa rival.  
  
Among the members of this so-  
ciety, W ho had long known her ex-  
cellencies, she was beloved and  
respected without a solitary ex-  
ception. ‘The tidings of her ill-  
ness were heard with grief in ev-  
ery house, and her death is felt as  
a conimon loss.  
  
To the afflicted she had conso-  
lations to nnpart, and to the des-  
titute her charities were timely  
and unremitted. Multitudes in

the sub) jects of her hi be } “ah distri-

and carried relief and comfert to  
the manstons of cold,and hunger,

kindness, her sympathy in the  
sufferings of those, who in the al-

be a source of happiness to her,  
when the treasures of the unfeel-

In her religious faith and char-

outa rival.  
  
Among the members of this so-  
ciety, who had long known her ex-  
cellencies, she was beloved and  
respected without a solitary ex-  
ception. ‘The tidings of her ill-  
ness were heard with grief in ev-  
ery house, and her death is felt as  
a conmon loss.  
  
To the afflicted she had conso-  
lations to impart, and to the des-  
titute her charities were timely  
and unremitted. Multitudes in  
sickness and in want have been  
the subjects of her liberal distri-  
butious, and have occasion to rank  
her among the first of earthly  
benefactors. Often has she wiped  
the tear from the cheek of sorrew,  
and carried relief and comfert to  
the mansions of cold, and hunger,  
and nakedness. Her deeds of  
kindness, her sympathy in the  
sufferings of those, who in the al-  
lotments of providence were strug-  
gling with poverty, are inscribed  
on the imperishable records of  
eternity ; and will, we doubt not,  
be a source of happiness to her,  
when the treasures of the unfeel-  
ine and the merciless are no more.  
  
n her religious faith and char-  
acter she was among the disci-  
les, whom Jesus loved. Early  
mitiated into the belief of the  
christian doctrine, its heavenly in-  
fluences had diffused a lustre over  
ali the faculties of her soul, and  
formed her to the mild and hum-  
ble, to the amiable and engaging  
temper, which all beheld and ad-  
mired. Her faith in the gospel  
was built on rational and solid  
unds. ‘The conversation and  
the writings of infidels, which she  
had heard and read, were unable  
to shake the firmness of her hold  
on that system of light and com-  
fort, of purity and hope, which the  
  
christian revelation presents. Thi  
the religion of Jesus, she saw the  
character of God in all its holi-  
ness and perfection, in alk itg  
adorabie and endearing excellen-  
cies. She viewed it as a system  
of benevolence and leve, as de-  
signed to enlighten and purify the  
soul of man, to exalt his views and  
pursuits, and to train him up fora  
nobler existence, for an endless  
career of improvement and hap-  
piness. Having deeply imbibed  
the benevolent spirit of her mas-  
ter she had nothing of the bigotry  
and exclusiveness of sects and  
parties ; but could see the follow-  
ers of Christ, the destined subjects  
of eternal salvation, no less in this  
than in that denomination of  
christians. - In her estimation the  
creeds of erring mortals were less  
than nothing, and doctrines ef no  
further importance than as they  
contributed to the growth of vir-  
tuous dispositions and the moral  
improvement of the character.  
Her religion was the religion of  
the heart and the affections. it  
was that religion, which we can-  
not but think will abide the trial  
of the last day, and continue with  
the soul, when the “hay and the  
stubble,” the follies and the dis&lt;  
tinctions of flaming partizans shall  
be consumed.  
  
But we are drawing to a scene,  
where the christian’s faith and  
hopes are felt in all their unutter-  
able importance, in all their sub-  
lime and consoling effects. ‘The  
approaches of the last enemy were  
rapid, but not overwhelmmg to  
her mind. A constitution, which  
for thirty years had suffered with-  
out any long intermissions the  
most violent attacks of disease,  
was unable to sustain with the  
strength of youth the final shock.
