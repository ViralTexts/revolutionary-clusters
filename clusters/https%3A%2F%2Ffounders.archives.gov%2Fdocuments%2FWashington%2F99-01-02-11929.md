I have not had the honor of a line from you, since the 4th of march last, but I will ascribe my disappointment to any cause, rather than to a decay of your friendship.  
Having the appearance, &amp; indeed the enjoyment of peace, without a final declaration of it; I, who am only waiting for the ceremonials, or ’till the British forces shall have taken leave of New York, am placed in an awkward and disagreeable situation, it  
being my axious desire to quit the walks of public life, &amp; under the shadow of my own vine, and my own Fig-tree, to seek those enjoyments, &amp; that relaxation, which a mind that has been constantly upon the stretch for more than eight years, stands so much in need  
of.  
I have fixed this epoch to the arrival of the Definitive Treaty—or to the evacuation of my country by our newly acquired friends. In the mean while at the request of Congress, I spend my time with them at this place, where they came in consequence of the  
riots at Philadelphia, of which you have doubtless (for it is not a very recent transaction) been fully apprised. They have lately determined to make choice of some convenient spot near the Falls of Delaware for the permanent residence of the sovereign power of these United  
States; but where they will hold their Sessions ’till they can be properly established at that place, is yet undecided.  
I have lately made a tour through the Lakes George &amp; Champlain as far as Crown point—then returning to Schenectady, I proceeded up the Mohawk river to Fort Schuyler (formerly Fort Stanwix), crossed over to the Wood Creek which empties into the Oneida  
Lake, &amp; affords the water communication with Ontario. I then traversed the Country to the head of the Eastern Branch of the Susquehanna &amp; viewed the Lake Otsego, &amp; the portage between that lake &amp; the Mohawk river at Canajohario—Prompted by these actual  
observations, I could not help taking a more contemplative &amp; extensive view of the vast inland navigation of these United States, fromMaps and the information of others; &amp; could not but be struck with the immense diffusion &amp; importance of it; &amp; with the  
goodness of that providence which has dealt her favors to us with so profuse a hand. Would to God we may have wisdom enough to improve them. I shall not rest contented ’till I have explored the Western Country, &amp; traversed those lines (or great part of them) which have  
given bounds to a New Empire. But when it may, if it ever shall happen, I dare not say, as my first attention must be given to the deranged situation of my private concerns which are not a little injured by almost nine years absence &amp; total disregard of them. With every

Princelon, Oct. 12, 17838.  
My Dear Cuevatier,  
  
I have not had the honour of a let-  
ter from you since the 4th of March  
last; but I will ascribe my disap-  
pointment to any cause sooner than  
to a decay of your friendship.  
  
Having the appearances, and, in-  
deed, the enjoyment of peace, with-  
  
&#x27; out the final declaration of it. 1, whe

am only waiting for the ceremonials,  
or till the British forces shall have ta-  
ken their leave of New-York, am  
held in an awkward and disagreea-  
ble situation, being anxiously de-  
sirous to quit the walks of public life,  
and under my own vine and my own  
fig-tree to seek those enjoyments.  
and that relaxation, which a mind  
that has been constantly upon the  
stretch for more than eight years,  
stands so much in want of.  
  
I have fixed this epoch to the ar-  
rival of the definitive treaty, or to the  
evacuation of my country, by our  
newly-acquired friends ; in the mean  
while, at the request of Congress, |  
spend my time with them at this  
place, where they came in conse-  
quence of the riots at Philadelphia,  
of which, doubtless, you have been  
informed, for it is not a very recent  
transaction.  
  
They have lately determined to  
fix the permanent residence of Con-  
gress near the falls of Delaware ; but  
where they will hold their sessions,  
till they can be properly established  
at that place, is yet undecided.  
  
I have lately made a tour through  
the Lakes George and Champlain as  
far as Crown Point—then returning  
to Schenectady, I proceeded up the  
Mohawk river to Fort Schuyler, (for-  
merly Fort Stanwix,) .crossed over  
Wood creek, which empties into the  
Oneida Lake, and affords the water  
communication with Lake Ontario ;  
I then traversed the country to the  
head of the eastern branch of the Sus-  
quehannah, and viewed the Lake  
Otsego, and the portage between that  
Lake, and the Mohawk river at  
Canajoharie.  
  
Prompted by these actual observa-  
tions, I could not help taking a more  
contemplative and extensive view of  
the vast inland navigation of these U.  
States, from maps, and the informa-  
tion of others, and could not but be  
struck with the immense diffusion and  
  
importance of it, and with the good-

PRINCETON, October 12, 1783.  
  
My Dear CHEVALIER: I have not  
  
had the honor of a letter from you  
  
since the 4th of March last, but |  
will ascribe my disappointment to  
any cause rather than to a decay of  
your friendship.  
  
Having the appearances, and in-  
deed the enjoyment of peace, without  
the final declaration of it, I, who am  
only waiting for the ceremonials, or  
till the British forces shall have taker  
their leave of New York, am held in an  
awkward and disagreeable situation ;  
being anxiously desirous to quit the  
walks of public life, and, under my  
own vine and my own fig-tree, to seek  
those enjoyments and that relaxation  
which a mind that has been constant-  
ly upon the stretch for more than  
eight years stands so much in want  
of.  
  
I have fixed this epoch to the arri-  
val of the definitive treaty, or to the  
evacuation of my country by our new-  
ly acquired friends. In the  
while, at the request of Congress, I  
spend my time with them at this  
place ; where they came in conse-  
quence of the riots at Philadelphia, of  
which, doubtless, you have been fully  
informed, for it is not a very recent  
transaction.  
  
They have lately determined to fix  
the permanent residence of Congress  
near the falls of Delaware, but where  
they will hold their session till they  
can be properly established at that  
place is yet undecided.  
  
I have lately made a tour through  
the Lakes George and Champlain as  
far as Crown Point; then, returning

it ever should, happen, I dare not  
say, as my first attention must be  
given to the deranged situation of  
my private concerns, which are not  
a little injured by almost nine years  
absence and total disregard of them.

sincere and affectionate regard, etc.,
