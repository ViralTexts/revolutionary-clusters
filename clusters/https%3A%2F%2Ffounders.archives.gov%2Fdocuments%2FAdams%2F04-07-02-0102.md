Pope says, “those best can bear reproof, who merit praise.” It is upon this principal that I would gaurd you against the only error that I am conscious you possess. I cannot advise you better upon this subject than in the words of Pope, and as you love poetry fix the following lines in your memory  
  
Tis not enough taste judgement Learning join;  
In all you speak, let Truth and candour shine  
That not alone, what to your sense is due.  
All may allow, but seek your Friendship too  
  
Be silent always when you doubt your Sense  
And speak; tho sure with Seeming diffidence  
Some possitive persisting Fops we know  
Who if once wrong will needs be always so.  
But you with pleasure own your Errors past  
And make each day a critic on the last.

I think (without an opportunity of direct

ten years since the citizens of Maryland  
have been petitioning and memorializing  
tlie Legislature. For nine or ten years I  
have been there personally. In 1807, I  
think, we obtained a special committee  
that made a strong report, hut nothing was  
done. It is a truism that that can never  
be politically right which is morally wrong,  
and yet the converse of it is the principle  
of action in all our entire licensing system.  
It is but a plain inference of common sense,  
that if gambling by lotteries or otherwise  
is wrong, licensing gambling is, in fact,  
licensing all the evils which result from it;  
and so with the selling of intoxicating  
liquors. If tlie evils which are attributable
