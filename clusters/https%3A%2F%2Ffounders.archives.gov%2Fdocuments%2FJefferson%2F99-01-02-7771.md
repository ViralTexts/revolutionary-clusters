s mes­  
sage, the majority contended that the  
publication of the French papers would  
be a breach of confidence towards the  
French court, as well as disrespectful to  
the Executive. But when the President  
left the question of publishing Cham­  
pagny’s letter to the decision of Con­  
fress, the breach of confidence towards  
&#x27;ranee was no longer an obstacle. An  
intimation from the Executive was more  
powerful, more convincing, than the  
most cogent arguments of an eloquent  
minority ; and the publication was una­  
nimously agreed to. .
