How long do you think it took to  
write the Bible? Fifteen hundred  
years. From Moses, who wrote  
Genesis, to St. John, who wrote  
Revelation, it was that long, long  
; hue.  
How maiiv people helpt&#x27;d to write  
it? More than thirty. There were  
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, I&#x27;aul  
and Peter. There were Moses aud  
K.ra, and David and Daniel, and  
Samuel. Some were shepherds,  
some farmers, some lishcrmeu, some  
tent makers, some kings, some  
judges, some princes; some were  
learned, some were unlearned; and  
vet they all agree in what they write.

said : &quot;Our next meeting must then be in  
the country to which they have flown, a  
country for us not very far distant. For  
this journey we shall &quot;need neither gold  
nor silver in our purse, nor scrip, nor  
coats, nor staves. Nor is the provision for  
it more easy than the preparation has been  
kiad. Nothing proves more than this  
that the Being who presides over the  
wor.d is essentially benevolent—stealing  
from us one by one the faculties, leading  
us liKe t e horse in his mill round and  
round the same beating circle,  
m . To gf « what we have seen,  
I o taste the tasted, and at each return  
Less tasteful ; o&#x27;er our palates to descant  
Another vintage—  
until, satiated and fatigued with this  
leaden iteration, we ask our conge.  
&quot;I heard once a very old friend, who had  
troubled himself with ueithei poets nor  
philosophers, say the same thing in prose,  
that he was tired of pulling off his shoes  
and stockings at night, and patting them  
on again in the morning. The wish to  
stay here is gradually extinguished ; but  
not so easy is that of returning once in a  
while to see how things have gone on.  
Perhaps, however, one of the elements of  
future felicity is to be a constant and un­  
i m passioned view of what is the wish of  
occasional visit. Mercier has given us a  
vision of the year 2440; but prophecy is  
one thing and history another. On the  
whole, however, perhaps it is wise and  
well to be contented with the good things  
which the Master of the feast places before  
us, and bt thankful for what we have  
rather than thoughtful about what we  
have not.&quot;
