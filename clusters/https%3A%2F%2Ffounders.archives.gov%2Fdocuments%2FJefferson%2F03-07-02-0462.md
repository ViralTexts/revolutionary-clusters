. 14.  
On the subject of the Academy or College proposed to be established in our neighborhood, I promised the trustees that I would prepare for them a plan, adapted in the first instance to our slender funds, but susceptible of being enlarged either by their own growth or by accession from other quarters. I have long entertained the hope that this our native state would take up the subject of education, and make an establishment, either with or without incorporation into that of William &amp; Mary, where every branch of science, deemed useful at this day, and in our country, should be taught in it’s highest degree. with this view I have lost no occasion of making myself acquainted with the organisation of the best seminaries in other countries, and with the opinions of the most enlightened individuals on the subject of the sciences worthy of a place in such an institution. in order to prepare what I had promised our trustees, I have lately revised these several plans with attention and I am struck with the diversity of arrangement observable in them, no two being alike. yet I have no doubt that these several arrangements have been the result of mature reflection, by wise and learned men, who, contemplating the local circumstances, have adapted them to the condition of the section of society for which they have been framed. I am strengthened in this conclusion by an  examination of each separately, and a conviction that no one of them, if adopted without change, would be suited to the circumstances and pursuits of our country. the example they have set then is authority for us to select from their different institutions the materials which are good for us, and with them to erect a structure whose arrangement shall correspond with our own social condition, and shall admit of enlargement in proportion to the encoragements it may merit and recieve. as I may not be able to attend the meetings of the trustees, I will make you the Depository of my ideas on the subject, which may be corrected as you proceed by the better views of others, and adapted from time to time to the prospects which open on us, and which cannot now be specifically foreseen and provided for.  
In the first place we must ascertain with precision the object of our institution, by taking a survey of the general field of science, and marking out the portion we mean  to occupy at first, and the ultimate extension of our views beyond that, should we be enabled to render it in the end as comprehensive as we would wish.  
  
  
I. Elementary Schools.  
It is highly interesting to our country, and it is the duty of it’s functionaries to provide, that every citizen in it should recieve an education proportioned to the condition and pursuits of his life. the mass of our citizens may be divided into two classes, the laboring, &amp; the learned. the laboring will need the first grade of education to qualify them for their pursuits and duties: the learned will need it as a foundation for further acquirements. a plan was formerly proposed to the legislature of this state for laying off every county into Hundreds or Wards of 5. or 6. miles square, within each of which should be a school for the education of the children of the ward, wherein they should recieve three years instruction gratis, in reading, writing, arithmetic as far as fractions, the roots and ratios, and Geography. the legislature, at one time, tried an ineffectual expedient for introducing this plan, which having failed it is hoped they will some day resume it in a more promising form.  
  
  
II. General Schools.  
At the discharge of the pupils from this elementary school, the two classes separate: those destined for labor will engage in the business of labor agriculture, or enter into apprenticeships to such handicraft art as may be their choice: their companions destined to the pursuits of science will proceed to the College, which will consist of 1st General schools and 2d Professional schools. College  for the  second the General schools will constitute the second grade of education. The learned class may still be subdivided into two sections. 1. those who are destined for learned professions as a means of livelihood; and 2. the Wealthy who possessing independant fortunes may aspire to share in conducting the affairs of the nation, or to live with usefulness &amp; respect in the private ranks of life. both of these sections will require instruction in all the higher branches of science, the wealthy to qualify them for either public or private life, the Professional section will need those branches especially which are the basis of their future profession, and a general knolege of the others as auxiliary to that, and necessary to their standing and associating with the scientific class. all the branches then of useful science ought to be taught in a College the General schools to a general competent extent, in the first instance. these sciences may be arranged into 3. departments, not rigorously scientific indeed but sufficiently so for our purpose. these are I. Language. II. Mathematics. III. Philosophy.  
  
  
1. Language.  
I. In the 1st department I would arrange as distinct sciences, 1. Languages and history, antient and modern. 2. Grammar. 3. Belles lettres. 4. Rhetoric and Oratory. 5. a school for the deaf, dumb and blind.history is here associated with languages not as a kindredscience subject, but on a principle of economy, because both may be attained by the same course of reading, if books are selected with that view.  
  
2. Mathematics.  
II. in the department of Mathematics I should place distinctly 1. Mathematics pure. 2. Physico-mathematics. 3. Physics. 4. Chemistry. 5. Natural history, to wit, Mineralogy. 6. botany. and 7. Zoology. 8. anatomy. 9. the Theory of Medecine.  
  
3. Philosophy.  
III. in the Philosophical department I should distinguish 1. Ideology. 2. Ethics. 3. the Law of Nature &amp; Nations. 4. Government. 5. Political economy.  
but some of these terms being used by different writers in different degrees of extension, it is necessary to define exactly what I mean to comprehend within each of them.  
I. 3. within the term of Belles lettres I include poetry &amp; composition generally, and Criticism.  
II. 1. I consider pure mathematics as the science of 1. Numbers. and 2. Measure in the abstract. that of numbers consisting of comprehending Arithmetic, Algebra, &amp; Fluxions; that of Measure, under the general term appellation of Geometry, comprehending Trigonometry plane and Spherical. Conic sections and Transcendental curves.  
II. 2. Physico-Mathematics treat of Physical subjects by the aid of Mathematical calculation. these are Mechanics, Statics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, hydro-dynamics, navigation, astronomy, geography, optics, pneumatics, Acoustics.  
II. 3. Physics, or Natural philosophy (not entering the limits of chemistry) treat of natural substances, their properties, mutual relations and action. they particularly examine the subjects of motion, attraction, magnetism, electricity, galvanism—light meteorology with an Etc not easily enumerated.these definitions and specifications render immaterial the question whether I use the generic terms in the exact degree of comprehension in which others use them. to be understood is all that is necessary to the present object.  
  
  
III. Professional Schools.  
At the close of this course the Students separate, the wealthy retiring with a sufficient stock of knolege to improve themselves to any degree to which their views may lead them, and the Professional section to Special the Professional Schools constituting the IIId Grade of education, and teaching the particular sciences which the individuals of this section mean to pursue with more minuteness and detail than was within the general scope of the General schools for the 2d grade of instruction. in these Special Professional schools each science is to be taught in the highest degree it has yet attained. they are to be in the  
Ist Department, the Fine arts, to wit, civil Architecture, Gardening Painting, Sculpture &amp; the theory of Music.in the  
IId Department, Architecture military and naval, Projectiles, Rural economy (comprehending agriculture, horticulture, and veterinary) Technical philosophy, the Practice of Medecine, Materia medica Pharmacy, and Surgery.in the  
IIId Department, Theology &amp; Ecclesiastical history, Law municipal and foreign.  
To these Special Professional schools will come those who separated at the close of their 1st Elementary course, to wit,  
the Lawyer to the school of Law.  
the Ecclesiastic to that of Theology &amp; Ecclesiastical history.  
the Physician to those of the Practice of medecine, Materia Medica, Pharmacy and Surgery  
the military man to that of military &amp; naval architecture &amp; Projectiles:  
the Agriculturer Agricultor to that of Rural economy:  
Cthe Gentleman, the Architect, Pleasure-gardener, Painter &amp; Musician to the school of Fine arts:  
and to that of Technical philosophy will come the mariner carpenter, ship-wright, plough-wright, wheel wright, mill wright, pump-maker, clock-maker, machinist, optician, metallurgist, founder, cutler, druggist, brewer, vintner, distiller, dyer, painter, bleacher, soap-maker, tanner, powder maker, salt maker, glass maker, to learn as much as shall be necessary, to pursue their art understandingly, of the sciences of geometry, mechanics, statics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, hydrodynamics, navigation, astronomy, geography, optics, pneumatics, acoustics, physics, chemistry, natural history, botany &amp; mineralogy &amp; pharmacy.  
The school of Technical philosophy will differ  essentially in it’s functions from the other Special Professional schools. the others are instituted to ramify and dilate the particular sciences taught in the schools of the 2d grade on a general scale only: the Technical school is to abridge those which were taught there too much in extenso for the limited wants of the artificer or practical man. these artificers must be grouped together, according to the particular branch of science in which they need elementary and practical instruction, and a special lecture or lectures must be prepared for each groupe. and these lectures should be given in the evening, so as not to interrupt the labors of the day. this school particularly should be maintained wholly at the public expence, on the same principle with that of the ward schools.  
A Tabular statement of this distribution of the sciences will place the system of instruction more distinctly in view. Through the whole of the Collegiate course, at the hours of recreation on certain days, all the Students should be taught the Manual exercise, Military evolutions and manoeuvres, should be under a standing organisation as a military corps, and with proper officers to train and command them.

On this survey of the field of science, I recur to the question, what portion of it do we mark out for the occupation of our Institution? with the 1st grade of education we shall have nothing to do. the sciences of the 2d grade are our first object, and to adapt them to our slender beginnings, we must separate them into groupes, comprehending many sciences each, and greatly more in the first instance than ought to be imposed  on, or can be competently conducted by, a single professor permanently. they must be subdivided from time to time, as our means increase, until each professor shall have no more under his care than he can attend to with advantage to his pupils, &amp; ease to himself. in the further advance of our resources the Special Professional schools must be introduced, and Professorships established for them also. for the present we may groupe the sciences into Professorships as follows, subject however to be changed according to the qualifications of the persons we may be able to engage.

The organisation of the branch of the Institution which respects it’s government, police, and economy depending on principles which have no affinity with those of it’s course of instruction, may be the subject of separate &amp; subsequent consideration.  
with this tribute of duty to the board of trustees, accept the assurance of my great esteem &amp; considerationTh: Jefferso

On the subject of the Academ v or  
College proposed to be established in&#x27;our  
neighborhood, I promised the trustees that  
I would prepare for them a plan, adopted  
in the first instance, to our slender tunds]  
but susceptible of being enl trg-d either by  
their own growth, or by accession from o­  
iber quarters. I have long entertained the  
hope that this our native state, would take  
up the subject of education, and make an  
establishment, either w&lt;th or without in­  
corporation, into that of William and Ma­  
ry. where even branch of science deem­  
ed useful at this day, should be taught in  
its highest degree. W;th this view, 1 have  
lost -&gt;n occasion of making myself acquain­  
tdwith ttv orgnmz tion of 1 he best semi­  
naries i;t other ourttries, and with theopi­  
nions o| the most enl ghtened individuals  
on the subject of the srietv es, worthy of a  
plaie in so h an institution. In order to  
prepare what T had promised nrrtrustee*,  
T &gt;avc l.it.dy revised these several plans  
with attention. a-*d I am struck with a.  
  
i diversity of a*-ra g m nt observable in  
them, no two being alike. Y&gt; t J have no  
doubt that these several arcing- nvmtshave  
been the subject of mature refl ation, by  
wise; and learned men, w&#x27;&gt;o, contemplating  
local ir-umst-nces, have adapted them to  
the condition of the section of society for  
which they have been framed. I&#x27; am  
strengthened in this conclusion bv an ex­  
amine, tion of each s piraMy, and a convic­  
tion tnat vj one of them, if adopted without  
change, would tie suited to the circum­  
stances and pursuits of our country. The  
example they have set, then, is authority  
for us to select from the r d fferent  
institutions the materials which are good  
Joru*, and with them to erect a structure,  
whose arrangement shall correspond with  
our own social rond.iion. and shall admit of  
enlargement in proportion to the encou­  
ragements it may merit and receive. As  
I may not be able to attend the me* tings  
of the trustees, 1 w 11 make you the fie  
pcsitory of my ideas on the subject, which  
may be rorrecied as you proceed, bv the  
better views of others, and - dapted, from  
time to time, to the prospects which open  
upon us, and which cannot now be specifi­  
cally seen and&#x27;provid&#x27;d for.  
In the first place, wc must ascertain with  
precision the object of our institution, by ^  
taking a survey of the general field of sci­  
ence, and marking nut the portion wc mean  
to occupy at first, and the ultimate exten­

it is the duty of its functionaries, to provide  
that every citisen in it should rerelve an

zens may bexlivided into two classes, the  
laboiing and the learned. The laboring  
will need the first grade of education to  
qualify them for tiieir pursuits and duties:  
the learned will need it as a foundation for  
further acquirements. A plan was for­  
merly proposed to the Legislature of this­  
Sta. • for laving off ev ry crhinty into Hun­

The school of Technical Philosophy,will  
differ essentially in its functions from the  
other Professional schools. The others  
are instituted to ramify and dilate the par­  
ticular sciences taught in the schools of the  
2d Grade on a general scale only. The  
Technical school is,to abridge those which  
were taught there too much in extenso for  
the limited wants of the artificer or prac­  
tical man. The«e artificers must l&gt;e group­  
ed together, according to the particular  
branch of k ience In wh ch they ne d ele­  
mentary and practical instruction, and a  
special lecture cr lectures should he pre­  
pared for each group—and these lectures  
should be given in the evening, so as-not to  
bit rrupt tne libers of the day. This school  
particularly should be maintained wholly  
r.t the public expftncc, on the same prin­  
ciples with that of the Ward schools. Thro&#x27;  
the whole of the Collegiate course, at the  
hours of recreation on certain days, all the  
Students should be taught the fnami.d ex­  
ercise, military evolutions and manoeuvres, j  
should he tinker a standing org mxation  
as a military corps, and with proper olli­  
cers to train and command them.

On this survey of the field of science, I  
recur to the question what portion of it do we  
mark out for the occupation of our Institu­  
tion ? With the 1st Grade of education,  
we shall have nothing to do. The sciences  
of tiie 2d Grade are our first object—ami  
to adapt tlu m to oar slender 1), gainings,  
we must separate them into groups, com­  
prehending many sciences each, ar.d great­  
ly more in toe first instance, than ought to  
be impost d on, or can be competently con­  
ducted by a sirgle professor permanently.  
They must be subdivided from time to  
time, as our means increase, until each  
professor shall have no more under his  
care than he can attend to with advantage  
to h.s pupils and ease to himself. In the  
further advance of our resources, the pro­  
fessional schools must be introduced and  
professorships established for them also.—  
tor thy.present, we may group the scien­  
ces into Professorships as follows—suhject,  
however, to be ch ngod according to the  
qualifications of the p rsons we may be a­

On the subject of llic Acsdemy or College pro­  
ponril to he established in our neighbourlicod, 1  
promised the trustee* that I would prepar.* for  
then* a plan, adapted, in the first instance, to our  
•lender funds,l&gt;ut susceptible of being enlarged ci.  
t»y their own growth, or by accession from other  
quarter*. I have long entertained the hope th.ik  
this our native state, would take up the subjec,  
of education, and make an cst*blithrnent, eidie.  
  
rtjtfx or without in :oT ■&#x27;ration, into that of V» il­  
iK&#x27;.o1 and Mery, where every branch of science  
uesmed useful etths day, should be taught in  
•u highest degree. With this view, 1 have lost  
no occasion of making myself acquaintetl with  
tne organisation of tlie best seminaries in other  
countr.es, unci with the opinions of the. most en­  
lightened individuals on tlte subject of the scien­  
ces, worthy of a place in such an institution. In  
oidtr to prepare wli.it 1 had promised our trustees*  
1 lia\e lately revised these several plans with at­  
tent ion, and 1 urn struck with the d.versity of ar­  
rangement observable in them, no tw&lt;» be.ng ar­  
tiks. Yet 1 have no doubt that these several ar­  
rangements have been the subject of mat ure re­  
flection, by wise and learned men, who content­  
ptal.ng local circuinstances, have adapted them  
to the condition of the section of society for  
which they have been framed. I am strengthen­  
ed in this conclusion by an examination of each  
separately, and a conviction that no one of them,  
ifadopted without change, would be suited totbe  
circumstances and pursuit of our country. Ts.e  
example tliey have set, then, is authority tor us to  
seL-ct from the.r different instituturns the roate­  
rniU which are good for us, &amp; with them to erect  
a sit ucture, whose arrangement shall correspond  
with our own social condition, and shall admit of  
enlargement in proportion to the encouragement  
it may merit and receive. As 1 may not’Se able  
to attend ihe meetings of the trustees, I wiU  
m-dee you the depoaitory of nty ideas on the sub­  
ject, wiiich may be cor ected as you proceed by  
tlte better view* of other*, and adapted, f om time  
to tune, to the projects which open upon us,  
end which cannot now be spectbcally seen and  
provided for.  
In the first place, we must ascertain with pre­  
cision the ob*ect ofour institution, ky taking a  
survey ol the general field of science, and mark­  
ing out the portion we mean to occupy at first,  
and the ultimate extension ofour views beyond  
that, should we be enabled to render it in * lie end,  
as comprehensive as We would wish.  
I. ELli M E NT A It Y SCHOOLS.  
It is highly interesting to our country, and it is  
the duty of iitt iuncti:,naries, to provide that eve­  
ry citizen in it should receive an education ptb­  
portioned to the condition &amp; pursuits of his life.  
I he mass ot our c.tizens may be divided into  
two classes, the laboring and the learned. The  
la.iuruig will need th«first grade of education to  
quality them for their pursuits and duties : the  
learned w*^ need it as a foundation for further ac­  
quirements. A plan Was formerly proposed to the  
Legislature of this state tor laving off’evey county  
into Hundreds or Wards of 5 or 6 miles squat e  
within each of which should be a school, for the  
education ofihe children of the ward, wherein  
they should receive three yea s instruction gratis,  
in reading, writing, arithmetic, as far as facti­  
ons, the roots and ratios, and geography. The  
Legislature at one time tr ed an ineffectual  
expedient for introducing this plan, winch hav­  
ing holed, it is hoped tliey wiUsomt. day resume  
it in a more promising form.  
  
n. GENERAL SCHOOLS.  
At the discharging of ti*e pupils from the ele­  
mentary schools, Uie two classes separa e .  
those destined tor labor will engage in me busi­  
ness ot agriculture, or enter into apprenticeships  
to suoli handicraft art as may be the.r choice ;  
their companions destined to the p irsuits of  
science, will proceed to the (Jottras, which  
will consist 1st. of tirxtnAii Schools, ,«nd 2d  
of PiionissioN-.tL Schools. TheUks«BAL Schools  
will continue (he 2d G aada ol education  
The learned class may still be subdivided into  
two sections: 1. Those who are destined for  
learned professions, as a means ofhveiihood; and  
2. 1 h« wealthy, who, possessing independent  
fortunes, may aspire to /share m conducting the  
ail airs ot the nation, or to live with usefulness &amp;.  
respect m the private rants of life, Bo.h of these  
sections will require instruction in all die Ingner  
branches ot science, the wealthy to quality them  
for either pubhc or private life; the professional  
section Will need those branches, especially,  
winch are the basis of their future professsicn,  
and a general knowledge of the others, as auxi­  
liary to that, and necessary o their stand.ng, and  
associating With the selenitic class. All the  
branches then of us-ful sc.ence ough&#x27; to be  
taught in the General Schools, to a competent ex­  
t&gt;. t, in the first instance. There sciences may  
i arranged iuto three departments, uot rigorous­

purpose. These are,  
1 Language. 11 Mathematic*. HI. P/ahtopkv.  
I. Laxguaoe. In lie first department, 1 won id  
arrange a distinct science, 1. Languages and his­  
tory, ancient and modern: 2. Grammar : 3. Helles  
Letters: 4 Hi,etoric and Oratory : 5. A school for  
the deaf, dumb &amp;, blind. History is here associ­  
ated with languages, not as a kindred subject, blit  
on a principle of economy, because both may to  
attained by the same course of reading, if bo oka  
ate selected with dial view. 6  
II. Matmxatjcs. In the department of Mu­  
thematics, 1 should place distinctly, I. Mathema­  
tics pure : 2. Physico mathematics : 3. Physics :  
4. Chemistry: 5 Natural History, to wit, Aline­  
ralogy : 6. Hotany: and 7. Zoology : 3. Anatomy i  
9. the i heory of .Medicine.  
III. Pmeosorur. In the Philosoph cal depart,

3. the Law of Nature and Nations : 4. Govcni­

must be grouped together, according to the  
particular branch of science in which they

prepared for each group—and these lec­

not to interrupt the labors of the day.—  
This school particularly should be main-&#x27;  
tained wholly at the public expense, on the

giate course, at the hours of recreation on  
certain days, all the Students should be

Dear Sir,—On the subject of the academy or col-  
lege proposed to be established in our neighborhood, |  
1 promised the trustees that I would prepare fo:  
them a plan, adapted, in the first instance, to our  
stender funds, but susceptible of being enlarged  
either by thcir own growth, or by accession from  
other quarters. I have long entertained tiie hope  
that this our native state, would tike up the sub-  
  
  
  
  
  
ject of education, and make an establishment,  
citer with or without incorporation, into that of  
  
|  
{  
  
citizen in it should receive an education proportion  
ed to the condition and pursuits of his life. The  
mass of our citizens may be divided into two class-  
es, the laboring and the learned. The laboring  
will need the first grade of education to qualify  
them for their pursuits and duties: the learned  
will need it as a foundation for further acquire-  
ments. &lt;A plan was formerly proposed to the le-  
gislature of this state for laying off every county  
into hundreds or wards of five or six miles square,  
within each of which should be a_ school, for the  
education of the children of the ward, wherein  
they should receive three years instruction gratis,  
in reading, writing and arithmetic, as far as frac-  
tions, the roots and ratios, and geography. The le-  
gislature atone time tried an ineffectual expedient  
for introducing this plan, which having failed, it is  
hoped they will some day resume it in a more pro-  
mising form.  
Il. GENERAL SCHOOLS.  
  
At the discharge of the pupils from the elemen-  
tary schools, the two classes separate; those des-  
tined for labor will engage in the business of agri-  
culture, or enter into apprenticeships to such han-  
dicrafi art as may be their choice; their compa-  
nions destined to the pursuits of science, will pro-  
ceed to the college, which will consist 1st. of gene-  
al schools, and 2d of professional schools. ‘The  
  
| general schools will constitute the 2d grade of edu-  
  
cation.  
The learned class may still be subdivided into

Dran Sirn,—On the subject of the academy or  
collere proposed to be established in our neigch-  
bourhood, | promised the trustees that TP would  
prepare for them a plan, adapted, in the first in-  
stance, to cur slender funds, but susceptible of  
being enlarged, either by their own growth, or  
by accession from other quarters. I have long  
entertained the hope that this, our native State,  
would take up the subjcet of education, and make  
an establishment, either with or without incorpo-  
ration, into that of William and Mary, whicre  
every branch of science deemed useful at this day,  
should be taught in its highest degree. With this  
view, I have lost no oceasion of making myself ac-  
quainted with the organization of the best semina-  
ries in other countries, and with the opinions of  
the most enlightened individuals on the subject of  
the sciences, worthy of a place in such an institu-  
tion. In order to prepare what 1 had promised  
our trustees, L have lately revised these several  
plans with attention, and J am struck with the di-  
versity of arrangement observable in them, no two  
being alike. Yet haveno doubt that these several  
arrangements have been the subject of mature  
reflection, by wise and learned men, who, con-  
templating local circumstances, have adapted  
them tothe condition of the section of socicty for  
“hich they have been framed. Lam strengthened  
tithis conclusion by an examination of cach sepa-  
rately, and a conviction thet no one of them, if  
adopted without change, would be suited to the  
circumstances and pursuits of our country. The  
example they have set, then, is authority for us  
toselect from their differcut institutions the mate-  
tials which are good for us, 2nd with them to erect  
4 structure, whose arrangement shall correspond  
with our own social condition, and shall admit of  
enlargement in proportion to the encouragements  
it may merit and receive. As } muy not be able  
‘o attend the meetings of the trustees, I will make  
you the depository of my ideas on the subject,  
which may be corrected as you proceed, by the  
better views of others, and adapted, from time to  
time, to the prospects which open upon us, and  
which cannot now be specifically seen and provi-  
ded for.  
  
_ In the firsf place, we must ascertain with preci-  
sion the object of our institution, by taking a sur-  
vey of the general field of science, and making out  
tic portion we mean to occupy at first, ‘and the  
ultimate attention of our views beyond that, should  
  
  
  
we be enabled to render it in the end as compre-  
hensive as we would wish.  
I. ELEMENTARY SCHOOTS. °  
  
It is highly interesting to our country, and. it is  
the duty of its functionaries, to provide that every  
citizen in it should receive an education propor-  
tioned to the condition and pursuits of his life.  
The mass of our citizens may be divided into twe  
classes, the laboring and the learned. The labor-  
ing will need the first grade of education to qua-  
lify them for their pursuits and duties; the learn-  
ed will need it as a foundation for further ac-  
quirements. A plan was formerly proposed to  
the legislature of this State, for laying ‘off every  
county into hundreds or wards of 5 or 6 miles  
square, within each of which should be a school,  
for the education of the children of the ward,  
wherein they should receive three years instrue-  
tion gratis, in reading, writing, arithmetic as far  
as fractions, the roots and rations; and geogta-  
phy. ‘The legislature at one time tried an ineflec-  
tual expedient for inwoducing this plan, which  
having failed, it is hoped they will. some day re-  
sume it ina more promising term.  
  
Il. GENERAL SCHOOLS,  
  
Atthe discharge of the pupils from theelemen-  
tary schools, the two classes separate; those des-  
tined for labor will engage in the business of agri-  
culture, or enter into apprenticeships to such  
handicraft art os may be their choice; their com-  
panions destined to the pursuits of science, will  
proceed to the cottzcr, Which will consist, Ist, of  
GrnenatSchools, and 2d, of Proressionay Schools.  
The Genxrnan Schools will constitute the 2d crap»  
of education.  
  
The learned class may still be subdivided into  
two sections: 1. ‘Those who are destined for learn-  
ed professions, as a means of liveliiood; and 2,  
The wealthy who, possessing independent for-  
tunes, may aspire to share in conducting the af-  
fairs of the nation, or to live with usefulness and  
respect in the private ranks of live. Both of these  
sections will require instruction in all the higher  
branches of scicnee, the wealthy to qualify thei  
for cither public or private life; the professional  
section will need these branches, especially, which  
are the basis oftheir future profession, and a ge-  
neral knowledze of the others, asauxiliary to that,  
and necessary to their standing, and associating  
with the scientific class. All the branches then  
of useful science ought to be taught in the Genc-  
ral Schools, to a competent extent, in the first in-  
stance. These sciences may be arranged into  
three departments, not rigorously scientific in-  
deed, but sufficiently so for our purpose. ‘These  
are,  
  
I. Lanruage. 11. Mathematics. 11. Philosophy. ,  
  
I. Lancuace. In the first department, I would  
arrange, xs distinct sciences, 1. Languages &amp; His-  
tory, ancient and modern: 2. Grammar: 3. Belles  
Lettres: 4. Rhetoric and Oratory: 5. A schoat  
for the deaf, dumb and blind. History is here as-  
sociated with Languages, not as a kindred subject,  
but on a principle of economy, because both may  
be attained by the same course of reading, 3f  
books are selected with that view.  
  
  
  
Ii. Matuematics. In the department of Mathe-  
matics, I should place distinctly, 1. Mathematics  
pure: 2. Physico-Mathematics: 5. Physics: 4  
Chemistry : 5. Natural History, to wit, Mincrato-  
gy: 6. Botany: and7. Zoology: 8. Anatomy: 2  
the Theory of Medicine.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
234  
  
tI. Purrosoray. {n the Philosophical depart-  
ment, Ishould distinguish, 1. Ideology : 2. Ethics:  
  
3. the law of Nature and Nations : 4. Government:  
  
5. Political Economy. But, some of these terms  
  
being used by different writers, in different de-  
  
grees of extention, I will define exactly what I  
  
mean to comprehend in each of them.  
  
I. S. Within the term of Belles Lettres, I in-  
clude Poetry and Composition generally, and Cri-  
ticism. ;  
  
It. 1. I consider’ Pure Mathematics as the sci-  
ence of 1. Numbers, and 2. Measure in the ab-  
stract: that of Numbers compehending Arithme-  
tic, Algebra and Fluxions; that of Measure, (un-  
der the general appellation of Geometry,) com-  
prehending Trigonomciry, plane and spherical,  
Conic sections, and transcendental curves.  
  
I. 2. Puysico Mariemarics treat of Physical  
subjects by the aid of Mathematical calculation.  
These-are Mechanics, Statistics, Hydrostatics, Hy-  
draulics, Hydrodynamics, Navigation, Astronomy,  
Geography, Optics, Pneumatics, Acoustics.  
  
H. 3. Pursics on Natura Puirosoruy, [not  
entering the limits of Chemistry,} treat of natural  
substances, their properties mutualrelutions, and  
action. They particularly examine the subjects  
of motion, attraction, magnetism, electricity, gal-  
vanism, light, meteorology, with an &amp;e. not easily  
enumerated. ‘These definitions and specitications  
render immaterial the question whether L use the  
generic terms in the exact degree of comprchen-  
sion in which others use them; to be understood is  
all thatis necessary to the present object.  
  
III. PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS.  
  
At the close of this course, the Students sepa-  
rate, the wealthy retiring, with a suflicicnt stock  
of knowledge, to improve themsclves to any de-  
gree to which their views may lead them, and the  
professional section to the Prorssroxat schools,  
constituting the Iff cnavz of education, and teach-  
ing the particular sciences which the individuals  
of this section mean to pursue, with more minute-  
ness and detail than was within the scope of the  
general school forthe 2d grade of instruction. In  
these Proressronat, schools, each science is io be  
taught in the highest degree it has yet attained.  
They are to be in the  
  
Ist. Department, the Fine arts, to wit. Civil  
Architecture, Gardening, Painting, Sculpture, and  
the theory of Music. In the  
  
2d. Depurtment, Architecture, Military and Na-  
val Projectiles, Rural Economy [comprehending  
Agriculture, Horticulture, and Veterinary.] ‘Tech-  
nical Philosophy,the practice of Medicine, Materia  
Medica, Pharmacy and Surgery. In the  
  
3d. Department, Vheology and Ecclesiastical  
History, Law, Municipal and Foreign.  
  
To these professional schools will come those  
who separated at the close of their lst Elementary  
course, to wit:  
  
‘The Lawyer to the school of law.  
  
The Ecclesiastic to that of Theology and Eccle-  
  
siastical History.  
  
‘The Physician to those of the practice of Medi-  
  
cine, Materia Medica, Pharmacy and Surge-  
  
ry.  
  
The Military man to that of Military and Naval  
Architecture and Projectiles.  
  
The Agricultor to that of Rural Economy.  
  
The Gentleman, the Architect, the Pleasure  
Gardener, the Painter and Musician, to the  
  
THE NATIONAL REGISTER.  
  
  
  
| No. 15,  
  
And to that of Technical Philosophy will come  
the mariner, carpenter, ship-wright, plough.  
wright, wheel wright, mill wright, pump maker,  
clock-maker, machinist, optician, metallurgist,  
founder, cutler, druggist, brewer, vintner, distil.  
ler, dyer, painter, bleacher, soap-maker, tanner,  
powder-maker, salt-maker, glass maker, to learn  
as much as shall be necessary to pursue their art  
understandingly, of the sciences of geometry, me-  
chanics, statistics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, hydro.  
dynamics, navigation, astronomy, geography, op-  
tics, pneumatics, accoustics, physics, chemistry,  
natural history, botany, mineralogy, and pharmacy,  
  
The school of Technical Philosophy will differ  
essentially in its functions from the other profes.  
sional schools. ‘The others are instituted to ramify  
and dilate the particular sciences taught in the  
schools of the 2d grade on a general scale only.  
The Technical school is to abridge those which  
were taught there too much in ixtenso for the 4i-  
mited wants of the artificer or practical man. These  
urtificers must be grouped together, according  
to the particular branch of science in which they  
need elementary and practical instruction, and a  
special Iccture or lectures should be prepared for  
exch group—and these lectures should be given  
inthe evening, so as not to interrupt the labors of  
the day. Viiis school particularly should be main-  
tained wholly at the public expense, on the same  
principles with that of the ward schools. ‘Through  
the whole of the Collegiate course, at the hours  
of recreation on certsin days, all the students  
should be taught the manuel exercise, military  
evolutions and mancwuvres, should be under a  
standing organization as a military corps and with  
proper officers to train and command them.  
  
A tabular statement of this distribution of the  
sciences wall place the system of instruction more  
particularly in view :  
1. Or Elementary Grade in the Ward Schools,  
Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Geography.  
Il. Or General Grade.  
1. Language and History, ancient and modern.  
2, Mathematics, viz.

Physico-Mathematics.  
  
Physics.  
  
Chemistry.  
Anatomy.  
  
Theory of Medicine,  
Zoology.

for the occupation of our institution ? With the  
first grade of education we shall have nothing to  
do. The sciences of the second grade are our  
first object; and to adapt them to our slender bé-  
ginning, we must separate them into groups, com-  
prehending many sciences each, and greatly more  
in the first instance, than ought to be imposed on,  
or can be competently conducted by asingle pro-  
fessor permanently. They must be subdivided  
from time to time, as our means increase, until  
each professor shall have no more under his care  
than he can attend to with advantage to his pu-  
pils and ease to himself. In the further advance  
of our resources, the professional schools must be  
introduced and professorships established for them  
also.—For the present, we may group the sciences  
into professorships, as follows—subject, however,  
to be changed according to the qualifications of  
the persons we may be able to engage.  
  
1—Professorship—Language and History, (an-  
cient and modern,) Belles Lettres, Rhetoric and  
Oratory.  
  
Il.—Professorship—Mathematics pure, Physico-  
Mathematics, Physics, Anatomy, Medicine, Theo-  
  
ry.  
  
Ill.—Professorship—Chemistry, Zoology, Bota-  
ny, Mineralogy.  
  
IV.—Professorship—Philosophy.  
  
Theorganization of the branch of the Institution  
which respects its government, police, and econo-  
my, depending on principles which have no affi-  
nity with those of its instruction, may be the sub-  
ect of separate and subsequent consideration.  
ge lye epee pee,  
  
With this tribute of duty to the Board of Trus-  
tees, accept the assurance of my great esteem and  
consideration.

N the subject of the aceeey hed  
colle roposed to be establis  
  
in our idiebbodtheo!, I promised the  
  
  
  
  
  
trustees that I would prepare for them  
a plan, adapted, in the first instance,  
to our slender funds, but susceptible of  
being enlarged either by their own  
growth, or by accession from  
  
quarters. 1 have long entertained the  
hope that this our native state would  
take up the subject of education, and  
make an establishment, either with or  
without incorporation into that of  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
648 Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s Plan of a College for Virginia.  
  
William and Mary, where every  
branch of the science deemed useful at  
this day, should be taught in its highest  
degree. With this view, | have lost  
no occasion of making myself ac-  
quainted with the organization of the  
best seminaries in other countries, and  
with the opinions of the most en-  
lightened individuals ou the subject  
of the sciences, worthy of a place in  
such an institution. In order to pre-  
  
re what | had promised our trustees,  
  
have lately revised those several  
plans with attention, and | am struck  
with the diversity of arrangement ob-  
servable in them, no two being alike.  
Yet L have no doubt that these several  
arrangements have been the subject of  
mature reflection, by wise and learned  
men, Who, contemplating local cir-  
cumstances, have adapted them to the  
condition of the section of the society  
for which they have been framed. |  
am strengthened in this conclusion, by  
an examination of each separately, and  
a conviction that no one of them, if  
adopted without change, would be  
suited to the circumstances and pursuits  
of our country. The example they  
have set, then, is authority for us to  
select from their different institutions  
the materials which are good for us,  
and with them to erect a structure,  
whose arrangement shall correspond  
with our own social condition, and  
shall admit of enlargement in pro-  
portion to the encouragement it may  
merit and receive. As I may not be  
able to attend the meetings of the  
trustees, | will make you the depo-  
sitary of my ideas onthe subject, which  
may be corrected as you proceed, by  
the better views of others, and adapted  
from time to time, to the prospects  
which open upon us, and which cannot  
= be specifically seen and provided  
or.  
  
In the first place we must ascertain  
with precision the object of our insti-  
tution, by taking a survey of the  
general field of science, and marking  
out the yoonpe we mean to occupy at  
first, and the ultimate extension of our  
views. beyond that, should we be  
enabled to render it in the end, as  
comprehensive as we could wish.  
  
_ TL. Elementary Schools.  
  
It is highly interesting to our coun-  
try, and it is the duty of its func-  
tonaries, to provide that every citizen  
im it should receive an education  
  
proportioned to the condition and  
pursuits of his life. The mass of our  
citizens may be divided into two  
classes, the labouring and the learned.  
The labouring will need the first  
grade of education to qualify them for  
their pursuits and duties: the learned  
will need it as a foundation for further  
acquirements. A plan was formerly  
proposed to the legislature of this  
state for laying off every county into  
hundreds or wards of five or six miles’  
square, within each of which should  
be a school, for the education of the  
children of the ward, wherein they  
should receive three years’ instruction  
gratis, in reading, writing and arith-  
metic, as far as fractions, the roots and  
ratios, and geography. The legislature  
at one time tried an ineffectual expe-  
dient for introducing this plan, which  
having failed, it is hoped they will  
some day resume it in a more promising  
form.  
If. General Schools.  
  
At the discharge of the pupils from  
the elementary schools, the two classes  
separate ; those destined for labour  
will engage in the business of agn-  
culture, or enter into apprenticeships  
to such handicraft arts as may be their  
choice; their companions destined to  
the pursuits of science, will proceed to  
the college, which will consist Ist of  
general schools, and 2nd. of professional  
schools. The general schools will  
constitute the second grade of edu-  
cation.  
  
The learned class may still be sub-  
divided iuto two sections: 1. those  
who are destined for learned profes-  
sions as a means of livelihood: an  
the wealthy, who, possessiig . 4  
pendent fortunes, may aspire to ain  
in conducting the affairs of the na  
or to live with usefulness and r of  
in the private ranks of life. I ioe  
these sections will require preer&quot;  
in all the higher brauches of science,  
the wealthy to qualify them for  
public or private life; the pe  
section will need those ran  
  
: ‘« of theif  
“ally ‘h are the basis ©  
especially, which cneral know  
  
ion, and a get  
  
lelnn cr the oteor as auxiliary tot  
and necessary to their roe  
associating with the —. .  
All the branches then of , science  
ought to be taught io &#x27; a  
schools, to a competent ane .  
first instance. These science  
  
  
  
ao Seo me ee ho  
  
  
  
  
  
  
arranged into three departments, not  
rigorously scientific indeed, but suffi-  
ciently so for our purpose. ‘These are,  
  
I. Language. Il. Mathematics.  
  
Ll. Philosophy.  
  
I. Language. ln the first department  
I would arrange as distinct sciences,  
1. languages and history, ancient and  
modern: &amp;. grammar: 3. belles ict-  
tres: 4. rhetoric and oratory: 5. a  
school for the deaf, dumb and blind.  
History is here associated with lan-  
guages, not asa kindred subject, but  
on a principle of economy, because  
both may be attained by the same  
course of reading, if books are selected  
with that view.  
  
Il. Mathematics. In the depart-  
meut of mathematics, | should place  
distinctly , 1. mathematics pure: 2.  
physico- mathematics: 3. physics: 4.  
chemistry : 5. natural history, to wit,  
  
mineralogy : 6. botany: and 7. Zo-  
ology : §. anatomy: 9. the theory of  
medicine.  
  
Ill. Philosophy. In the philosophical  
department, | should distinguish, 1.  
ideology: 2. ethics: 3. the law of  
nature and nations: 4, government :  
5. political economy.  
  
But some of these terms being used  
by differeut writers, in different degrees  
of extension, | will define exactly what  
I mean to comprehend in each of  
them.  
  
l. 3. Within the term of belles let-  
tres, Linclude poetry and composition  
generally, and criticism.  
  
Il. 1. Ll consider pure mathematics  
as the science of 1. numbers, and @,  
measure in the abstract: that of num-  
bers comprehending arithmetic, al-  
gebra, and fluxions: that of measure,  
(under the general appellation of geo-  
metry,) comprehending trigonometry,  
plane and spherical, conic sections,  
and transcendental curves.  
  
Il. 2. Physico-mathematics treat of  
physical subjects by the aid of mathe-  
matical calculation. ‘These are me-  
chanics, statics, hydrostatics, hy-  
draulics, hydrodynamics, navigation,  
astronomy, geography, optics, pneu-  
matics, and acoustics.  
  
Il. 3. Physics or natural philosophy,  
(not entering the limits of chemistry, )  
treat of natural substances, their pro-  
  
ies, mutual relations, and action.  
  
y particularly examine the subjects  
of motion, attraction, magnetism, elec-  
tricity, galvanisw, light, meteorolog

with an &amp;c. not easily enumerated.  
These definitions and specifications  
render immaterial the question whether  
l use the generic terms in the exact  
degree of comprehension in’ which  
others use them: to be understood is  
all thet is necessary to the present  
object.  
Ill. Professional Schools.  
  
At the close of this course, the  
students separate, the wealthy retiring  
with a suilicient stock of know ledge,  
tu improve themselves to any degree  
to which their views may lead them,  
and the professional section to the  
professt mal schools, constituting the  
Sd grade of education, and tea hing  
the particular sciences which the  
individuals of this section mean to  
pursue, with more minuteness and  
detail than was within the scope of  
the general schools for the second  
grade of instruction. In these pro-  
fessional schools, each science is to be  
taught in the highest degree it has yet  
attained: ‘They areto bein the —  
  
Ist Department, the fine arts, to wit,  
civil architecture, gardening, painting,  
sculpture and the theory of music.  
In the  
  
2d Department, architecture, mili-  
tary and naval projectiles, rural eco-  
nomy, (comprehending agriculture,  
horticulture and veterinary, ) technical  
philosophy, the practice of medicine,  
materia medica, pharmacy and sur-  
gery. In the  
  
Sd Department, theology and eecle-  
siastical history, law, municipal and  
foreign.  
  
To these professional schools will  
come those who separated at the close  
of their Ist elementary course, to wit:  
  
‘The lawyer to the school of law.  
  
The ecclesiastic to that of theology  
and ecclesiastical history.  
  
The physician to those of the prac-  
tice of medicine, materia medica,  
pharinacy and surgery,  
  
The military man to that of military  
and naval architecture and projectiles.  
  
Che agricultor to that of rural eoo-  
nomy.  
  
The gentleman, the architect, the  
pleasure gardener, painter ard musi-  
cian, to the school of fine arts.  
  
And to that of technical philosophy  
will come the mariner, carpenter,  
ship-wright, plough-wright, wheel-  
wright, mill-wright, pump-maker,  
clock-maker, machinist, optician,

The school of technical philosophy  
will differ essentially in its functions  
from the other professional schools.  
The others are instituted to ramify  
and dilate the particular sciences  
taught in the 2d grade on a general  
scale only. ‘The technical school is  
to abridge those which were taught  
there too much in extenso for the  
limited wants of the artificer or practi-  
cal man. ‘These artificers must be  
grouped together, according to the  
particular branch of science in which  
they need elementary and _ practical  
instruction, and a special lecture, or  
lectures, should be prepared for each  
group—and these lectures should be  
given in the evening, so as not to in-  
terrupt the labours of the day. This  
school, particularly, should be main-  
tained wholly at the public expense,  
on the same principles with that of  
the ward schools. Through the  
whole of the collegiate course, at the  
hours of recreation on certain days,  
all the students should be taught the  
manual exercise, military evolutions,  
and manceuvres; should be under a  
standing organization as a military  
corps, and with proper officers to  
train and command them.  
  
A tabuler statement of this distri-

On this survey of the field of science,  
I recur to the question, what portion  
of it do we mark out for the occupation  
of our institution? With the first  
grade of education we shall have no-  
thing to do.—The sciences of the 2nd,  
grade are our first object—and to  
adapt them to our slender beginnings,  
we must separate them into groups,  
comprehending many sciences each,  
and greatly more in the first instance,  
than ought to be imposed on, or can  
be competently conducted by a single  
professor permanently. They must  
be subdivided from time to time, %  
our means increase, until each pre  
fessor shall have no more under  
care than he can attend to with #d-  
vantage to his pupils and —  
himself. In the further advance  
our resources, the professional schools  
must be introduced, and professorships  
established for them also. For the  
present, we may group the sciences  
into professorships as follows—subjecs  
however, to be changed according ©  
the qualifications of the persons  
may be able to engage.  
i. Professorship. Language ae  
history (ancient _ ery  
lettres, rhetoric and oratory.

pending on principles which have no  
affinity with those of its instructions,  
may be the subject of separate and  
subsequent considerations.  
  
With this tribute of duty to the  
board of trustees, accept the assurance  
of my great estecm and consideration.  
  
TH. JEFFERSON

useful at this day should be taught in its highest degree.’*  
For this he was content to wait, knowing that it could be  
reached, if reached at all, only as one of the ” long results of  
time ”; but when he closed his eyes upon the prospect it was  
a fair one.

ency but in the grammar schools he hoped that the tuitions of the  
rich students would keep up the school without state aid.  
  
Another reform which Jefferson inaugurated was the identifica¬  
tion of the university idea with the existence of professional  
schools. In a letter to Peter Carr, Sept. 7, 1814, he advocated  
the establishment of professional schools “ in which each science  
is to be taught in the highest degree it has yet attained.” “ To  
these professional schools will come,” he says, “ the lawyer, . . .
