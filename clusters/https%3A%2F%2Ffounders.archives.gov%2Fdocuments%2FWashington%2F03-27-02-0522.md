merican Troops. If possible there should be this force kept up and supplied in any case while the enemy remain there with their present strength.  
					If any thing more can be done to stimulate the States this way to a compliance with the requisitions made of them, particularly in the Articles of flour and forage where we seem most defective, it will conduce more than any thing else to enabling us to act both here and to the Southward—for as I before observed, it appears to me evident that the means for a Southern operation, as well with respect to Supplies as men, must be principally carried from hence.  
					But while we are meditating offensive operations which may either not be undertaken at all, or being undertaken, may fail—I am perswaded Congress are not inattentive to the present State of the Army, and will view in the same light with me the necessity of providing in time against a period—the first of January—when one half of our present force will dissolve. The shadow of an Army that will remain will have every motive except mere patriotizm to abandon the Service—without the hope which has hitherto supported them of a change for the better: This is almost extinguished now, and certainly will not outlive the Campaign unless it finds something more substantial to rest upon. This is a truth of which every spectator of the distresses of the Army cannot help being convinced. Those at a distance may speculate differently; but on the spot an opinion to the contrary, judging of human nature on the usual scale would be chimerical. The honorable the Committee who have seen and heard for themselves will add their testimony to mine; and the wisdom and justice of Congress cannot fail to give it the most serious attention. To me it will appear miraculous if our affairs can maintain themselves much longer in their present train. If either the temper or the resources of the Country will not admit of an alteration, we may expect soon to be reduced to the humilitating condition of seeing the cause of America, in America, upheld by foreign arms. The generosity of our Allies has a claim to all our confidence and all our gratitude—but it is neither for the honor of America nor for the interest of the common cause to leave the work entirely to th

		To one who has been witness to the evils brought upon us by short enlistments, the system appears to have been pernicious beyond description, and a croud of motives present themselves to dictate a change. It may easily be shewn that all the misfortunes we have met with in the Military line are to be attributed to this cause. Had we formed a permanent Army in the beginning, which by the continuance of the same Men in Service, had been capable of discipline we never should have had to retreat with a handful of Men across the Delaware in Seventy Six—trembling for the fate of America, which nothing but the infatuation of the enemy could have saved. We should not have remained all the succeeding Winter at their mercy with sometimes scarcely a sufficient body of Men to mount the ordinary Guards, liable at every Moment to be dissipated, if they had only thought proper to March against us—We should not have been under the necessity of fighting at Brandywine with an unequal number of raw Troops, and afterwards of seeing Philadelphia fall a prey to a victorious Army—We should not have been at Valley forge with less than half the force of the enemy—destitute of every thing, in a situation neither to resist nor to retire—We should not have seen New York left with a handful of Men, yet an overmatch for the Main Army of these States, while the principal part of their force was detached for the reduction of two of them—We should not have found ourselves this Spring so weak as to be insulted by five thousand Men, unable to protect our baggage and Magazines, their security depending on a good countenance and a want of enterprize in the enemy—We should not have been the greatest part of the War inferior to the enemy, indebted for our safety to their inactivity, enduring frequently the mortificaton of seeing inviting oppertunities to ruin them,  
  
pass unimproved for want of a force which the Country was completely able to afford—To see the Country ravaged—our Towns burnt—The Inhabitants plundered—abused—murdered with impunity, from the same cause.

ce for all. Indeed it is probable the bounties may not be much greater in that case than they have been. The people of the States near the Seat of War ought to enter into such a plan with alacrity as it would ease them in a variety of respects—among others by obviating the frequent calls upon the Militia.  
					I cannot forbear returning in this place to the necessity of a more ample &amp; equal provision for the Army. The discontents on this head have been gradually matured to a dangerous extremety. There are many symptoms that alarm and distress me. Endeavours are using to unite both officers and Men in a general refusal of the money—and some Corps now actually decline receiving it. Every method has been taken to counteract it—because such a combination in the Army would be a severe blow to our declining currency. The most moderate insist that the accounts of depreciation ought to be liquidated at stated periods &amp; certificates given by Government for the Sums due. They will not be satisfied with a general declaration that it shall be made good.  
					This is one instance of complaint; there are others equally serious—among the most serious is the inequality of the provision made by the several States. Pensylvania maintains her Officers in a decent manner. She has given them half pay for life. What a wide difference between their situation and that of the Officers of every other line in this Army? some of whom are actually so destitute of Cloathing as to be unfit for duty, and obliged for that cause only to confine themselves to Quarters—I have often said, and I beg leave to repeat it, the half pay provision is, in my opinion, the most politic and effectual that can be adopted. On the whole, if something satisfactory be not done, the Army (already so much reduced in officers by daily resignations as not to have a sufficiency to do the common duties of it) must either cease to exist at the end of the Campaign, or it will exhibit an example of more virtue—fortitude—self denial—and perseverance than has perhaps ever yet been parallelled in the history of human enthusiasm.  
					The dissolution of the Army is an event that cannot be regarded with indifference—It would bring accumulated distresses upon us—It wd  
  
throw the people of america into a general consternation—It would discredit our cause throughout the World—It would shock our Allies—To think of replacing the Officers with others is visionary—the loss of the veteran Soldiers could not be repaired—To attempt to carry on the War with Militia against disciplined Troops would be to attempt what the common Sense and common experience of Mankind will pronounce to be impracticable. But I should fail in respect to Congress to dwell on observations of this kind in a letter to them.

treat, with a handful of men, across the Delaware,  
in 1776, trembling for the fate of America, which  
nothing but the infatuation of the enemy could  
have saved; we should not have remained all the  
succeeding winter at their mercy, with sometimes  
scarcely a sufficient number of men to mount the  
ordinary guards, liable at every moment to be dis-  
sipated if they had only thought proper to march  
against us, (1777 ;) we should not have been under  
the necessity of fighting at Brandywine, with an  
unequal number of raw troops, and afterwards of  
seeing Philadelphia fall a prey to a victorious  
enemy ; we should not have been at Valley Forge  
with less than half the force of the enemy, desti-  
tute of everything, in a situation neither to resist  
nor to retire (1778;) we should not have seen  
New York left with a handful of men, yet an  
overmatch for the main army of these States  
(1779 ;) we should not have found ourselves this  
spring (1780) so weak as to be insulted by 5000  
men, unable to protect our baggage and magazines  
—our security depending on a want of enterprise  
in the enemy, we should not have been, during a  
greater part of the war, indebted for our safety to  
their inactivity.’&quot;&quot;** This was no ebullition of tem-  
porary disappointment. Washington’s contempo-  
rary letters paint, in still darker colors, the dangers  
to which he was exposed through the weakness of  
congress, and the misconduct of the states.
