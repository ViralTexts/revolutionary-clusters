J. Adams Enclosure  
  
  
Dear Sir  
Febry. 20. 1797  
  
I thank you for giving me, the perusal of the inclosed.—The Sentiments do honour to the head and heart of the Writer; and if my Wishes would be of any avail, they should go to you with a strong hope, that you will not withold merited Promotion from Mr. J. Q. Adams, because he is your Son: for without intending to compliment, the father or the mother, or to censure any others, I give it as my decided opinion, that Mr. Adams, is the most valuable public Character We have abroad, and there remains no doubt in my mind that he will prove himself to be the ablest of all our diplomatic Corps. If he was now to be brought into that line, or into any other publick Walk, I could not, upon the principle, which has regulated my own conduct, disapprove of the caution, which is hinted at, in the letter. But he is already entered; the public, more and more as he is known, are appreciating his talents and worth, and his Country would sustain a loss, if these were to be checked, by over delicacy on your Part. With sincere esteem and affectionate regard, I am ever yours

It is well to recur to the past and learn what ol­  
der men and sages of the Revoluition have said of  
this eloquent, but vilified statesman. The follow­  
ing letter was addressed to John Adams, on his  
election as President of the United States, by none  
other than Washington:  
MoNdAr, Feb. 20th, 1797.  
&quot;Dear sir:-I thank you for giving me the pe­  
rusal of the enclosed. The sentiments do honor  
to the head and heart of the writer; and if my  
wishes could be of any avail, they should go to you  
in a strong hope that yon will not withold merit from  
Mr. John G. Adams because he is your son; for,  
without intending to compliment the father or the  
mother, or to censure any others, I give it as my  
decided opinion, that M oldams is the most valuable  
public churacter we hare abroad, and there remains  
no doubt in my mind that he will prove himself to be  
the ablest of our diplomatic corps. If he was now  
to be brought into that line or into any other  
public walk, I should not, upon the principle which  
has regulated my own conduct, disapprove the  
caution which is hinted at in the letter. But he is  
already entered--the public more and more as he  
is known, are appreciating his talents and his  
worth-and his country would sustain a loss if  
these were to be checked by over-delicacy on  
your part.  
With sincere esteem and affectionate regard, I  
am ever yours. GEO. WASIlinGTON.
