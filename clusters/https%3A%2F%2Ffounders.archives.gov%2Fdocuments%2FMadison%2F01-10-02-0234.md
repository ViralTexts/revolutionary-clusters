 concluded the observations which were meant to introduce a candid survey of the plan of government reported by the convention, we now proceed to the execution of that part of our undertaking. The first question that offers itself is, whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican? It is evident that no other form would be reconcileable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the revolution; or with that honorable determination, which animates every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government. If the plan of the convention therefore be found to depart from the republican character, its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible.  
What then are the distinctive characters of the republican form? Were an answer to this question to be sought, not by recurring to principles, but in the application of the term by political writers, to the constitutions of different states, no satisfactory one would ever be found. Holland, in which no particle of the supreme authority is derived from the people, has passed almost universally under the denomination of a republic. The same title has been bestowed on Venice, where absolute power over the great body of the people, is exercised in the most absolute manner,

y nobles. Poland, which is a mixture of aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms, has been dignified with the same appellation. The government of England, which has one republican branch only, combined with a hereditary aristocracy and monarchy, has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the list of republics. These examples, which are nearly as dissimilar to each other as to a genuine republic, shew the extreme inaccuracy with which the term has been used in political disquisitions.  
If we resort for a criterion, to the different principles on which different forms of government are established, we may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people; and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behaviour. It is essential to such a government, that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic. It is sufficient for such a government, that the persons administering it be appointed, either directly or indirectly, by the people; and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just specified; otherwise every government in the United States, as well as every other popular government that has been or can be well organised or well executed, would be degraded from the republican character. According to the constitution of every state in the union, some or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly

ime during his continuance in office. The tenure by which the judges are to hold their places, is, as it unquestionably ought to be, that of good behaviour. The tenure of the ministerial offices generally will be a subject of legal regulation, conformably to the reason of the case, and the example of the state constitutions.  
Could any further proof be required of the republican complexion of this system, the most decisive one might be found in its absolute prohibition of titles of nobility, both under the federal and the state governments; and in its express guarantee of the republican form to each of the latter.  
But it was not sufficient, say the adversaries of the proposed constitution, for the convention to adhere to the republican form. They ought with equal care, to have preserved the federal form, which regards the union as a confederacy of sovereign states; instead of which, they have framed a national government, which regards the union as a consolidation of the states. And it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken. The handle which has been made of this objection requires, that it should be examined with some precision.  
Without enquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which the objection is founded, it will be necessary to a just estimate of its force, first to ascertain the real character of the government in question; secondly, to enquire how far the convention were authorised to propose such a government; and thirdly, how far the duty they owed to their country, could supply any defect of regular authority.  
First. In order to ascertain the real character of the government it may be considered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be established; to the sources from which its ordinary powers are to be drawn; to the operation of those powers; to the extent of them; and to the authority by which future changes in the government are to be introduced.  
On examining the first relation, it appears on one hand that the constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people of America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose; but on the other that this assent and ratification is to be given by the people, not as individuals composing one entire nation; but as composing the distinct and independent states to which they respectively belong. It is to be the assent and ratification of the several states derived from the supreme authority in each state, the authority of the people themselves. The act therefore establishing the constitution, will not be a national but a federal act.  
That it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms are understood by the objectors, the act of the people as forming so many independent states, not as forming one aggregate nation is obvious from this single consideration, that it is to result neither from the decision of a majority of the people of the union, nor from that of a majority of the states. It must result from the unanimous assent of the several states that are parties to it, differing no other wise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed, not by the legislative authority, but by that of the people themselves. Were the people regarded in this transaction as forming one nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the United States, would bind the minority; in the same manner as the majority in each state must bind the minority; and the will of the majority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual votes; or by considering the will of the majority of the states, as evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the United States. Neither of these rules has been adopted. Each state in ratifying the constitution, is considered as a sovereign body independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary act. In this relation then the new constitution will, if established, be a federal and not a national constitution.  
The next relation is to the sources from which the ordinary powers of government are to be derived. The house of representatives will derive its powers from the people of America, and the people will be represented in the same proportion, and on the same principle, as they are in the legislature of a particular state. So far the government is national not federal. The senate on the other hand will derive its powers from the states, as political and co-equal societies; and these will be represented on the principle of equality in the senate, as they now are in the existing congress. So far the government is federal, not national. The executive power will be derived from a very compound source. The immediate election of the president is to be made by the states in their political characters. The votes allotted to them, are in a compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct and co-equal societies; partly as unequal members of the same society. The eventual election, again is to be made by that branch of the legislature which consists of the national representatives; but in this particular act, they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations from so many distinct and co-equal bodies politic. From this aspect of the government, it appears to be of a mixed character, presenting at least as many federal as national features.  
The difference between a federal and national government, as it relates to the operation of the government, is, by the adversaries of the plan of the convention, supposed to consist in this, that in the former, the powers operate on the political bodies composing the confederacy, in their political capacities; in the latter, on the individual citizens composing the nation, in their individual capacities. On trying the constitution by this criterion, it falls under the national, not the federal character; though perhaps not so compleatly as has been understood. In several cases, and particularly in the trial of controversies to which states may be parties, they must be viewed and proceeded against in their collective and political capacities only. But the operation of the government on the people in their individual capacities, in its ordinary and most essential proceedings, will on the whole, in the sense of its opponents, designate it in this relation, a national government.  
But if the government be national with regard to the operation of its powers, it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation to the extent of its powers. The idea of a national government involves in it, not only an authority over the individual citizens, but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they are objects of lawful government. Among a people consolidated into one nation, this supremacy is compleatly vested in the national legislature. Among communities united for particular purposes, it is vested partly in the general, and partly in the municipal legislatures. In the former case, all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme; and may be controuled, directed, or abolished by it at pleasure. In the latter, the local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more subject within their respective spheres to the general authority, than the general authority is subject to them within its own sphere. In this relation then, the proposed government cannot be deemed a national one; since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several states a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects. It is true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions, the tribunal which is ultimately to decide, is to be established under the general government. But this does not change the principle of the case. The decision is to be impartially made, according to the rules of the constitution; and all the usual and most effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality. Some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword, and a dissolution of the compact; and that it ought to be established under the general, rather than under the local governments; or to speak more properly, that it could be safely established under the first alone, is a position not likely to be combated.  
If we try the constitution by its last relation, to the authority by which amendments are to be made, we find it neither wholly national, nor wholly federal. Were it wholly national, the supreme and ultimate authority would reside in the majority of the people of the union; and this authority would be competent at all times, like that of a majority of every national society, to alter or abolish its established government. Were it wholly federal on the other hand, the concurrence of each state in the union would be essential to every alteration that would be binding on all. The mode provided by the plan of the convention, is not founded on either of these principles. In requiring more than a majority, and particularly, in computing the proportion by states, not by citizens, it departs from the national, and advances towards the federal character: In rendering the concurrence of less than the whole number of states sufficient, it loses again the federal, and partakes of the national character.  
The proposed constitution therefore, even when tested by the rules laid down by its antagonists, is in strictness, neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both. In its foundation it is federal, not national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn, it is partly federal, and partly national; in the operation of these powers, it is national, not federal; in the extent of them again, it is federal, not national; and finally, in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments, it is neither wholly federal, nor wholly national.

it otherwise would be. That this is the true the sory of the Con-  
stitution, is admitted by the writers of the ** Federalist.” ‘If  
the government be xational,” says Mr. Madison, “ with regard  
to the vperation of tts powers, it changes its aspect again when  
we contemplate it ta relation to the extent of its powers. The  
idea of a national government invelves in it, not only an autho-  
rity over the individual citizens, but an mdefinite supremacy  
over all persons and things, so far as they are objects of lawful  
government. Among a people consolidated imto one nation,  
this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature.  
Among communities united for particular purposes, it is vested  
partly inthe general, and partly ia the municipal legislatures.  
fu the former case, all local authorities are subordinate to the  
supreme ; and may be controlled, directed or abolished by it at  
its pleasure. lu the latter, the local or municipal authorities,  
form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no  
more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general  
authority, than the general authority is subject to them within  
its own sphere. Ln this relation, then, the proposed government  
cannot be deencd a national one,” &amp;e. We goa step farther  
than the text just cited. We conceive that not only ts the go-  
vernment of the United States, limited in its powers to those  
granted in the Federal Constitution, but that even in the ex-  
ercise of these, it is bound by the spirit and scheme of a contede

to make this position, “ that the adoption of the Constitution,  
will be a federal, and not a national act,” still more clear,  
the same authority goes on to say, ** the act of the people as  
forming so many independent States, not as forming one ag-  
gregute nation, is obvious from this single consideration, that  
it is to result neither from a majority of the people of the  
Union, or from that of a majority of the States. It must re-  
sult from the unavimous assent of the several States that are  
parties to it, differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent,  
than in its being expressed, not by the legislative authority, but  
by the people themselves. Were the people regarded in this  
trapsaction as forming one nation, the will of the majority of  
the whole people of the United States would bind the mino-  
rity in the same manner as the majority of each State must  
hind the minority ; and the will of the majority must be deter-  
mined either by a comparison of the individual votes, or by  
considering the will of the majority of the States as the evi-  
dence of the will of the majority of the people of the United  
States. Neither of these rules has been adopted. Each  
State, io ratifiying the Constitution, is considered as a sov-  
FREIGN BODY, independent of all others, and only to be bound  
by iw voluntary act. In this relation, the new Constitution  
will, if established, be a federal and not a national Constitu-  
tioa.” ‘This exposition is so exceedingly clear, that however  
abandant the authorities, it would be scarcely possible to add  
any thing to it. It might seem at first sight, to be very unim-  
portant to fix the right interpretation to be given to the origin  
of the power which gave authority to the Constitution, as it  
might be said that it matters not whether the people of the

** Resolved, That the Constitution of the United States is a  
  
compact between the People of the different States with each  
  
other, as separate and independent sovercigntics,” &amp;e.  
  
Mr. Madison says : ** On examining the first relation, it ap-  
pears, on the one hand, that the Constitution is to be founded  
on the assent and ratification of the People of America, given  
by deputies elected for the special purpose ; but, on the other,  
that this assent and ratification is to be given by the People, not  
as individuals, composing Gne entire nation, but as composing  
the distinct and independent States to which they respectively  
belong. It is to be the assent and ratification of the several  
States, derived from the supreme authority in each State, the  
authority of the People themselves. The act, therefore, of es-  
tablishing the Constitution, will not be a National, but a Fede-  
ral act.  
  
“ That it will be a Federal, and not a National act, as these  
terms are uuderstood by the objectors, the act of the People, as

iihi to prevent an appeal to tie word and a dissolu­

lisiud under the general, rather than under the local  
governments; or to speak more properly, that it  
could be safely established under the hrst alone, is a  
question not likely to be combated.&quot; Here, then, is  
the constitution and Mr. Madison on one hand, and  
that constitution adopted by the people with full no­  
tice given by Mr. Madison that it established a tri­  
bunal to avoid an appeal to the sw ord—and on the

This was an argument addressed to Conventions of the  
people in the several States, to induce them to ratify the con­  
stitution, and not to a Convention of tbe people of the United  
Sta|ee. By &quot; the consent of the people,&quot; the &quot;pure, original  
fountain of all legitimate authority,&quot; he meant the Conven­  
tions of the people in the several States, who, by their ratifi­  
cation of the conititution, were to establish it, each for itself,  
between tbe States bo ratifying it, if nine could be induced to  
do so.  
Mr. Mad.son is still more explicit and particular. He says :  
&quot; It is to be the assent and ratification of the several States,  
&#x27;deiived from the supreme authority in each State, the au­  
1 thority of tbe people themselves. The act, therefore, estab­  
4 lishing the constitution will not be a national act, but a  
&#x27;federal act. That it will be a federal, and not a na­  
&#x27; lioual act, as these terms are understood by the objectors, the  
&#x27; act of the people, as forming so many independent States,  
&#x27; not as forming one aggregate nation, ia obvious- from this  
&#x27; single consideration : that it is to result neither from the de­  
&#x27; cision of a majority of the people of the Union, nor from that  
&#x27; of a majority of the States. It must result from the unani­  
&#x27; mous assent of the several States thbt are parties to it, diifer­  
&#x27; ing no otherwise from their ordinary assent than in i&#x27;a being  
&#x27; expressed, not by the legislative authority, but by that of ihe  
&#x27; people themaelves. Were the people regarded in thia trane­  
&#x27; action aa forming one nation, tbe will of the majority of the  
* whole people of the United States would bind the minority,  
&#x27; in the same manner aa the majority in each State must bind  
&#x27;the minority; and the will of the majority must be deter*  
&#x27; mined either by a comparison of the individual votes, or by  
&#x27;considering the will of the majority of the States aa evidence  
&#x27;of the will of the majority of the people of the United States.  
* Neither of these rulea has been adopted. Each State, in  
&#x27;ratifying tbe constitution, is considered as a sovereign body,  
&#x27; independent of all others, and only to be bjund by its own  
* voluntary act. In this relation, then, the new constitution  
&#x27;will, if established, be a federal, and not a national consti­  
tution.&quot;  
Such was the understanding of the Conventions of ihe ori­  
ginal twelve tlave S ate?, and of the one non-elave Slate,

I Speaking of the extent of the powers of the General  
Government, he says: 44 In this relation, then, the

&#x27; tional one, since its jurisdiction extends to certain

4 relating to the boundary between the two juris­

4 is to be established under the General Govern­

&quot; On examining the first relation, it appears, on  
the one hand, that the constitution is to be founded  
on the assent and ratification of the people of  
America, given by deputies elected for the special  
purpose ; but on the other, tnat this assent and  
ratification is to be given by the people, not as in  
dividuals composing one entire nation, but as com  
posing the distinct and independent states to which  
they respectively belong. It is to be the assent  
and ratification of the several states, derived from  
the supreme authority in each state the authori­

the general form and aspbet of the Government  
be strictly republican T It is evident that no  
sther form would be reconcilable with the genius  
of the people ot v merica, with the fundamental  
principles f the Revolution, or with that  
honorable determination which animates every  
FOtary of Freedom, to rest all onr political experiments  
on the capacity of MANKIND for  
telf government. If the plan of the Convention,  
therefore, be found to depart from the republitan  
character, its advocates must abandon it as  
no longer defensible. What, then, are the distinctive  
characters of the republican form?  
Were an answer to this question to be sought,  
not by recurring to principles, but in the application  
of the term, by political writers, to the 1  
Constitutions of different States, no satisfactory  
one could be found.

THE MAseRiwt small cov  
A Republic is a government which  
derives all its powers directly or indi-­  
rectly from the great body of the peo-­  
ple, and is administered by persons  
holding their offices during a limited  
period, or during good behavior. The  
will of the people is ascertained and  
expressed by a majority of the votes  
cast by those entitled to the elective  
franchise.  
  
This method of determining the will  
of the people, is the only safe and true  
rule in a Republic. It is true that  
very often a majority of the votes do  
not constitute a majority of the peo-­  
ple, for as is the case in our Republic,  
women, minors, negroes, and some few  
others, such as idiots and lunatics, do  
not vote, but only the rree whire  
MALe CItizeN, and a majority of these  
govern the State in the manner de-­  
fined in the Constitution.

the Constitution was denounced everywhere. Mr

&quot;In order to ascertain the real character of the Govern­  
ment, it mav be considered in relation to the foundation  
on which it is to be established;&#x27; to the sources from  
which its ordinary powers are to be drawn; to the opera  
tion of those powers; to the extent of them; and to the au­  
thority by which future changes in the Government are  
to be introduced.  
&quot;On examining the first relation, it appears, on one  
hand, that the Constitution is to be founded on the assent  
and ratification of the people of America, given by depu­  
ties elected for the special purpose; but, on the other,  
that this assent and ratification is to be given by the peo­  
ple, not as individuals composing one entire nation, but  
as composing the distinct and independent States to  
which they respectively belong. It is to be the assent  
and ratification of the several States, derived from the su­  
preme authority in each State—the authority of the  
people themselves. The act, therefore, establishing the  
Constitution will not be a national, but a federal act. .  
&quot;That it will be a federal, and not a &quot;national act, as  
these terms are understood by the objectors, the act of  
the people, as forming so many independent States, not  
as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious, from this  
single consideration, that it is to result neither from the  
decision of a majority of the people or the Union, nor  
from that of a majority of the States. It must result from  
the unanimous assent of the several States that are par­  
ties to it, differing no otherwise from their ordinary as­  
sent than in its being expressed, not by the legislative au­  
thority, but by that of the people themselves. Were the  
people regarded in this transaction as forming one nation,  
the will of the majority of the whole people of the United  
States would bind the minority, in the same manner as  
tlie majority in each State must hind the minority; and  
the will of the majority must be determined either by  
a comparison of the individual votes, or by considering  
the will of the majority of the States, as evidence of the  
will of a majority of the people of tho United Slates.  
Neither of these rules has been adopted. Each State, in  
ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign  
body, independent of all others, and only to be bound by  
its own voluntary act. In this relation, then, the new  
Constitution will, if established, be a federal, and not a  
national Constitution.  
&quot;The next relation is, to the sources from which the  
ordioary powers of Government are to be derived.  
The House of Representatives will derive its powers from  
the people of America, and the people will be represented  
in the same proportion, aud on the same principle, as they  
are in the Legislature of a particular State. So far the  
Government is national, not federal. The Senate, on the  
other hand, will derive its powers from the States, as po­  
litical and co-equal societies; and these will be represent­  
ed on the principle of equality in the Senate, as they now  
are in the existing Congress. So far the Government is  
federal, not national. The Executive power will be de­  
rived from a very compound source. The immediate elec­  
tion of tiie President is to be made by the States in their  
political characters. The votes allotted to them are in a  
compound ratio, which considers them partly as distinct  
and co equal societies; partly as unequal members of the  
same society. The eventual election, again, is to be made  
by that branch of the Legislature which consists of the  
national representatives; but in this particular act they  
are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations,  
from so many distinct and co-equal bodies politic. From  
this aspect of the Government, it appears to be of a mixed  
character, presenting at least as many federal as national  
features.  
&quot;The difference between a federal and national Govern­  
ment, as it relates to the operation of the Government, is,  
by tlie adversaries of tbe plan of the convention, supposed  
to consist in this, that in the former the powers operate  
on the political bodies composing the Confederacy, in  
their political capacities; in the latter, on the individual  
citizens composing the nations, in their individual capa­  
cities. On trying the Constitution by this criterion, it  
falls under the national, not the federal character; though  
perhaps not so completely as has been understood. In  
several cases, and particularly in the trial of controversies  
to which States may be parties, they must be viewed and  
proceeded against in their collective and political capaci­  
ties only. But the operation of the Government on the  
people in their individual capacities, in its ordinary and  
most essential proceedings, will, on the whole, in the  
sense of its opponents, designate it in this relation, a  
national Government.  
  
&quot;But if the Government be national, with regard to the  
operation of its powers, it changes its aspect again, when  
we contemplate it in relation to the extent of its powers.  
The idea of a national Government involves in it, not  
only an authority over the individual citizens, but an  
indefinite supremacy over all persons and things, so far  
as they are objects of lawful government. Among a peo­  
ple consolidated into one nation, this supremacy is com­  
pletely vested in the national Legislature. Among com­  
munities united for particular purposes, it is vested  
partly in the general, and partly in the municipal Legis­  
latures. In the former case, all local authorities are sub­  
ordinate to the supreme; and may be controlled, directed,  
or abolished by it at pleasure. In the latter, the local or  
municipal authorities form distinct and independent por­  
tions of the supremacy, no more subject, within their  
respective spheres, to the general authority, than the  
general authority is subject to them within its own  
sphere. In this relation, then, the proposed Government  
cannot be deemed a national one, since its jurisdiction  
extends to certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to  
the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty  
over all other objects. It is true, that in controversies  
relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions,  
the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be estab­  
lished under the General Government. But this does not  
change the principle of the case. The decision is to be  
impartially made, according to the rules of the Constitu­  
tion; and all the usual and most effectual precautions are  
taken to secure this impartiality. Some such tribunal is  
clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword, and  
a dissolution of the compact; and that it ought to be es­  
tablished under the general, rather than under the local  
Governments; or, to speak more properly, that it could be  
safely established under the first alone, is a position not  
likely to be combated.  
  
&quot;If we try the Constitution by its last relation, to the  
authority by which amendments are to be made, we find  
it neither wholly national, nor wholly federal. Were it  
wholly national, the supreme and ultimate authority  
would reside in the majority of the people of the Union;  
und this authority would be competent at all times, like  
that of a majority of every national society, to alter or  
abolish its established government. Were it wholly fed­  
eral on the other hand, the concurrence of each State in  
the Union would be essential to every alteration that  
w uld be binding on all. The mode provided by the plan  
of the convention is not founded on either of these prin­  
ciples. In requiring more than a majority, and particu­  
larly, in computing the proportion by States, not by citi­  
zens. it departs from the national, and advances towards  
tho federal character. In rendering the concurrence of  
less than the whole number of States sufficient, it loses  
again the federal, and partakes of the national character.  
&quot;The proposed Constitution, therefore, even when tested  
by the rules laid down by its antagonists, is, in strict­  
ness, neither a rational nor a federal Constitution, but a  
composition of both. In its foundation it is federal, not  
national; in the sources from which the ordinary powers  
of the Government are drawn, it is partly federal and  
partly national; in the operation of these powers, it is  
national, not federal; in the extent of them again, it is  
federal, not national; and finally, in the authoritative  
mode of introducing amendments, it is neither wholly  
federal nor wholly national.&quot;

But it. was not sufficient, say tho adrer?s  
&lt;&gt;j the proposed Constitution, for the  
vt:mn:i to adhere to the Republican form. |  
y ought, with equal care to have preserved  
federal form, which regard.! the Union as  
nftderncy of sovereign States; instead of  
eh they have framed a national Governt  
which regards the Union as a consolidate  
the Stales. And it is asked, by what  
lOritv this bold and radical innovation was  
ertaken ? The handle which has been  
e of this objection, requires that it should  
xaminid with souie precision.  
&quot;ithout enquiring into the accuracy of the  
inclion on which llie objection is founded,  
ill be necessary to a just estimate of its  
e, Gist, to ascertain the real character of |  
Government in question ; secondly, to en- j  
v how lar the Convention weie authorized J  
jropose such a Government: and third y, |  
the duty they owed to their country j  
d supply any defect of regular authority,  
irs.l. In order to ascertain the real churaeA  
the&#x27; Government, it may be considered  
elation to the foundation on which it is to  
stablished ; to the sources from which its  
nary powers-are to bo drawn ; to the ope&gt;11  
of those powers; to the extent of them;  
to the authority by which future changes  
lie Government are to be introduced,  
n examining the first, relation, it nppcam,  
on* hand, that the I&#x27;.institution is to he  
ided on the assent and ratification of the  
do of America, given by deputies elected  
die special purpose; but on the other, that  
assent and ratification is to be given by  
people, not as individuals composing one  
re nation, but as composing the distinct j  
independent Slates to which they respec- i  
!y belong. It is n&gt; bo ti e assent and rati- i  
;ion of the several Suites, derived from the !  
reme authority in each State?the million- j  
f the people themst Ives. The act therefore I  
Wishing the Constitution will not be a ?.u- :  
at, but a federal act  
hat it wili be a federal, and not a national  
n.&gt; these terms aie understood bv the ohms,  
the net of the people, as forming so  
  
iv independent Slater, 1101 as forming one  
regaie nation, is obvious from this single  
lidcration, that it is to result rcither from j  
decision of a of the people ol the  
on, nor that of a *n&gt;ijurity of tine Slate. !  
must result from the utmnhnous assent I  
he several Slun.s that are parties to I  
differing nn otherwise li&#x27; in their or- I  
iry assent h n in its being express-j  
not by tiic legislative authority, but i  
hat of the people themselves. Were the |  
)le regarded in this transaction as forming  
nation, the will ol the majority of lhe j  
le people of the United States would bind  
minority; in the same manner as themaj &gt;in  
each S&#x27;&amp;te must bind the minority; and  
tvill of the majority must be determined  
cr by ii comparison of the individual votes,  
y considei lug tiie will of the majority of  
Stales, as evidence &lt;&gt;f the will of a majority  
he people of the United Slates. Neither  
licse rules has been adopted. Each State, ;  
ttifying the Constitution, is considered as j  
ivcreign body, independent of a!! otliers, j  
only to be bound by its own voluntary act j

Itablished, be a federal, anu nut a national i  
stitutinn.  
he next relation is, to the sources from ;  
?n the ordinary powers of government ore  
e derived.  
he II ruse of Representatives will derive its &#x27;  
ers from the people of America, and the ;  
?le will be represented in the same propor- 1  
, and on the same principle, as they are in &lt;  
Legislature of a particular State. So far,  
government is national not federal. The j  
te, on the other harui, will derive its powers ,  
i the Stales, as political and coequal socie;  
und these will be represented on the  
ciplcof equality in the Senate, as they now !  
in the existing Congress. So far the Gov- j  
irent is feneral not national. The executive I  
er will be derived from a very compound i  
ce. The immediate election of the Presi-&#x27;  
, is to be made by the States in their po- j  
il characters. Iho votes allotted to them I  
  
are in compound ratio, which considers them  
partly as distinct and coequal societies ; partly  
as unequal members of the satne society. The  
eventual election again, is to be made by that  
branch of the Legislature which consists of  
the national representatives: but-in this particular  
act, they nre to be thrown into the form  
of individual delegations, from so many distinct  
and co-equal bodies politic. From this  
aspect of the government, it appears to be of a  
mixed character, presenting nt least us many  
federal ns national features.  
The difference between a federal and national  
government, a-, it relates to the operation  
of the government, is, by the adversaries of  
the plan of the Convention, supposed to consist  
in this, that in tin; former, the powers operate  
on the political bodies composing tbe  
Confederacy, in tlnir political capacities; in  
the latter, on the individual citizens composing  
the nation in their individual capacities. On  
trying the Constitution by this criterion, it  
fails under the national,not the federal character  
though perhaps not so completely as has been  
understood. In several cases, ami particularly  
in tbe triul of controversies to which States  
may he parties, they must tie viewed and proceeded  
against in their collective and political  
capacities only. Rut the operation of the government  
on the people in tln ir individual ca1  
pacifies, in its ordin *ry and most essential proceedings.  
will, on the whole, in the sense of its  
opponents, designate it, in lids relation, a national  
government.  
Rut, if the government be national, with regard  
to tlic o^erati-n of its powers, it changes  
its aspect again, when wccontemplate it in reiatiori  
to the extent of its powers. The idea of  
a National Government involves in it, not only  
an authority over tbe individual citizens, but  
an indefinite supremacy over all persons and  
things, ?o far us ib. y are objects of lawful government  
i Among a people consolidated into ono nation,  
i this supremacy is completely vested in the na:  
tiona! legislature. Among communities united  
for particular purposes, it is vested partly in  
the general and partly in the municipal legislatures.  
In the former case, n&#x27;l local authorities  
are subordinate to the supreme, and may be  
controlled, directed. or abolished by it at pleasure.  
In the latter, the local or municipal authorities  
form distinct and independent portions  
of supremacy, no nwre subject within their re;  
8;)ectivf spheres, to the general authority, than  
the general authority i- subject to them within  
its own sphere. In this rriution, then, the  
proposed government cannot be deemed a rut- |  
tiu.&#x27;uil one, since its jurisdiction extends to cer- j  
,,I.i..,.|&lt; ni.lv imii leaves to lllO i  
  
several State- a residuary ai d inviolable sovereignty  
over all other objects. It is true, that  
in controversies relating to the boundary be- 1  
tween the two jurisdictions, the tribunal which  
is ultimately to dec&#x27;tie is to be established un- {  
tier the Genera! Government. Hut this does i,  
not change the principle of ttie case. The dt-1&#x27;  
cision is To be impartially made, according to j &#x27;  
the rule- of tin* Constitution, and all the usual &lt;  
and most effectual piecaution.- are taken to se- i  
c.ire tiiis impartiality. Some such tribunal is j  
clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the j  
sword ami a dissolution of the compact, and . (  
; that it ought to be establish&quot;! under the gen- a  
: eral rather than under the local governments ;  
{ or, to speak more properly, that it could be ! (  
j mure safely established uml&lt; r the first alone, is )  
a position not likely to be conibatttd.  
If we try tlie Constitution by its last reia- j 1  
tion to lire authority bv which amendments I V  
are to be made, we find it neither wholly r.n- .  
tivnal, nor wholly j\(Ur&lt;il. Were it wholly I .  
national, the supreme aiid ultimate authority:  
would reside in the nmjoritii of the people of f  
the Union; ami tbi.-authority would be com-j  
petent, at all times, like that of a majority of1 s  
every national society, to alter or abolish its  
established government. Were it wholly federal,  
on tlu? oilier hand, tin- coo err nice of each ^  
State :n the Union would be essentia! to every  
alteration that would lie binding on all. &#x27;i&#x27;be q  
| mode provided by the plan &gt; f the Convention

end, will see that they were adapted to their par­  
ticelar logalities. Wherever there was opposition  
to the Constitution op a parligular subject, there  
the issue was made, and that matter was dizoussed;  
and there being a State rights feeling throughout  
the antire country, the federative character was  
held up prominently to view, and the idea of there  
being nationalism in the Constitution was denoun­  
eed everywhere. Mr. Madison wrote, in the thirty­  
ninth number of the Federalist, these words:  
&quot;On examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that  
the Censtitution is to be founded on the asient and ratification of  
the people of America, given by deputies elected for the special  
parpose; hut on the other, that thes assent and ratification is to  
be giyen by the peeple, not as individuals composing one entire  
nat on, but as composing the distinct and inze, endent States to  
which they respectively belong.&quot;  
And, because I have said that, my face has been  
laughed in here time and again; because I have  
said that there wag no such nation as the people  
of America; that there were no such people as the  
peeple of America; that there were no cltizees of

impossible that thers can be any sitigen of the  
United States; but thay are citigens of the several  
States. This is the language of Mr. Madison, when  
he was writing this article to make it acceptable to  
the people of Virginia,  
&quot;This assent and ratification is to be given by the people, not  
as individuals composing one centre nation, but as composing the  
distinct and independent States to a hich they respectively be­

of the Union, nor from a majority of the States. It must result  
from the ungnichious assent of the seyeral States that are par­

| we contemplate it in relation to the eatent of its powers.  
| The idea of a national Government involves in it not only  
  
an authority over the individual citizens, but an indefinite  
supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they are  
objects of lawful government. Among a people consoli-  
dated into one nation, this supremacy is completely vested  
in the national Legislature. Among communities united  
for particular purposes, it is vested partly in the general,  
  
| and partly inthe municipal Legislatures. In the former case,  
  
all Jocal authorities are subordinate to the supreme, and  
nay be controlled, directed, or aboiished by it at pleasure.  
In the latter, the local or municipal authorities torm dis  
tinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more  
subject, within their respective spheres, to the general au-  
thority than the general authority is subject to them within  
its ownsphere. In this relation, then, the proposed gov-  
ernment cannot be deemed a national one, since Its Juris-  
diction extends to certain enumerated objects oniy, and  
leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sov-  
ercignty over all other objects.”  
  
I think if the present President of the United  
States had read this passage, he would have been  
able to understand the distinction between the  
relations of a county toa State and the reiations  
of a State to the Federal Government. There  
exists, then, this broad Jistinction between the  
Federal and the State governments: the State  
governments exist by the consent of the govern d,  
under the law of the social compact; but the  
Federal Government exists, not as the result of  
the implied compact which arises under that law

‘ therein made ought to be strictly construed by all the de-  
‘ partments and agents of the Government, and that it is in-  
‘ expedient and dangerous to exercise doubtful constitutional  
‘ powers.’ The language here applied to the Constitution of  
the United States is in no degree stronger than that to be  
found in tlie xxxixth number of the ‘ Federalist,’ in which the  
relations of the National and Federal character of the Union  
were skilfully and accurately drawn by Mr. Ma lison. He  
lays it down that ‘ the assent and ratification of the people of  
‘ America was given to the Constitution, not as individuals  
‘ composing one entire nation, but as composing the distinct and  
‘ independent States to which they respectively belong. The  
‘ Constitution was so adopted, not by the majority of the people  
‘ of tlie United States binding the minority, but by the volun-  
^ tary act of each State considered as a sovereign body, inde-  
‘ pendent of all others.’ And again : ‘ The idea of a national  
‘ government involves in- it, not only an authority over the  
  
* individual citizens, but an indefinite supremacy ovor all per-  
‘ sons and things, so far as they arc objects of lawful govern-  
  
* ment. Among a people consolidated into one nation this su-  
  
* premacy is completely vested in the national legislature. In  
‘ this relation, then, the proposed government cannot be deemed  
‘ a nation&#x27;ll one, since its jurisdiction extends to certain enume-  
  
* rated o\»jects only, and leaves to the States a residuary and  
‘ inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.’ We are at a  
loss to conceive how it can be asserted, in direct contradiction  
to the express dicta of the authors of the Constitution, that the  
Union has, or ever has had, the power of a national govern¬  
ment supreme over the whole people of the United States.  
That doctrine, in its present violent and exaggerated form, is  
new in American constitutional law; and unhappily it no  
longer falls under the jurisdiction of that tribunal which was  
regarded by the authors of the ‘ Federalist’as ‘ clearly essential  
‘ to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the  
‘ compact.’

authority would reside in the majority of the people of the |  
  
Union, and this authority would be competent at all times,  
like that of a majority of every national society, to alter or  
abolish its established government. Were it wholly fed  
eral, on the other hand, the concurrence of each State in  
the Union would be essential to every alteration that would  
be binding on all.”? The mode provided by the Constitu  
tion for its amendment * is not founded on either of these  
principles.”? * In requiring more than a majority, and par-  
ticularly in computing the proportion by States, not by cit  
izens, it departs from the national and advances toward  
the federal character. In rendering the concurrence of less  
than the whole number of States sufficient, it loses again  
the federal and partakes of the national character.”? The  
Government created by the Constitution of the United  
Suates, therefore, is neither a national nor a federal Gov  
ernment, but a composition of both. * In its foundation it  
is federal, not national, In the sources from which the or-  
dinary powers of the Government are drawn, it is partly  
tederal and partly national. In the operation of these pow-  
ers itis national, not federal; in the extent of them, it is  
federal, not national.”’

the real character of the Government is considered  
in relation to the foundation on which it is estab-  
lished. In the thirty-eighth number of the Fed-  
eralist, Mr. Madison remarks:  
  
‘It appears, on one hand, that the Constitution is to be  
founded on the assent and ratification of the people of Amer-  
ica, given by deputies elected for the special purpose ; but,  
on the other, that the assent and ratification is to be given  
by the people, not as individuals composing one entire na-  
tion, but as composing the distinct and independent States  
to which they respectively belong. It is to be the assent  
and ratification of the several States derived from the su-  
preme authority of the people themselves. The act, there-  
fore, establishing the Constitution will not be a national  
but a Federal act. Thatit will be a Federal and not a na-  
  
the act of the people as forming so many independent States,  
-not as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious from this  
single consideration, that itis to result neither from the de-  
cision of the majority of the people of the Union nor from  
that of a majority of the States. It must result from the  
unanimous assent of the several States that are parties to it,  
differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent than in its  
being expressed, not by the legislative authority, but by that  
ofthe people themselves. Were the people regarded in this  
transaction as forming one nation, the will of the majority  
of the whole people of the United States would bind the  
minority in the same manner as the majority in each State  
must bind the minority, and the will of the majority must  
be determined cither by a comparison of the individual votes  
or by considering,the will of the majority of the States as  
evidence of the will of the majority of the people of the  
United States. Neither of these rules has been adopted.  
Each State in ratifying the Constitution is considered as a  
eovercign body, independent of all others, and only to be  
bound by its own voluntaryact. In this relation, then, the  
‘new Constitution will, if established, be a Federal and not  
  
Again, he remarks:  
  
* The Senate will derive its power from the States as po.  
litical and coequal societies, and these will be represented  
on the prineiple of equality inthe Senate. So far the Gov-  
ernment is Federal, not national.”’  
  
The admission that in some respects the Gov-  
ernment is also national end in others partly na-  
tional and partly Federal, does not affect the prop-  
osition asserted by Mr. Madison and known to  
  
‘* several States are parties to that Constitution”  
or compact of Government. And yet, sir, we are  
gravely told that the representatives of the States  
in their sovereign capacity, parties to that con-

represent, sustain the same relation to the Unite

6 of the Federalist:  
  
** The idea of a national Government involves in it not  
only an authority over the individual citizen, but an indefi-  
nite supremacy Over all persons and things, so far as they  
are objects of lawful government. Among a people consol-  
idated into one nation this supremacy is completely vested  
in the national Legislature. Among communities united  
for particular purposes it is vested partly in the general and  
partly in the municipal Legislatures. In the former case  
all local authorities are subordinate to the supremie, and  
may be controlled, directed, or abolished by it at pleasure.  
(n the latter, the local or municipal authorities form dis-  
tinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more  
subject within their respective spheres to the general au-  
thority than the general authority is subject to them within  
its own sphere.  
  
* In this relation, then, the proposed Government cannot  
be deemed a national one, since its jurisdiction extends to  
certain enumerated objects.only, and leaves to the several  
States a residuary and inviclabie sovereignty overall other  
objects.”?

Am I correct? Let us appeal to Mr. Madison

which I have already quoted, in which he appeals  
to the people to ratify the Constitution submitted  
to the States:  
  
“This assent and ratification is to be given by the people,  
not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as com-

other matters.&quot;

dison said :  
  
‘*The Constitution will not be a national,

and not a national act, is obvious from this  
single consideration, that it is the result nei-

for his deeds either in the Constitution  
orin the writings of any statesman  
connected with the constitutional pe-  
riod of our history. Madison, who has  
been credited with the largest share of  
the authorship of the Constitution, was  
very clear in his assertion of the now  
tabooed doctrines of State sovereignty,  
and against the proclaimed policy of  
a consolidated national goverument.—  
  
He said :  
  
‘On examining the first relation, it ap-  
pears, on one hand, that the Constitution is  
to be founded on the assent and ratification  
of the people of America, given by deputies  
elected for that special purpose - but, on the  
other, that this assent and ratification are to  
be given by the people, not as individuals  
comprising one entire nation, but as com-  
posing the distinet and independent States  
to which they respectively belong. It is to  
be the assent and ratification of the several  
States, dcrived from the supr2me authority of  
each State. The act, therefore, establishing  
the Constitution will not be a rational but a  
federal act. Thatit will be a federal, and  
not a national act, as these terms are under-  
stood by the objectors, (and by the Republi-  
cans of our day,) the act of the people, as  
forming so many independent States, not as  
forming one aggreqate nation, is obvious from  
this single-consideration, that it is to resnlt  
neither from the decision of a majori!y of the  
people of the Union, nor from that of a ma-  
jority of the States. It must result from the  
unanimous assent of the several States that

believed the Federal Government had no  
power to do.  
Mr. Madison, in the twenty-ninth num­  
ber of the Federalist, discussing the charac­  
ter of the then proposed Constitution, and  
to prove that it created a Federal, and not a  
Vational Government, says:  
&quot;The idea of a national Government involves in  
it not only an authority over the individual citizens,  
but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and  
things, so far as they are ob ects of lawful govern­  
me I ong a people consolidated into one nation,  
this supremacy is completely vested in the national  
Legislature. Among communities united for par­  
ticular purposes, it is vested partly in the general and  
partly in the municipal Legislatures. In the former  
case, all local authorities are subordinate to the su­  
preme, and may be controlled, directed, or abolished  
by it at pieasure. In the latter the local or munict­  
pal authorities form adletluct and independent por­  
tions of the supremacy, no more subject within  
their respective sphares to the goneral authority than  
the general authority is subject to them within its  
own sphere.  
&quot;In this relation, then, the proposed Government  
cannot be deemed a national one, ince its jurisdic­  
tion extends to certain enumerated objects only, and  
leaves to the everal States a residuary and inviola­  
ble sovereignty over other objects.&quot;

question, speaking of the adoption of th

&quot;Were the peple regarded in this transaction as  
forming one, the will of the majority of the whole  
popie of the United States woud bind the mirority  
in the same manner as the majority in each State  
must bind the minority; and the will of the mal rity  
must be determined by a comparison of the individ­  
ual votes, or by considering the will of the majority  
of the States, as evidence of te majority of the peo­  
ple of the UniteI States. Neither of these rules has  
been adooted. Each State in ratifying the onsti­  
tution is considered as a sovereign bo y, indepen­  
dent of all others, ant only to be bound by its own  
voluntary act. In this relation, then, the new Con  
stitution will, if established, be a Federal, and not a  
National Constitution.&quot;  
But each of the States in ratifying the  
Constitution gave expression to the strong  
and unmistakable sentiment of the people,  
that the Government formed thereby should  
be one of limited and delegated powers  
only.  
The State of Massachusetts, in her Con­

Mr. Madison then alluded to the idea  
that the difference between a federal

to the operation of the government, con­

under a single signature, Hamilton and  
Jay mnust be regarded as equally concur-  
  
ring in and making the explanation.  
In the 39th number, Publius thus  
states a principal objection of the adver­  
saries of the proposed constitution: &quot;It  
was not sufficient for the convention to  
adhere to the republican form. They  
ought, with equal care, to have pre­  
served the federal form, which regards  
the Chion as a Confederacy of sovereign  
states; instead of which they have  
framed a national Government, which  
regards the Union as a consolidation of  
the States.&quot; It was asked, he said, by  
what authority &quot;this bold and radical  
innovation&#x27; was undertaken? and the  
handle made of the objection, he said,  
required that it should be examined  
with some precision.  
He then proceeded to inquire, first, as  
to &quot;the real character of the Government  
in question.&quot; And as to tex he said:  
&quot;It appears, on the one hand, that the

States, not as forming one aggregate na­

ae  single consideration that it is to resut  
  
neither from the decision of a mojorily  
of the people of the Union, nor from that  
of a mojority of the States. It must re­  
sult from the unanintons assent of the  
several States that are parties to it, dif­  
ferent no otherwise from their ordinary  
assent, than in its being expressed,  
not by the legislative authority, but  
by that of the people them­  
selves.&quot; The people, he said, were  
not regarded, in this transaction, a  
forming one nation; for, if they were,  
the will of the majority of the whole  
people of the United States would bind  
the minority, that being ascertained by  
count of the individual votes; or regard-  
ng the will of a majority of the States  
as evidence of it. But, he said, &quot;Each  
State, in ratifying the Constitution, is  
considered a sovereign body, independ­  
ent of all others, and only to be bound  
by its own voluntary act.&quot;  
The Senate,&quot; he said, &quot;will derive  
its powers from the States, as political  
and co-equal societies; and these will be  
represented, on the principle of equality,  
in the Senate, as they now are in the  
existing Congress. So far, he said, the

Does not Hamilton here affirm the  
right and the ability of a State to  
resist, with force of arms, the en-  
croachments or usurpations of the  
Federal Government? The sameis  
affirmed by Madison in the Forty-  
fiith Article of the Federalist. Did  
these men understand the character

which they bore the most promi-  
nent and responsible part? In an-  
other article Madison said :  
  
‘The act, therefore, of establishing the  
Constitution, will not be a national but a  
federal act. Each State, in ratifying the  
Constitution, is considered as a sovereign  
body, independent of all others, and only  
to be bound by its own voluntary act. In  
this respect, then, the new Constitution  
will be, if established, a federal and nota

says: &quot;The idea of a National government  
involves in it an indefinite su­  
premacy over all persons and things, so far  
a3 they are objects of lawful government.  
Among a people consolidated into one na­

the National Legislature. Among commu­  
nities united for particular purposes, it is  
vested partly in the general and partly in  
municipal legislatures. In the former case,  
all local authorities are subordinate to the  
supreme, and may be controlled, directed or  
abolished by it at pleasure. In the latter,  
the local or municipal authorities form dis­

premacy, no more subject, within their re­

than the general authority is subject to them

able as was ever penned. ‘That it will be a federal, and not a  
national act’, continues The Federalist, ‘as these terms are under-  
stood by objectors, the act of the people as forming so many  
independent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is ob-  
vious from this single consideration, that it is to result neither  
from the majority of the people of the Union, nor from that of a

of the several States that are parties to it, differing no otherwise  
from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed, not by the  
legislative authority, but by that of the people themselves. Were  
the people regarded in this transaction as forming one nation,  
the will of the majority of the whole people of the United States  
would bind the minority; and the will of the majority must be  
determined either by a comparison of the individual votes, or by  
considering the will of the majority of the States, as evidences of —  
the will of a majority of the people of the United States. Neither  
of these has been adopted. [In fact, both of these modes of rati-

proceeds to say (page 265 Towson’s Ed.): “In this relation,  
then, the proposed government cannot be deemed a national one,  
since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects onlv,  
and leaves to the several States a residuary and inviolable sov-  
ereignty over all other objects. It is true that in controversies  
relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions, the  
tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be established under  
the general government. But this does not change the principle  
of the case. The decision is to be impartially made, according to  
the rules of the Constitution, and all the usual and most effectual  
precautions are taken to secure this impartiality. Some such  
tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword  
and a dissolution of the compact.”

The sources from which the pow­

are neither -wholly Federal nor

both. The House of Representa­

people of the United States, who  
are represented iu that branch of  
Congress in the same proportion,  
and on the same principle, as they  
are in the legislature of a particu­

is National. On the other hand, the  
Senate derives its power from the  
States as political and coequal so­  
cieties, the Legislature of ec.ch  
State electing two Senators and no  
more. So far the Government is  
Federal.

the immediate election of the  
President is to be made by th§  
States, in their political characters,  
the votes allotted them are in a com­

States shall be necessary to a choice.  
From this aspect of the government  
it appears to be of a mixed charac­  
ter, presenting at least as many  
Federal as National features.  
But iu considering the extent of  
the powers of the Government  
it assumes a Federal character.  
The Constitution provides that  
the judicial authority of the Gov­  
ernment shall extend to certain  
objects. These objects are spe­  
cifically enumerated and defined,  
and it has not jurisdiction over any  
others. The line is distinctly mark­  
ed and drawn botweeu the Federal  
and State Courts. The former have  
no right to invade the latter, nor  
can the State Courts be upheld in  
any attempt to invade the Federal  
Courts. Each is supreme within the  
orbit provided by the Constitution,  
and there must be no wandering  
out this well-defined orbit. Again,  
the Government assumes a partly  
National and partly Federal char­  
acter as to amending the Constitu­  
tion: In requiring more than a  
majority of States to ratify an  
amendment, and - computing the  
proportion by States, not by citizens,  
the authority advances towards the  
Federal character. But in render­  
ing the concurrence of less than the  
wholo number of States sufficient,  
the authority loses again the Fede­  
ral and partakes of the National  
character.  
These rules prove that the Con­  
stitution of the United States is  
neither a Federal nor National Con­  
stitution, but a composition of both,  
aud in making changes this dual  
character should not be lost sight  
of.  
It is only by preserving the prop­  
er checks aud balances that we can  
hope to prevent the government  
from becoming a consolidated des­  
potism, or like many of the ancient  
Republics, which, having no well  
defined powers, lost, their liberty in

the constitution. By a series of  
ingenious see-saw arguments he  
endeavored to show thaf^it was neither a  
national nor a federal one, but a  
composition of both. It was federal, for  
instance, because it was to be ratified  
by conventions elected bv the people,  
not; as individuals composing one  
-entire nation, but .as ~composing the  
distinct and independent ttates to which  
they respectively belonged. And on ihe  
other hand it was a national one,  
because the government would operate on  
the individual citizens composing the  
nation in their individual capacities,  
and not oil the political bodies  
composing the confederacy in their  
political capacities

 a state of things impossi-

whether popular government, strictly so called, is to be  
prized as highly as its advocates claim.  
  
Under the impulse given at the formation of the Gov-  
ernment by the members of a certain political school we  
have pursued a course tending more and more toward  
the centralization of power. That it was not with eyes  
shut to the effect of the provisions contained in the Con-  
stitution, that the latter was adopted may be considered  
as established. “The House of Representatives,” ob-  
serves an author of the period,* “will derive its powers  
from the people of America; and the people will be rep-

~4 as they are in the Legislature of a particular State.  
far the Government is National, not Federal. The  
Senate, on the other hand, will derive its powers from  
the States, as political and co-equal societies; and these  
will be represented on the principle of equality in the  
Senate, as they now are in the existing Congress. So  
far the Government is Federal, not National. The ex-  
ecutive power will be derived from a very compound  
source. The immediate election of the President is to  
be made by the States in their political characters. The  
votes allotted to them are in a compound ratio, which  
considers them partly as distinct and co-equal societies,  
partly as unequal members of the same society. The  
eventual election, again, is to be made by that branch  
of the Legislature which consists of the National Rep-  
resentatives; but in this particular act they are to be  
thrown into the form of individual delegations from so  
many distinct and co-equal bodies politic. From this  
aspect of the Government, it appears to be of a mixed  
  
character, presenting at least as many Federal as Na-  
tional features.”
