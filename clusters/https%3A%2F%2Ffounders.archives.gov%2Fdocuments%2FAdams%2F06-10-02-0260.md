ntries have judged that the said end cannot be better obtained than by taking the most perfect equality and reciprocity for the basis of their agreement, by leaving each party at liberty to make such interior regulations respecting commerce and navigation as it shall find most convenient and by founding the advantage of commerce on reciprocal utility and the just rules of free intercourse. On these principles the parties after mature deliberation have agreed to the following articles.  
Art. I. There shall be a firm, inviolable and universal peace and sincere friendship between their High Mightinesses the states of the seven United provinces of the low countries and the united states of North America, and the subjects and people of the said parties, and between the countries, islands, cities and towns situated under their respective jurisdictions, and the people and inhabitants thereof, of every degree without exception of persons or places.  
Art. II. The subjects of the said states of the low countries shall pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, islands, cities or towns of the united states of North America or any of them no other or greater duties or imposts of what nature so ever they may be or by what name so ever called, than those which the nations most favoured are or shall be obliged to pay. And they shall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce whether in passing from one port in the said States to another or in going to and from the same from and to any part of the world, which the said nations do or shall enjoy.  
Art. III. The converse of article second.  
Art. IV. There shall be a full perfect and entire liberty of Conscience allowed to the subjects of each party and to their families as to matters of religion and a full and entire liberty to worship in their own way without any kind of molestation. Moreover liberty shall be given to the subjects of either party who die in the territories of the other to be interred in convenient and decent places to be appointed for that purpose as occasion shall require; neither shall the dead bodies of those who are buried be any wise molested.

a clear case of abuse  
of the process of the Court, for which all those nc  
lively concerned should be held to account at the  
bar of the V ublic. I he next thing winch maybe  
expected is a suit by a runaway slave, claiming of  
his quondam maBterot the bouth, whom he meets  
in New York, compensation or damages fur con­  
straint which may have been exercised upon him  
while lawfully held in bondage.  
We proceed to quote the article nf the Treaty of  
1795 between the United Slates and opam, renewed  
and confirmed by the Treaty of 1819 with the same  
Power,) ta which we have referred. It is in these  
words:  
&#x27; All ships and merchandize, of what nature toe­  
&quot; tir, which shall be rescued cut of the hands of any  
&quot;pirates or robbers, on the high seas, thull be  
&quot; brought into some port of either Slate, and shall

&quot; to the true proprietor, as soon as due and suf.

&#x27; thereof.&quot;  
It is observable, by the way, that there is som&quot;  
variance between the Spanish and English sides of  
the treaty; but both, we believe, are held to be  
originals. On the Spanish side there are no words  
expressly corresponding with the words &quot; or rub­  
bers&quot; in the English version. The word pirates  
is alone died.  
By this article, it would appear to be engaged by

The 9th article of the treaty between Spain and the United States,  
dated 27th October, 1795, ( which has been continued in force by a sub.  
sequent treaty,) is as follows: * Allshipsand merchandise of what nature

This makes the case much stronger in favor of the Spanish claimants.

 the treaty bearing on this point is that  
Spain is to have the privilege of searching  
American merchantmen only when it is at  
war with another nation. In Section 18 of  
the treaty, which is regarded by some as  
covering the case of the Allianca, the right  
is given ‘‘to any ship of war” or “any  
privateer ’’ to board an American merchant  
vessel. State Department officials say that  
the reference to privateers furnishes the  
best of evidence that the section was de-  
signed to apply to a time of war.  
  
The Treaty Provisions,  
  
The articles of the treaty of 1895  
brought into question read:  
  
“Article XII,—The merchant ships of  
either of the parties which shall be mak-  
ing into a port belonging to the enemy of  
the other party, and concerning whose  
voyage and the species of good on board  
of her there shall be just grounds of sus-  
pion, shall be obliged to exhibit as well  
upon the high seas as in the ports and  
havens, not only her passports, but like-  
wise certificates expressly showing that her  
goods are not of the number of those  
which have been prohibited as contraband.
