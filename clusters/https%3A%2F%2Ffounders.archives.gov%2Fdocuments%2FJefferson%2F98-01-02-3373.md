much is known to one which is not known to another; and no one knows every thing. it is the sum of individual knoleges which is to make up the whole truth, and to give it’s correct current thro’ future time. then do not, dear Sir, withhold your stock of information; and I would more over recommend that you trust it not to a single copy, nor to a single depository. leave it not in the power of any one person, under the distempered view of an unlucky moment to deprive us of the weight of your testimony, &amp; to purchase by it’s destruction the favor of any party or person, as happened with a paper of Doctor Franklin’s.I cannot lay down my pen without recurring to one of the subjects of my former letter, for in truth there is no danger I apprehend so much as the consolidation of our government by the noiseless, and therefore unalarming instrumentality of the Supreme court. this is the form in which federalism now arrays itself, and consolidation is the present principle of distinction between republicans, and the pseudo-republicans but real federalists. I must comfort myself with the hope that the judges will see the importance and the duty of giving their country the only evidence they can give of fidelity to it’s constitution, and integrity in the administration of it’s laws. that is to say, by every one’s giving his opinion seriatim and publicly on the cases he decides. let him prove by his reasoning that he has read the papers that he has considered the case, that in the application of the law to it he uses his own judgement independantly and unbiassed by party views, and personal favor or disfavor. throw himself in every case on god and his country: both will excuse him for error and value him for his honesty. the very idea of cooking up opinions in Conclave begets suspicion that something passes which fears the public ear, and this spreading by degrees must produce at some time abridgement of tenure, facility of removal, or some other modification which may promise a remady. for in truth there is at this time more hostility to the federal judiciary than to any other organ of the government.I should greatly prefer, as you do, four judges to any greater number. great lawyers are not over–abundant, and the multiplication of judges only enables the weak to out-vote the wise; and the necessity of three concurrent opinions out of four, gives a strong presumption of right.I
