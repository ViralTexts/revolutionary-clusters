Sir  
Washington Dec. 16. 1802.  
  
Your favor of Nov. 30. has been duly recieved. the occlusion of the port of N. Orleans by the Spaniards, which is the subject of it, was calculated to give great alarm through the US. and especially the Western parts. information of it was recieved here from N. Orleans on the 6th. inst. and on the 8th. measures were taken to have the proceeding rectified. we think the evidence tolerably conclusive that it was not the consequence of any order from Europe, but merely an irregularity of the Intendant. measures were immediately put in motion for duly impressing him with the consequences of perseverance, and the Spanish minister here, expressing his entire conviction that the prohibition was unauthorised, undertook immediately to remonstrate to him against it, and also to dispatch a letter to the Govr. General who resides at the Havanna, to interpose efficaciously and without delay. we trust therefore that it will be as promptly remedied as the distance permits. it has furnished however a proper occasion of urging on Spain the danger of leaving the peace of the two countries exposed to the caprice of any officer, and the importance of some arrangement which shall leave us independant of that caprice, and free to maintain this treaty right without crossing the Atlantic to seek redress. for the present it is the interest of every part of our republic to cherish peace, and await a friendly rectification of the injury: and I have no doubt that seeing our present situation in a true point of view, you will concur in inculcating a reliance that the government will not be wanting in a just interference to preserve the rights of the nation. the uncertainty with what power we may have to settle this matter adds to it’s difficulties.     I take the liberty of inclosing you a copy of my communication to Congress, &amp; of tendering you assurances of my great respect and consideration.

trufl therefore, that it will be as promptly re- .

our pre fe nt fituation in a true point of view,

Your sum of November 30, has been i

the subject osit, was calculateu to give

of it was received here from N. Orleans .,

were immediately put in motion tcr duty  
impresiirtg him with the foote-quencee ot

took to remonﬂrate to him against it, and

It has turnished, however, a proper oc.

clufive that it was not the confequence of any |

that the prohibition was unauthorized, undeg­  
took immediately to difpatch a letter to the  
governor general who refides at the Havanna,  
to interpole cflicacioufly, and without delay.  
We truft therefore, that it will be as promptly

ed Kowevera proper occafion of urging on Spain
