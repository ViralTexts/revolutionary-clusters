nse of the Continent as exactly as any of them. I accordingly drew the Report which was accepted first by the Sub Committee then by the general Committee and last of all by Congress. The Declaration and Resolves you will find in the same Volume, Page 27. on Fryday October 14. 1774. They contain all the solid Principles which nearly two years afterwards were inserted in the Declaration of Independence. In these Resolves you will find many of my Principles of Revolution, particularly the fifth and sixth which were at that time Principles of every Member of Congress and of the whole Continent.  
The fifth Resolve is, “That the respective Colonies are entitled to the Common Law of England and more especially to the great and inestimable Priviledge of being tried by their Peers of the Vicarage, according to the Course of that Law.  
The Sixth Resolve is “That they are entitled to the Benefit of such of the English Statutes, as existed at the time of their Colonization and which they have be Experience, respectively found to be applicable to their several local and other Circumstances.  
The Tenth Resolve is “It is indispensibly necessary to good Government and rendered essential by the English Constitution, that the Constiuent Branches of the Legislature be independent of each other.”

he dreaded and abhorred Republican Governments.  
The first Appearance of a national Stipulation in favour of Republican Government was in the Constitution of the United States, in which a Republican Constitution was guarranteed to the Several States. It may perhaps be a Sufficient Recommendation of this Article to say that it was introduced by Mr Charles Pinkney of South Carolina, and he ought to have the Glory of it. But I confess I never understood it, and I believe no other Man ever did or ever will. A Republican Government is a Government of more than one. The Word Republick has been used, it is true by learned Men to Signify every actual and every possible Government among Men, that of Constantinople as well as that of Geneva. But the most accurate Writers distinguish Republicks from Despotisms and Simple Monarchies, and call every Government by that name in which more than one Person is concerned in the Sovereignty, and in this Sense the Kingdoms of Sparta Poland and England were Republicks as truely as Saint Marino. Venice Holland and other States were universally called Republicks both by the Learned and unlearned; yet the People in these States had certainly no more Liberty than those of England or France. The most Accurate distinction then has been between free Republicks and Republicks which are not free. It is not even said in our Constitution that the People shall be guarranteed in a Free Republican Government. The Word is So loose and indeffinite that Successive Predominant Factions will put Glosses and Constructions upon it as different as light and darkness, and if ever there should be a Civil War which Heaven forbid, the conquering General in all his Tryumphs may establish a Military Despotism and yet call it a constitutional Republic as Napoleon has already Set him the Example. The only Effect of it that I could ever See, is to deceive the People: and this practice my heart abhors my head disapproves, and my Tongue my Pen have  ever avoided. I am No Pharisee, Jesuit or Macchiavilian.

olina, aud he ought to have the glory of  
it. But I confess that I never under­  
stood it, and I behoved no other man  
ever did or ever will. A republican  
government a government more than  
one. The word republic has been used  
it is true, by learned men to signify  
every actual aud every possible govern­  
ment among men, that of Constantino­  
ple as well as that of Geneva. But tho  
most acurate writers distinguished re­  
•  
pub licks from despotisms and simple  
monarchies, and call every government  
by that name in which more than one  
person is concerned in the sovereignty,  
and in this sense tbs kingdom of Sparta,  
Poland aud England were republicks  
as truly as Saint Marino. Venice, Hol­  
land and other States were universally  
called repi blicks, both by the learned  
aud unlearned; yet the people in these  
States had certainly no more liberty  
than those of England and France. The  
most accurate distinction then has been  
between free republicks which are not  
free. It is not even said in our consti­  
tution that the people shall be guaran­  
teed in a free republican government.  
The word is so looet and indefinite that  
successive predominant factions will put  
glosses and constructions upon it as dif­  
ferent as light and darkness, and if ever  
there should be a civil war, which Heav­  
en forbid, the conquering General, in  
all his triumphs, may establish a military  
despotism and yet call it a constitutional  
republic, as Napoleon has already set  
him the example. The only effect of it  
that I could ever see is to deceive the  
people; and this practice my heart ab­  
hors, my head disapprovosand my pen  
have ever avoided. I am no Pharise ■,  
suit or Maoehiavilian.
