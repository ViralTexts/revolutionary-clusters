Caller’s certificate? Sir, I think the pirates are not so detestable as the wicked judge who robs a man of his time in attending courts and spending money, and keeping him in suspense for fourteen years, by delaying and denying him justice.

The next ten years of Spenser’s life brought no  
new literary work of importance, but at their close  
we find him removed from the Court, the friend-  
ship of Sidney, and the patronage of Leicester,  
and settled in Ireland. That his Court experience  
had been a trying one, we infer from these forcible  
lines in Mother Hubbard’s Tale :  
  
“ Full little knowest thou that hast not tried,  
What hell it is in suing long to bide ;  
To lose good days that might be better spent,  
To waste long nights in pensive discontent ;  
To speed to-day, to be put back to-morrow;  
To feed on hope, to pine with fear and sorrow ;  
To have thy prince’s grace, yet want her peers’;  
To have thy asking, yet wait many years;  
To fret thy soul with crosses and with cares;  
To eat thy heart through comfortless despair ;
