I sincerely rejoice that you are so. yours is one of the few lives precious to mankind, &amp; for the continuance of which every thinking man is solicitous. bigots may be an exception. what an effort, my dear Sir, of bigotry in Politics &amp; Religion have we gone through. the barbarians really flattered themselves they should even be able to bring back the times of Vandalism, when ignorance put every thing into the hands of power &amp; priestcraft. all advances in science were proscribed as innovations. they pretended to praise &amp; encourage education, but it was to be vain the education of our ancestors. we were to look backwards not forwards for improvement, the President himself declaring in one of his answers to addresses that we were never to expect to go beyond them in real science. this was the real ground of all the attacks on you: those who live by mystery &amp; charlatanerie, fearing you would render them useless by simplifying the Christian philosophy, the most sublime &amp; benevolent, but most perverted system that ever shone on man, endeavored to crush your well earnt, &amp; well deserved fame. but it was the Lilliputians upon Gulliver. our countrymen have recovered from the alarm into which art &amp; industry had thrown them, science &amp; honesty are replaced on their high ground, and you, my dear Sir, as their great apostle, are on it’s pinnacle. it is with heartfelt satisfaction that, in the first moment of my public action, I can hail you with welcome to our land, tender to  you the homage of it’s respect &amp; esteem, cover you under the protection of those laws which were made for the wise &amp; the good like you, and disclaim the legitimacy of that libel on legislation which under the form of a law was for sometime placed among them. as the storm is now subsiding &amp; the horison becoming serene, it is pleasant to consider the phaenomenon with attention. we can no longer say there is nothing new under the sun. for this whole chapter in the history of man is new. the great extent of our republic is new. it’s sparse habitation is new. the mighty wave of public opinion which has rolled over it is new. but the most pleasing novelty is it’s so quickly subsiding, over such an extent of surface, to it’s true level again. the order &amp; good sense displayed in this recovery from delusion, and in the momentous crisis which lately arose, really bespeak a strength of character in our nation which augurs well for the duration of our republic, &amp; I am much better satisfied now of it’s stability, than I was before it was tried. I have been above all things solaced by the prospect which opened on us in the event of a non election of a president; in which case the federal government would have been in the situation of a clock or watch run down. there was no idea of force, nor of any occasion for it. a Convention, invited by the republican members of Congress with the virtual President &amp; Vice President, would have been on the ground in 8. weeks, would have repaired the constitution where it was defective &amp; wound it up again. this peaceable &amp; legitimate resource, to which we are in the habit of implicit obedience, superseding all appeal to force, and being always within our reach, shews a precious principle of self-preservation in our composition, till a change of circumstances shall take place, which is not within prospect at any definite period

“What an effort, my dear sir, of bigotry in po­  
litics ami religion have we gone through! The  
barbarians really flattered themselves they should  
be able to biing back tlu- times of Vandalism,  
when ignorance put every thing into the hands  
ol power and priesicraf.. All advances in sci­  
ence were proscribed as innovations; they pre­  
tended to praise and encourage education, but it  
was to be the education of our ancestors; we  
were to look backwards, not forwards, for im­  
provement; the President himself declaring,  
in one of his answers to addresses, that&#x27;we were  
never to expect to go beyond them in real sci­  
ence. This was the real ground of all their at­  
tack upon you: Those who live by mystery  
and charlatanerie, fearing you would render  
them useless by simplifying the Christian phtlo­  
phiy, the piost sublime and benevolent, but the  
most perverted system that ever shone on man,  
endeavoring to crush your well-earned and well­  
deserving fame: but it was the Lilliputians up­  
on fiulliver. Our countrymen have recovered  
from the alarm into which art and industry  
had thrown them; science and honesty are re­  
placed on their high ground, and you, my dear  
sir, as their great apostle, are on its pinnacle.  
It is with heart felt satisfaction, that in the first  
moment of my public action I can hail you with  
welcome to our land, tender you jhe homage of  
its respect and esteem, cover you under the pro­  
tection nf those laws which were made for the  
wise and the good, like you, and disclaim the  
legitimacy of that libel on legislation, which,  
under the form of a law, was for some time  
placed among them. As the storm is now sub­  
siding, and the horizon becoming serene, it is  
pleasant to consider the phenomenon with at­  
tention. We can no longer say there is nothing  
new under the sun; for this whole chapter in  
the history of man is new; the great extent of  
our republic is new; its sparse habitation is  
new; the mightv wave ol public opinion, which  
has rolled over it; is new; but the most pleasing  
novelty is its so quickly subsiding, over such an  
extent of surface, to its true level again. The  
order and good sense displayed in this recove­  
ry from delusion, and in the momentous crisis  
which lately arose, really bespeak a strength of  
character in our nation which augurs well for  
ihe duration of our republic. I have been, above  
all things, solaced by the prospect which open­  
ed upon us in the event of a non-election.of a  
President; in which case, the federal govern­  
ment would have been in the situation of a clock  
or watch run down; there was no idea of force,  
nor of any occasion for it. A convention, invi­  
ted by the republican members of Congress,  
with the virtual President and Vice President,

was defective, and wound it up again.”
