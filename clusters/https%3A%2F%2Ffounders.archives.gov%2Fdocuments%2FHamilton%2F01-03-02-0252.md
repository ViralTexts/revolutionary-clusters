deration.  
  
By the 4th. clause of the 6th article it is declared that “no vessels of war shall be kept up by any state in time of peace, except such number only as shall be deemed necessary by the United States in Congress assembled, for the defence of such state or its trade; nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any state in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgment of the United States in Congress assembled shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defence of such state.”  
By the 5th. clause of the 9th article, The United States in Congress assembled are empowered generally (and without mention of peace or war) “to build and equip a navy, to agree upon the number of land forces, and to make requisitions from each state for its quota, in proportion to the number of white inhabitants in each state, which requisition shall be binding, and thereupon the legislature of each state, shall appoint the Regimental officers, raise the men and clothe arm and equip them in a soldier-like manner at the expence of the United States and the officers and men so cloathed armed and equipped shall march to the place appointed and within the time agreed on by the United States in Congress assembled.”  
By the 4th. clause of the same article the United States are empowered “to appoint all officers of the land forces except regimental officers, to appoint all officers of the naval forces, and to commission all officers whatever in the service of the United States, making rules for the government and regulation of the said land and naval forces and directing their operations.”  
It appears to the Committee that the terms of the first clause are rather restrictive on the particular states than directory to the United States, intended to prevent any state from keeping up forces land or naval without the approbation and sanction of the Union, which might endanger its tranquillity and harmony, and not to contravene the positive power vested in the United States by the subsequent clauses, or to deprive them of the right of taking such precautions as should appear to them essential to the general security. A distinction that this is to be provided for in time of war, by the forces of the Union, in time of peace, by those of each state would involve, besides other inconveniences, this capital one, that when the forces of the Union should become necessary to defend its rights and repel any attacks upon them, the United States would be obliged to begin to create at the very moment they would have occasion to employ a fleet and army. They must wait for an actual commencement of hostilities before they would be authorised to prepare for defence, to raise a single regiment or to build a single ship. When it is considered what a length of time is requisite to levy and form an army and still more to build and equip a navy, which is evidently a work of leisure and of peace requiring a gradual preparation of the means—there cannot be presumed so improvident an intention in the Confederation as that of obliging the United States to suspend all provision for the common defence ’till a declaration of war or an invasion. If this is admitted it will follow that they are at liberty to make such establishments in time of peace as they shall judge requisite to the common safety. This is a principle of so much importance in the apprehension of the Committee to the welfare of the union, that if any doubt should exist as to the true meaning of the first-mentioned clause, it will in their opinion be proper to admit such a construction as will leave the general power, vested in the United States by the other clauses, in full force; unless the states respectively or a Majority of them shall declare a different interpretation. The Committee however submit to Congress, (in conformity to that spirit of Candour and to that respect for the sense of their constituents, which ought ever to characterize their proceedings) the propriety of transmitting the plan which they may adopt to the several states to afford an opportunity of signifying their sentiments previous to its final execution.  
The Committee, are of opinion, if there is a contitutional power in the United States for that purpose, that there are conclusive reasons in favour of fœderal in preference to state establishments.  
First there are objects for which separate provision cannot conveniently be made; posts within certain districts, the judisdiction and property of which are not yet constitutionally ascertained—territory appertaining to the United States not within the original claim of any of the states—the navigation of the Missippi and of the lakes—the rights of the fisheries and of foreign commerce; all which belonging to the United States depending on the laws of nations and on treaty, demand the joint protection of the Union, and cannot with propriety be trusted to separate establishments.  
Secondly, the fortifications proper to be established ought to be constructed with relation to each other on a general and well-digested system and their defence should be calculated on the same principles. This is equally important in the double view of safety and œconomy. If this is not done under the direction of the United States, each state following a partial and disjointed plan, it will be found that the posts will have no mutual dependence or support—that they will be improperly distributed, and more numerous than is necessary as well as less efficacious—of course more easily reduced and more expensive both in the construction and defence.  
3dly. It happens, that from local circumstances particular states, if left to take care of themselves, would be in possession of the chief part of the standing forces and of the principal fortified places of the union; a circumstance inconvenient to them and to the United States—to them, because it would impose a heavy exclusive burthen in a matter the benefit of which will be immediately shared by their neighbours and ultimately by the states at large—to the United States, because it confides the care of the safety of the whole to a part, which will naturally be unwilling as well as unable to make such effectual provision at its particular expence, as the common welfare requires—because a single state from the peculiarity of its situation, will in a manner keep the keys of the United States—because in fiine a considerable force in the hands of a few states may have an unfriendly aspect on the confidence and harmony which ought carefully to be maintained between the whole.  
4thly. It is probable that a provision by the ⟨Congress⟩ of the forces necessary to be kept up will ⟨be based⟩ upon a more systematic and œconomical plan than a provision by the states separately; especially as it will be of importance as soon as the situation of affairs will permit, to establish founderies, manufactaries of arms, powder &amp;c; by means of which the labour of a part of the troops applied to this purpose will furnish the United States with those essential articles on easy terms, and contribute to their own support.  
5thly. There must be a corps of Artillery and Engineers kept on foot in time of peace, as the officers of this corps require science and long preliminary study, and cannot be formed on an emergency; and as the neglect of this institution would always oblige the United States to have recourse to foreigners in time of war for a supply of officers in this essential branch—an inconvenience which it ought to be the object of every nation to avoid. Nor indeed is it possible to dispense with the service of such a corps in time of peace, as it will be indispensable not only to have posts on the frontier; but to have fortified harbours for the reception and protection of the fleet of the United States. This corps requiring particular institutions for the instruction and formation of the officers cannot exist upon separate establishments without a great increase of expence.  
6thly. It appears from the annexed papers No. 1 to 4, to be the concurrent opinion of the Commander in Chief, the Secretary at War, the Inspector General and the Chief Engineer, not only that some militia establishment is indispensable but that it ought in all respects to be under the authority of the United States as well for military as political reasons. The plan hereafter submitted on considerations of œconomy is less extensive than proposed by either of them.  
  
The Committee upon these principles submit the following plan.  
The Military peace establishment of the United States to consist of four regiments of infantry, and, one of Artillery incorporated in a corps of Engineers, with the denomination of the corps of Engineers.  
Each Regiment of infantry to consist of two batalions, each batalion of four companies, each company of 64 rank and file, with the following, commissioned and Non commissioned officers, pay, rations and cloathing; to be however recruited to one hundred &amp; twenty eight rank &amp; file in time of war, preserving the proportion of corporals to privates.

se its pay is the lowest; and because the having served in these offices will better qualify officers for the superior stations. It is necessary to have an extra number of officers for these purposes because three officers to a company so large as is here proposed are not more than sufficient and none can be taken away without injury to the service; and there is besides an obvious propriety that whatever number of officers may be deemed necessary to command a company should serve in it and none be detached for any other purpose. It may be remarked here that the companies are large which will have two good effects; it will promote œconomy by having a smaller proportion of officers to a given number of men and it will render their commands more respectable.  
  
C    It is to be desired that each batalion should be as complete in itself as possible in case of one being detached from the other; and as the batalions are large one of each of these inferior staff to a batalion will find full employment.  
D    The proportion of corporals will be as 1 to 7—this will be found beneficial in several ways—the number of corporals who from the mere circumstance of being distinguished from the others, having a better opinion of themselves will of course be better soldiers and being mixed with the others will render the whole better. Every seven men also being put constantly under the direction of a particular corporal to be answerable for the good behaviour of his squad will have a happy influence on discipline and good orde

The idea of the confederation being adhered to, the number of troops to be raised must be distributed to the several states according to the proportion of their respective populations; and each must appoint Regimental officers in proportion to the number of men it furnishes; but as no state will have to furnish a complete regiment this apportionment of the officers will become extremely difficult, if not impracticable on any satisfactory footing, and the filling up vacancies as they arise will create endless perplexity. It would be much to be preferred that the states could be induced to transfer this right to Congress and indeed without it, there can never be regularity in the military system; it would also be much the best that the men should be inlisted under Continental direction, which will be a more certain and more frugal mode; for if it is to be done by the particular states, they will raise the price of the men by competition, and the United States will be obliged to pay for any mismanagement or extravagance which may happen though without their participation or controul.  
The officers however to command the different corps in the first instance may with propriety be reserved out of those now in service who are willing to continue in the military line; provided that such as are retained shall not be intitled to the half pay for their services during the war.  
All promotions to be made Regimentally to the rank of Major inclusively according to seniority; and from that rank upwards, in the line of the army, according to the same rule; the officers of dragoons and infantry rolling together without distinction of corps.  
The promotion in the Engineers to be distinct and according to seniority in that corps.  
Provided that no officer whatsoever shall consider it as a violation of his rights, if another receives an extra promotion in the corps on account of brilliant services or peculiar talents.  
And in order that such extra-promotion may not depend on misrepresentation, it shall not be made but on the recommendation of the Commander of the army, accompanied by the facts and reasons upon which it is founded, and with the opinion of the officer commanding the corps in which the promotion is to be made, all which shall be reported to Congress, by the secretary at war with his opinion concerning the same.  
All non commissioned officers and privates to be engaged for six years; with this condition that if a war should break out during the time, they shall be obliged to serve to the end of it.  
Fortifications  
The fortifications necessary to be kept up are of two kinds, land and naval; the first for internal security the last for the protection of the fleets of the United States.  
As to the first kind, there are many important posts already existing, several of which it will be essential to occupy and guard ’till more perm

eneral plan. For this Congress have already made temporary provision by their resolution of the . If the time therein limited should be likely to expire before a general system can be adopted, it can be prolonged.  
The Committee are of opinion that the principles laid down by Major General Du Portail, Chief Engineer, in the memorial annexed to this report, so far as they respect merely the article of fortifications are in general sound and just; and that it will be expedient for Congress, so soon as they have determined on the establishment of the corps of Engineers, to instruct the head of that corps to make a survey of the points proper to be fortified and to digest a general plan proportioned to the military establishment of the United States to be laid before Congress for their consideration.  
  
Arsenals and Magazines  
The Committee are of opinion that it will be proper for Congress to keep constantly on foot Arsenals and magazines of such articles as are not of a perishable nature, in different parts of the United States equal to the complete equipment of thirty thousand men, for the field or for a seige calculated on a three years supply; and that in this view it will be proper to select the following places of deposit: Springfield in the State of Massachusettes; West Point &amp; its dependencies, State of New York; Carlisle, State of Pensylvania; Some convenient position on James River to be reconnoitered for that purpose; Cambden State of South Carolina.  
All the artillery and military stores in the possession of the United States to be distributed to these deposits in equal proportions, and as soon as may be deficiencies in the proposed quantity to be made up; so that each deposit may suffice for six thousand men.  
Military Academies  
The Committee are of opinion that the benefit of such institutions rarely compensates for the expence—that military knowlege is best acquired in service, that with respect to those branches of service which are of a more scientific nature, the professors proposed to be attached to the corps of Engineers, will produce substantially all the utility to be expected from academies—that at all events institutions of this kind can only be an object of future consideration.  
Founderies and Manufactories  
The Committee are of opinion that as soon as the situation of public affairs will permit, it ought to be a serious object of our policy to be able to supply ourselves with all articles of first necessity in war, and in this view to establish founderies of cannon, manufactories of arms, powder &amp;c.  
There are two reasons which appear to them conclusive for this; the first that every country ought to endeavour to have within itself all the means essential to its own preservation, as to depend on the casualties of foreign supplies is to render its own security precarious. The second that as it will be indispensable to keep up a corps of Artillery and some other troops, the labour of a part of these bestowed upon the manufactories will enable the public to supply itself on better and cheaper terms than by importation. The Committee propose that the Secretary at war be directed to lay before Congress a plan in detail for this purpose designating the places where those founderies and manufactories can be erected with advantage—the means to be employed and the expence to be incurred in the execution.  
General Staff  
The Committee are of opinion that a general staff in time of peace (except a General officer to command the troops another to command the corps of Engineers and Artillery and an Inspector General) ought to be dispensed with as all the purposes may be answered by the war department, by contracts, and by the Regimental staff.  
The pay of the officers here mentioned and other emoluments to be as follows  
  
  
  
Pay per Month Dollars  
Rations per day  
Rations forage ⅌ day

In time of war two Regiments to compose a Brigade and a Brigadier General to be appointed to each brigade with 200 dollars pay per Month and 5 rations of forage per day.

A general hospital for the reception of the invalids of the army and navy will be necessary to consist for the present of the following persons:

G    The Committee are of opinion that this expence is necessary and that the only question is whether it shall be borne by the United States or by particular states; in which last case it is probable it will be increased for want of general system. The considerations already stated leave no doubt with the Committee in what manner the question ought to be decided.  
Militia  
The Committee are also of opinion that in considering the means of national defence, Congress ought not to overlook that of a well regulated militia; that as the keeping up such a militia and proper arsenals and magazines by each state is made a part of the confederation, the attention of Congress to this object becomes a constitutional duty; that as great advantages would result from uniformity in this article in every state, and from the militia establishment being as similar as the nature of the case will admit to that of the Continental forces, it will be proper for Congress to adopt and recommend a plan for this purpose.  
The Committee submit the following outlines of such a plan which if thought necessary may be digested and improved.  
  
All the free male inhabitants in each state from 20 to fifty, except such as the laws of the state shall exempt, to be divided into two general classes; one class to consist of married the other class of single men.  
Each class to be formed into corps of infantry and dragoons, organised in the same manner as proposed for the regular troops.  
Those who are willing to be at the expence of equipping themselves for dragoon service to be permitted to enter into that corps, the residue to be formed into infantry. This will consult the convenience and inclinations of different classes of citizens.  
Each officer of the dragoons to provide himself with a horse saddle &amp;c. pistols and sabre, and each non commissioned officer and private with the preceding articles and these in addition, a carbine and cartouch box, with twelve rounds of powder &amp; ball for his carbine and six for each pistol.  
Each officer of the infantry to have a sword and each non commissioned officer and private, a musket, bayonet &amp; cartouch box with twelve rounds of powder and ball.  
The corps of single men to be obliged to assemble for inspection and exercise once in two months by companies and once in four months regimentally; to be subject to proper penalties in case of delinquency.  
The corps of married men to be obliged to assemble for the same purpose &amp; subject to like penalties once in three months by companies and once in six months regimentally.  
When the state itself is invaded, the corps of either class indifferently to be obliged to take the field for its defence, and to remain in service one year; unless sooner relieved by special order.  
When another state is attacked and it is necessary to march to its succour, one half of all the corps of single men shall be obliged to take their tour of duty first and to serve for the same period—to be succeeded for a like period by one half of all the corps of married men; and then alternately.  
In addition to these two classes there shall be a third under a particular denomination as fencibles, fusileers, train bands or whatever else may be thought proper, with the same organization as the infantry of the other classes but composed as follows:  
  
Of all such of either of the two other classes inhabiting cities or incorporated towns as will voluntarily engage to serve for the term of Eight years, provided they shall not exceed the proportion of one to fifty of all the enrolled militia of the state, and provided that if a war breaks out they shall be obliged to serve three years after they take the field and to march wherever the service may require.  
The conditions on the part of the public to be these: each non commissioned officer and soldier to be furnished with a musket bayonet and cartouch box, and every two years with a suit of uniform, consisting of a coat jacket and breeches of cloth; the arms and accoutrements to become his property at the end of his time of service.  
These corps to be obliged to assemble Regimentally once a month, for exercise and inspection, with a power in the officer commanding each company to assemble his company once in the interval of each Regimental assembling the better to perfect them in the exercise; the non commissioned officers and privates to be intitled to 1/12 of a dollar for each day of assembling.  
The officers of this corps to have equality of rank with the officers of the army, and to take precedency of the officers of the militia, that is every officer of the train bands shall command every officer of the two other classes of equal grade without regard to date of commission. This preference will induce proper persons to accept commissions in the train bands, and be at the extra trouble which that service will require.  
Any of the militia when in service to be intitled to the same emoluments as the regular troops—or in lieu of cloathing to the two first classes to the addition of one dollar ⅌ Month of pay.  
The Committee are of opinion that with a view to either of the proposed establishments, it will be proper to direct the Commander in Chief to appoint a board of officers, the Inspector General, Commandant of Artillery and Chief Engineer being members, to revise the regulations for the army of the United States, and to digest a general ordinance for the service of all the troops of the United States, and another for the service of the militia; and to transmit both with his observations to Congress for their consideration; the latter when approved to be recommended to the several states.  
  
The expence of the Militia establishment will amount to about 60,000 dollars ⅌ annum a sum which may be nearly defrayed out of the militia fines if properly managed.  
The present population will afford about 8000 of the 3d. Class.

ion is conducive to œconomy. There is an extra number to serve as Engineers.  
B.    The pay of this corps is generally higher than of any other; because there is much preparatory study and labour to qualify an officer, and promotion is much less rapid.  
C.    There are a great number of officers in proportion to the men; because artillery are chiefly in detachments &amp; are of so much consequence in military operations that the pieces ought rarely to be trusted to non commissioned officers.  
D.    These professors are indispensable for the instruction of the officers, the pay is considerable to induce able men to engage.  
E.    There are fewer non Commissioned staff than in the infantry because when the corps is united fewer will answer &amp; when divided it is so much divided, that sergeants must do their duties on the detachments.  
F.    The allowance of cloathing is less than it has heretofore been, a suit of uniform being allowed only once in two years; but this is as much as is done in the European armies in general and is sufficient.  
G.    The expence may be still further diminished by raising only two regiments and those full which will give the same number of men as this reduction of the 4; but the United States will by this means have too small a number of officers; and should a war take place they will be intirely at a loss to officer properly the additional forces.  
It is to be remarked that in the calculation of expence in every case, there ought to be a deduction of the half pay of the officers retained in service; which ought to be considered as lowering the expence of the military establishment during the lives of the present set of officers which upon an average may be estimated at twenty five years.  
This makes the difference between the expence of 4 Regiments of officers or of two much less considerable than it appears at first sight and is an additional reason for that consideration not being put in competition with the national utility of keeping them in servic

dour, and to that refpe&amp; for the fenfe —  
_ of their conftituenss, which ought

ings) the propriety of tranfmitting the  
‘plan which they may adopt to the  
feveral States, ta afford an opportn-  
nity of fignifying their fentiments,  
previous toits Gnal execution, .  
  
The committee are of pinion, if  
there is.a confiitutional power in the  
UWhited Staies for that purpofe, that  
there are gpnclufive reafens in favour  
of fcedral, in preference to State effa-

Fir, There are obje&amp;s for which.  
feparate provifion cannot canveni-  
ently be made---pofts within certain  
diftrifis,the jurifdidiion and property  
of which are not yet conftitutionally  
afcertained, territory appertaining to

eripinal clainy of any of the Statés---

on treaty, demand the join: prote@i-  
on of the wnion, and ¢cafhnot, with  
propriety, Be trufied to  feperate  
eftabh fiments.  
  
Secondly, The fortifications proper  
to be eftabhfhed, ought to con-  
firatied with retition to each other,  
©b a generatard. well digefed fyftem ;  
andthen, defeute fhanid be calculated»  
on the {ame principles. This is équal-  
ly important in the double view of  
fafety and cecaonomy. If this isnot  
done under the direAjon of the United  
States, each Sratéfoliowmng a partial  
aod disjointed plan,it will be found  
  
that the pofts will have no mutual de-  
  
pendence or fupport, that they will  
be improperly diftributed, and more  
numerous than is neceffary, as well ap  
Je(s efficacious--of courfe more eafily  
redaced, and more expenfive both in  
the corfiruGisn and defence.  
Thirdiy, Tt happens, thar from lo-  
Cal circumftances, particulay States,  
if left te take care of themfelves,  
weuld be in voffedtion of the chief  
  
part of the ftanding forces, and of the  
principal fortified places of the union;  
acircumftance inconvenient to them,  
and to the United States ; to them,  
becaufe it would impofe a heavy. ex.  
clufive burthen in a matter, the be-  
nefit of which will be immediately  
fhared by their neghbours, and ul.  
timately by the States at.large- to  
the Unired States, becaufe it confides  
the care of fafety of the whole toa  
part which will naturally be unwill-  
ing, as well as unable to. make fuch  
efre€tual provifion at its particular  
expénce, as the common welfare re-  
quires -becaufea fingle State from the  
  
‘peculiarity of its ficuation, wil! in 3  
  
manner keep the keys of the United  
States--becaufe in fine,.2 confiderable  
force ig the hands of a few States»may  
have an unfriendly afpect on the con-  
fidence and harmony which ought  
Carefully. to. be maintaired betweeq  
the whole: |  
  
Fourthly, Itis probable that a pro-  
vifion by the United States of the  
forces neceffary to be kept up, will  
he made upon amore {yftematic and  
ceconomical plan, than a provifion by  
the States feperately, efpecially as it  
will be of importance as foon as the  
fituation of affairs wil permit, to ef-  
tablifh founderies, manufaGories of  
arms, powder, 2c. by means of which  
the labour of a port of the troops ap-  
  
lied to this purpofe, will furnifh the  
Gaited States with thofe effential ar-  
ticles on eafy terms, and contribute  
to their own fupport.  
  
Fifthly, There mufi_ be a corps of  
artillery and engineers kept on foot  
in time of peace---as the officers of  
this corps require fcience and long  
sins pe Rudy, and cannot be  
ormed on an emergency+-+-and as  
the negle@ of this infitution would  
always oblige the United States to  
have recourfe to foreigners in time of  
war, for a fupply of officers in this  
efiential branch, an wiconvenience  
which it ought to be the object of eve  
ty nation to avoid .-gor indeed is it  
poffible to difpenfe with the fervice  
of foch a corps in time of peace, as  
it will be indifpeofible, not only to  
have pofis on the frontiers, but to  
have fortihed harbours for the re-  
ception and prorettion of the fleet of  
the United States. This corps re-

isan extra Number fo ferve as engi-  
néeers,. : . ‘ ; ;  
  
The, pay of this corps is generally  
higher thay of any other becaulé there  
18 mach prepayatary fludy aadfabgur  
to qualify an pray rs and promotion  
is much lefs rapid. —  
  
C. There,are.a great numbers of  
officers in proportian to the men;  
becaufe the artillery are chiefly in de-  
tachments, and are of fo much confe-  
quence in .military operations, that  
the pieces ought rarély to be trufled  
to non commiffioned officers.  
  
D... Thefe five profeffors are indif-  
penfable for the ifftru@ion of the  
officers; the pay is confiderable, to  
induce able men to engage.  
  
- BE. There. are fewer noncommifii-  
oned fiaff-than in the infantry, be-  
caufe when the corps is united, fewer  
will anfwer, and when divided it is  
fo much.divided.that ferjeants muft  
do their duties on the detachments.  
  
The allowance of cloathing is Jefs  
than it has heretofore beep, a fuit of  
uniform being allowed only once in  
two years; but thisisas much as is  
  
done in the “European armies in  
general, and is fofficienit.  
  
The Me peer may be fill forthe?  
diminifhed, by raifing only two regi-  
ments, and thofe full, which will give  
the fame number of men as this redoc-  
tion of the four; bar the United States  
will by this means have foo fmiall  
a number of officere; and Moulda  
war take place, they will be entirely at  
a fofs to officer properly thé additions  
al’ forces: ~ . &#x27;  
  
It is to be remarked, thatin the  
calculation of in every cafe,  
there ought to be adedo@ion of the  
half-pay of the officers retained in fer-  
vice; which ought to be confidered  
as lowering the expence of the mili-  
tary eftablifhment during the lives of  
the prefent fet of officers, whith, up-  
on an average, may be eftimated at  
twenty-five years. ;  
  
This makes the difference bet ween  
the expence of four regimente of offi  
cers, or of two, mucir lefs confider-  
able than it appears at firft fight, and

by their refoivtion of the If the  
time therein |imited fhoald bé Jikely  
to expire betore 2 general fy ftem caa  
ve adopted, it can he prolonged.  
  
The Committee are of op:nion that  
the principies laid down by Major  
General Du Portail, Chief Engineer,in  
the memorial annexed (o this report,  
fo far as they refpet{ merely the artt-  
cles of fortifications, are in generat  
found and juft 3 and that it will be  
expedient for €ongrefs fo foon as  
they nave determmed on the eftab-  
hihment of the carps of engineers,  
to inftrutt the head of that corps to  
make a furvey of the pots proper  
to be fortified ; and to digef a gene-  
ral plan, proportioned tothe military  
efiabiifiment of the United States, to  
be jaid before Congrefs for tneir con-  
fderation.  
  
ARSENALS and MAGAZINES.  
  
The committee are of upinion tnat  
4t will be proper for Congrets to keep  
conftantly on.foot Arfenats and Ma-  
gaz:nes of {uch arfticies as are not of a  
perihable natore, in different parts  
of the United States, equal to the com-  
plete equipment of thirty thoufand  
men, for the field or for a fiege, cal-  
culatedon a three years fupply ; and  
thattn this view it will be proper to  
fele&amp; the following places of depofit :  
  
Springfield, in the State of Maffa-  
chufetts, Weft Point, and its depen-  
dencies, State of New-York. Carslifle,  
State of Pennfylvania. Some conve-  
hient pofition on James River, to be  
reconnaiered for that purpofe.  
Cambden, State-of South Carolina.  
  
All the artillery and military flores  
in the pofjeffion.of the United States  
to be difttibuted to thefe desofits in  
equal pro,ortions; and as foon as may  
be, deficicacies in the propofed quan-  
tity to be made up, fo tharc each de-  
  
pofit may fuffice for fixthoufand men,  
MILITARY ACADEMIES.  
The committee are of opiaion, that  
the teneft of (uch inftitutions rarely  
compenfate for the expence---that  
military knowledge is beft acquired ia  
fervice ---that with refpe&amp; to thofe  
branches of fervicé which are of a  
more {cientific nature, the profef-  
fors propofed to be attached to the  
corps of engineess, will produce fub-  
  
Papers.  
  
fiantially ali tne utility to be expe&amp;ed  
  
from academies. At all events in-  
  
fitutions of this kind can only be an  
  
obye&amp; of future confideration .  
  
FOUNDRIES and MANUFAC.  
TORIES.  
  
The committee are of opinion, that  
as foon as the fituation of public af-  
furs will permit, it ought to be a fe-  
rioas obied of our policy, to be able  
tofupply ousfelves with all articles  
of the firft neceffity in war, and in  
this view to eflablifi foundries of  
cannon, manufatories of artns, &amp;c. —  
  
There are two reafoas which ap-  
pear to them conclufive for this: The  
firfi, that every Country ovght to en-  
deavour to have within itfelf allthe  
méanseffential to its own prefervati-  
on; as todepend on the cafualties of  
foie gn fupplies, is to render its own  
fecurity precarious. The fecend,  
that as it wil! be indifpenfable to keep  
up acorps of art. Nery and fome other  
troops, the jabour of a part of thefé  
beflowed upon the manufaGories, will  
enable the public to fupply itfelf on  
better and chéaper terms than by im-  
portation. The committee propofé  
that the fecretary at war be dire&amp;ed  
to lay before Congrefs a plan in de-  
tail for this purpofe, defignating the  
places where thofe foundries and  
manufafories can be eref&amp;ted with ad-  
vantage, thie means to be employed,  
and the expence to be incurred in the  
execution.  
  
GENERAL STAFF.  
  
The committee are of opinion, that  
a general ftaff in the time of peace  
(except a general officer to command  
the troops, another to command the  
corps of engineers and artillery, and  
an infpefor- general) ought to be dif-  
penfed with ; ag all the purpofes  
may be anfwered by the war depart-  
meat, by contrufs, and by the regi-  
mental ftaff. !

MILITIA.  
  
HE Committee are alfo of opini-  
  
on, thatio conficering the means  
of national defence, Congrefs ought  
not to overlook tnat of a weil regu-  
lated militia ; that asthe keeping up  
of fuch a miltia and proper arfenals  
and magaz nee by each State is mace  
part of the Coufederation, the atten-  
tion of Congrefs to this object becomes  
aconftitutional duty ; that as great  
advantages would refult from uni-  
formity inthis article in every State,  
and from the militia eftab!ihment  
being as fimilar as the narure of the  
cafe will admit to that of the cont:-  
nental forces, it will be proper fer  
Congrefs to adopt and recommenda  
plan for this purpofe.  
  
The Comm ttee fubmit the follow-  
ing outlines of fuch a plan, which, if  
thought neceflary, may be digefted  
and improved.  
  
All the free male inhabitants in  
each State rom twenty to fifty, ex-  
cept fuch asthe laws of the State fhail  
exempt,to be divided into two general  
clafles one cla(sto confift of married,  
the other clafs of fingle men. Euch  
Clafs to be formed in corps of infaatry  
and dragoons, org2n.zed in the fame  
manner as propofed for ihe regular  
troops. Thofe who are willing to be  
at the experce of equ’ pping themlelves  
for dragoon fervice to be permitted  
to enter into that Corps---the refidue  
to be formed into infantry ; this will  
confult the convenience and inclina-  
tions of different claffes of cititens.  
Each officer of the dragoons to pro-  
vide himfelf with a horfe, faddle, &amp;c.  
piflols and fabre, and ¢ach non-com-  
miffioned officer and private with the  
preceeding articles, and thefe in addi-  
tion, a carbine and cartouch-box,  
with twelve rounds of powder and  
ball for his carbine, and fix for each  
piftol. Each officer of the infantry  
to have a fword, and each non com-  
  
State Papers. 533  
  
miffioned officer and private a mufket,  
bayonet, and ca:touch box, with,  
twelve rcunds of powder. and ball,  
‘The corps of fingle men to be obliged  
to alfemble for infpeftion and exer-  
cife, once in two months by compas  
nies, and once in four months regte  
mentally ; to be fubjett to propeg  
penalties in cafe of delinquency, Tire  
corps of married men to be obliged  
to afiemble for the fame *purpofes,  
and fubjett to the like penalties, once  
in three months by compames, and  
once 10 fix months reg mentally.  
  
When the State irfet: isinvaded the  
corps of ether clafs iodifferentiy to  
be obliged to take the ficid. in its de-  
fence, and to remain ie fervice one  
year, unlefs fooner relieved by {peci-  
al order. When another Siate is at-  
tacked, and itss neceflary to march  
to its fuccour, one halt ofall the corps  
of fingle men fhall be obiiged tatake  
their tour of duty Arfi, and to ferve  
for the fame period,to be fucceed-  
ed for a like period by one half of all  
the corps of mdrried men, and thea  
alternately.  
  
In addition to thefe two claffes  
there thouid be a third, under a par-  
ticular denomination, as fencibles,  
fuzileers, train bands, er whatever  
elfe may be thought proper, with the  
fame orgapitation as the mfantry of  
the other ciaffes, but compofed as  
folows: Of all fuch of either of the  
two other clafies inhabiting cities, or  
incorporated towns, as will volun-  
tarily eng-geto ferve for the term  
of eight years; provided they thail  
not exceed the proportion of one to  
fifty of all the enrolled militia of the  
State, and provided that if a war  
breaks out, they fha!l be obliged to  
ferve three years after they take tie  
field, and to march wherever the  
fervice may require. The conditi-  
ons on the part wf the public to be

The Committee are of 2 opinion,  
that with a view to either of tke pro.  
pofed eftablifhments, it will be pro-  
per to direct the Commander in  
Chief to appoint a Board of Officers,  
the Infpetior General, Commandant  
of Artillery, and Chief Engineer, be-  
ing members, to revife the regula-  
tions of the army of the United States,  
aad to digeft a generai ordinance  
for the fervice of all the troops  
of the United States, and ano-  
ther for the fervice of the militia;  
and to tranfmit both, with his ob-  
fervations, to Congrefs, for their con-  
fideration---the latter, when approv-  
ed, to be recommended to the feve-  
ra! States.  
  
The expence of the Militia eftab-  
‘ifhment will amount to about 60,000  
dotlars per annum, a fum which may  
be nearly defrayed out of the Militia  
fines, if properly managed. The pre-  
fent population will afford about  
8000 of the third clafs.
