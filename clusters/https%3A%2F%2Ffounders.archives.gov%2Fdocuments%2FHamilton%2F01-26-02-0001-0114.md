New York September 161803  
My Dear Sir  
  
I will make no apology for my delay in answering your inquiry some time since made, because I could offer none which would satisfy myself. I pray you only to believe that it proceeded from any thing rather than want of respect or regard. I shall now comply with your request.  
The highest toned propositions, which I made in the Convention, were for a President, Senate and Judges during good behaviour—a house of representatives for three years. Though I would have enlarged the Legislative power of the General Government, yet I never contemplated the abolition of the State Governments; but on the contrary, they were, in some particulars, constituent parts of my plan.  
This plan was in my conception comformable with the strict theory of a Government purely republican; the essential criteria of which are that the principal organs of the Executive and Legislative departments be elected by the people and hold their offices by a responsible and temporary or defeasible tenure.  
A vote was taken on the proposition respecting the Executive. Five states were in favour of it; among those Virginia; and though from the manner of voting, by delegations, individuals were not distinguished, it was morally certain, from the known situation of the Virginia members (six in number, two of them Mason and Randolph possessing popular doctrines) that Madison must have concurred in the vote of Virginia. Thus, if I sinned against Republicanism, Mr. Madison was not less guilty.  
I may truly then say, that I never proposed either a President, or Senate for life, and that I neither recommended nor meditated the annihilation of the State Governments.  
And I may add, that in the course of the discussions in the Convention, neither the propositions thrown out for debate, nor even those voted in the earlier stages of deliberation were considered as evidences of a definitive opinion, in the proposer or voter. It appeared to me to be in some sort understood, that with a view to free investigation, experimental propositions might be made, which were to be received merely as suggestions for consideration.  
Accordingly, it is a fact, that my final opinion was against an Executive during good behaviour, on account of the increased danger to the public tranquil[i]ty incident to the election of a Magistrate of this degree of permanency. In the plan of a Constitution, which I drew up, while the convention was sitting &amp; which I communicated to Mr. Madison about the close of it, perhaps a day or two after, the Office of President has no greater duration than for three years.  
This plan was predicated upon these bases—1 That the political principles of the people of this country would endure nothing but republican Government. 2 That in the actual situation of the Country, it was in itself right and proper that the republican theory should have a fair and full trial—3 That to such a trial it was essential that the Government should be so constructed as to give it all the energy and stability reconciliable with the principles of that theory. These were the genuine sentiments of my heart, and upon them I acted.  
I sincerely hope, that it may not hereafter be discovered, that through want of sufficient attention to the last idea, the experiment of Republican Government, even in this Country, has not been as complete, as satisfactory and as decisive as could be wished.  
Very truly   Dear Sir Yr friend &amp; servt

New-York, Sept. 16, 1803.  
  
My prar str,—f wilh make no apology for my ce-  
lay in answering your enquiry scme time since made,  
because I could offer none which would satisty my-  
self——I pray you only to believe that it proceeded  
from any thing rather than want of respect or regatd  
—I shallnow comply with your request.  
  
The highest toned propositions which T made in  
the convention were for a president, senate and judg-  
es, during good behaviour ; a house of representa-  
tives for three vears. Though I would have enlarge cl  
the legislative power of the general government, yet  
J never contemplated the abolition of the state go-  
vernments ; but on the contrary, they Were, in some  
particulars, constituent parts of my plan.  
  
This plan was, in my conception, conformable with  
the strict theory of a government purely republican ,  
the essential criteria of which are, that the principa}  
organs of the executive and legislative departmeni:,  
be elected by the people, and hold the the ofices by  
a responsible anil temporary or dcfeasible nature  
  
A vote was taken on the proposition respectirg  
the executive. Five states were in favor of it; among  
these Virginia; and though from the manner of vot-  
ing by delegations, individuals were not distinguish-  
ed ; it was morally certain, from the Known situa-

to the election of a magistrate of his degree of per-  
manency. .In the place ofa constitution which 1}

This plan was predicated upon these bases :  
1. That the political principles of the people of

publican theory should have a fair and full trial—

I sincerely hope that it may not hereafter be disco-

the last idea, the experiment of republican govern-

as satisfactory, and as decisive, as could be wished.

The highest toned propositions, which I made in the conven-  
tion, were for a president, senate, and judges, during good beha-  
viour—a house of representatives for three years. ‘Though I  
would have enlarged the legislative power of the general govera-  
ment, yet [ never contemplated the abolition of the state govern-  
ments; but on the contrary, they were in some particulars, consti-  
tuent parts of my plan.  
  
This plan was in my conception, conformable with the strict  
theory of a government arto republican; the essential criteria  
of which are, that the principal organ of the executive and legis.  
lative departments be elected by the people, and hold their offices  
by a responsible and temporary, or defeasible tenure.  
  
A vote was taken on the proposition respecting the executive.  
Five states were in favour of it; among these Virginia, and though  
from the manner of voting, by delegations, individuals were not  
distinguished, it was morally certain, from the known situation of  
the Virginia members, (six in number, two of them Mason and  
Randolph, professing popular doctrines,) that Madison must have  
concurred in the vote of Virginia. ‘Thus, if I sinned against re-  
publicanism, Mr. Madison was not less guilty.  
  
I may truly then say, that I never proposed either a president  
or senate for lifé, and that I neither recommended nor meditated  
the annihilation of the state governments.  
  
And I may add, that in the course of the discussions in the  
convention, neither the propositions thrown out for debate, nor  
even those voted in the earlier stages of deliberation, were con-  
sidered as evidences of a definite opinion, in the proposer or voter.  
It appeared to me to be in some sort understood, that with a view  
to free investigation, experimental propositions might be made,  
which were to be received merely as suggestions for considera-  
tion.  
  
Accordingly, it is a fact, that my final opinion was against an  
executive during good behaviour, on account of the increased dan-  
ger to the public tranquillity, incident to the election of a magis-  
trate of this degree of permanency. In the plan of a constitution,  
which I drew up, while the convention was sitting, and which I  
communicated to Mr. Madison about the close of it, perhaps a  
a day or two after, the office of president has no greater duration  
than for three years.  
  
This plan was predicated upon these bases:—Ist. That the po-  
litical principles of the people of this country would endure noth-

AMILTON ON THE POWERS OP  
THE GOVERNMENT.  
It has often been intimated by politicians not  
familiar with the early history of the country that  
Gen. Alixandkr Hamilton was an advocate of a  
strong Government, and favored tjie idea of a Pre­  
sident for life. This imputation is occasionally re­  
peated with an air of confidence which gives it cre­  
dencc with the multitude. Hut. the charge was  
controverted in a positive manner more than fifty  
years ago by the distinguished statesman himself.  
A letter to Timotuv Pickering, first published in  
1812, is of sufficient interest to be reproduced at  
this time:  
New York, September 16, 1803.  
My Dear Sib: I &#x27;will make no apology for my delay  
in answering your inquiry some time since made, because  
11 could offer none which would satisfy myself. I pray  
you only to believe that it proceeded from any thing ra­  
ther than want of respect or regard. 1 shall now com­  
ply with your request.  
The highest-toned propositions which I made in the  
Convention were for a President, Senate, and Judges du­  
ring good behavior; a House of Representatives for three  
years. Though I would have enlarged the legislative  
power of the General Government, yet I never contem­  
plated the abolition of the State Governments; but, on  
the contrary, they were, in some particulars, constituent  
parts of my plan.  
This plan was, in my conception, conformable with the  
striot theory of a Government purely republican; the es­  
sential Criteria of which are, that tho principal organs of  
the executive and legislative departments be elected by  
the people, and hold the offices by a responsible and tem­  
porary or defeasible nature. ,  
A vote was taken on the proposition respecting the ex­  
ecutive. Five States were in favor of it, among these  
Virginia; aud though, from the manner of voting by de­  
legations, individuals were not distinguished, it was mo­  
rally certain, from the known situation of the Virginia  
members, (six in number, two of them, Mason and Ran­  
dolph, professing popular doctrines,) that Madison must  
have concurred in the vote of Virginia. Thus, if I sinned  
against republicanism, Mr. Madison is not less guilty.  
I may truly, then, say that I never proposed either a  
President or Senate for life; and that I neither recom­  
mended nor meditated the annihilation of the State Gov­  
ernments.  
And I may add that, in a course of the discussions in  
the Convention, neither the propositions thrown out for  
debate, nor even those voted in the earlier stages of de­  
liberation, were considered as evidences of a definitive  
opinion in the proposer or voter. It appeared to be in  
some sort understood that, with a view to free investiga­  
tion, experimental propositions might be made, which  
were to be received merely as suggestions for considera­  
tion. Accordingly, it is a fact that my final opinion was  
against an Executive during good behavior, on account of  
the increased danger to the publio tranquillity incident  
to the election of a magistrate of liis degree of perma­  
nenoy. In the plan of a constitution which I drew up  
while the Convention was sitting, and which I communi­  
cated to Mi*. Madison about the close of it, perhaps a day  
or two after, the office of President has no longer dura­  
tion than for three years.  
This plan was predicated upon these bases: 1. That  
the political principles of the people of this country would  
endure nothing but a Republican Government. 2. That  
in the actual situation of the country it was itself right  
and proper that the republican theory should have a full  
aed fair trial. 3. Thai^to such a trial it was essential  
that the Government should be so constructed as to give  
it all the energy and the stability reconcileable with the  
principles of that theory. These were the genuine sen­  
timents of my heart, and upon them I then acted.  
I sincerely hope that it may not hereafter be discover­  
ed that, through want of sufficient attention to the last  
idea, the experiment of Republican Government, even in  
this country, has not &#x27;been as complete, as satisfactory,  
and as decisive as could be wished.  
Very truly, dear sir, your friend and servant,  
A. HAMILTON.

IfgW YOBS. September 19, 1803.  
My Leah Sir I will make no apology  
for my delay in answering your enquiry some  
timo since made, because I could offer none  
which would satisfy myself—I pray you only  
to believe that it proceeded from any thing  
rather than want of respect or regard—I  
shall now comply with your request. •  
The higest toned propositions which I  
made in the convention were for a President,  
Senate and Judges, during good behavior;  
a House of Representatives for three years.  
Though I would have enlarged the legislative  
power of the general government, yet J never  
contemplated the abolitions of the state gov­  
ernments; but on the contrary, they were in  
some particular*, oonstitutent parts of my  
plan.  
This plan was, in my conception conforma­  
ble with the strict theory of government  
purely republican; the ogsentjal criteria of  
whiefy are, that the principal organs ? pf tfye  
Executive and Legislative departments, be  
elected by the people, and hold their offices  
by a responsible and temporary nature.  
A vote was ta£pn fin tj}P propositjqn respec­  
ting the Executive. Five states were in fa­  
vor of it; among these Virginia; and though  
from the manner of voting by delegations,  
individuals were not distinguished; it was  
morally certain, from the known situation of  
the Virginia members (six in number two of  
them Mason and Randolph professing popu­  
lar doctrines) that Madison must have con­  
curred in the vote of Virginia—Thus, if I  
sinned against republicanism, Mr. Madison  
was not less guilty.  
_ I may truly then say that I never proposed  
eithej a president or senate for life, and that  
I neither recommended nor mediated the  
annihilation of the state governments.  
&#x27; And I may add, that in the course of the  
discussions in the convention, neither the  
prepositions thrown out for dehate, nor even  
those voted m the curlier stage of delibera­  
tion were considered as evidenees of a de­  
finitive opinion in the proposer or voter. It  
appeared to me to be ip some sqrt understood,  
that, with a view to free iuvestigatiflp, ex- 1  
perimental propositions might be made,  
which were to be received merely as sugges­  
tions for consideration. Accordingly it is a  
fact, that my final fipipion was against an  
Executive during the good behavior, on ae- 1  
cout of tlie increased dangpr to t}je public  
tranquility incident to the election of a mag­  
istrate of this degree of permanency. In  
the plan of a constitution which I drew up  
while the conventiou was sitting, and which 1  
I communicated to Mr. Madison, about the  
close of it, perhaps a (Jay or two after, the  
president has no greater duration than for  
three years.  
. Tills pjup. was predicated upon.these has as*.  
1. That the political principles of the people  
of tliis country would endure nothing but a  
republican government. 2. That in the actu- &lt;  
d situation of the country, it was jjself right 1  
md proper tjjat the reputjUe^n theory should :

energy and the stability reconcilable with the 1  
principle of that theory. These were the 1  
genuine sentiments of my heart, and .upon i  
then?, then, I acted. . 1  
I sincerely hope that it may not hereafter 1  
be discovered that through want of sufficient  
attention to the last idea, the experiment of
