			London November 11. 1806.  
					  
					We flattered ourselves at the date of our last dispatch which was of September the 11th., that we should have been able to have concluded a Treaty with the British Commissioners and to have transmitted it to you before this, on all the interesting topicks  
						which are embraced by our instructions, and on terms that would be approved by our government. The disposition which had been shewn by the members of the Cabinet, with most of whom we had had conversations on the subject, and the sentiments which had been expressed in our  
						Conferences by the plenipotentiaries who had been appointed to meet us, independent of other considerations of a favorable character, had inspired us with great confidence in such a result. We regret however to be now under the necessity of stating to you, that altho’ every  
						topick has been frequently taken into Consideration and discussed, and there is good cause to believe that a Satisfactory arrangement may be obtained of many of the great points, and an admissible one of the inferior, that nevertheless nothing has been concluded on any point,  
						and an insurmountable difficulty has occurred on one which is deservedly considered of the first importance to our country.  
					The opportunity by which we propose to forward this communication is so pressing as to time, that we fear we shall not be able to give you all the details which have attended the negotiation since the 11th. of September We shall however endeavor to comprise  
						in it every circumstance which may be necessary to Convey a just idea of its present state and probable result  
					You were apprized by our last of the delay to which we had been previously exposed by the indisposition of Mr. Fox. It happened unfortunately that the same cause subjected us afterwards to much interruption in the prosecution of the business, which was  
						finally suspended altogether, for several weeks, by his death. We add however with pleasure that we experienced no delay on account of Mr. Fox’s indisposition, which did not appear to us, in consideration of all circumstances, to be natural and reasonable; that the business  
						was resumed by the British Commissioners as soon after his death and interment as a suitable respect for his memory would permit; and that it has been pursued by them since in a manner to evince an evident desire on their part to bring it to a speedy conclusion  
					Our attention was naturally drawn from the Commencement of the negotiation to its principal objects, the impressment of our seamen and the trade with enemies colonies, the former of which presented the more serious difficulties with this govt. As we Knew  
						that the tranquility of our Country, if not its peace, was essentially connected with a suitable provision for this great Interest, it seemed useless to proceed to those of minor consideration ’till it should be satisfactorily disposed of. Hence the greater portion of our  
						time and labour has been bestowed in our several conferences on this latter topick. We have said every thing that we could in support of our claim that the flag should protect the crew, which we have contended was founded in unquestionable right, whose enjoyment it  
							was indispensible to Secure, by an unqualified and positive stipulation in its favor. We have also proposed in a spirit of accommodation, every suitable expedient that we could devise, consistent with that principle to obviate the inconveniences which  
						it was urged on the other side were likely to result from its admission. But all our efforts have so far proved ineffectual. The right was denied by the British Commissioners who asserted that of their government to Seize its subjects on board neutral merchant vessels on the  
						high seas, and who also urged that the relinquishment of it at this time would go far to the overthrow of their naval power on which the safety of the State essentially depended. At one time and that very recently, there was a prospect of an agreement on conditions, which  
						appeared to be just and fair between the parties, but that seems now to have completely vanished. It was urged by the British Commissioners that the proposition which we had made, to give the aid of the local authorities of the United States, to apprehend and restore  
						deserters from their vessels, as an inducement for their government to acknowledge the right which we contended for in favor of the vessels of the United States on the high Seas, did not furnish a complete remedy for the evil complained of. It did not follow, they observed,  
						that Such deserters would in all or even in most Cases retire into the country; they might on the contrary go on board an American vessel which might put immediately to Sea, where our flag would protect them: that such desertions might also take place in a neutral port and be  
						attended with like consequences. They were therefore desirous that we should stipulate that a law should be passed by the Congress (to be of course reciprocal) which should make it penal for the Commanders of American Vessels to take deserters from those of Great Britain  
						under Such Circumstances, they being British Subjects, and likewise to make it the duty of our government to restore them on their arrival in the U. States, on suitable application, and due proof being made of their persons. We agreed to provide a remedy for this presumptive  
						evil. They then observed that the term &quot;deserters&quot; was too limited, according to their law, to comprehend those who might leave their merchant vessels; that it would apply only to such as left their ships of war; they therefore proposed that we should enlarge its import by  
						adding the following terms &quot;seafaring people quitting their service&quot; to which we also agreed; taking care however, by confining their operation always to the case of real desertion from Some vessel not to give them a greater range, in the sense of our law, than we had at  
						first intended. To our original project thus amended the British Commissioners seemed to give their assent; they agreed expressly to propose an article to the Cabinet to that effect, from which circumstance, and from what had previously occurred in our conferences, we were  
						led to conclude that they would all Support it. To give the Cabinet full time for deliberation on the subject, our next meeting was postponed to so distant a day as to admit it. We are sorry to add that the result of that deliberation was a rejection of the project, and with  
						it an end to all hope of obtaining at this time in its stead any satisfactory stipulation by treaty respecting impressments.  
					Our next interview had been appointed to take place on the 5th. inst. On the preceding day we received a note from the British Commissioners with a report from a Law Officer of the Crown, which seemed to be communicated to prepare us for what they had to  
						announce more formally the next day. The report of the Crown Officer had been made in answer to an enquiry from them, On what ground Great Britain claimed a right to take by force her seamen from on board the merchant vessels of other powers on the high Seas? The report  
						justified the pretension by stating that the King had a right by his prerogative to require the service of all his seafaring subjects against the enemy and to Seize them by force wherever found, not being within the territorial limits of an other power and that as the high  
						Seas were extra-territorial, the merchant vessels of other powers navigating on them, were not admitted to possess Such a jurisdiction as to protect British Subjects from the exercise of the King’s prerogative on them. We were desired to consider the communication as a  
						private one, at least in that stage. At our meeting the next day the British Commissioners Stated explicitly, but in a very conciliating manner, that it was not in their power to adopt an article in the spirit of our project: that the board of admiralty had been consulted on  
						the subject, as had also been the Crown officers in Doctors Commons, who united all, without exception, in the opinion, that the right of their government in the case in question was well founded, and ought not to be relinquished. They added that under such circumstances, the  
						relinquishment of it, was a measure, which the government could not adopt, without taking on itself a responsibility which no ministry would be willing to meet however pressing the emergency might be. They presented to us at the same time a Counter-project which they  
						intimated they did in obedience to instructions from their government. It was proposed by this that laws should be passed by the parties respectively whereby it should be made penal for the Commanders of British vessels to impress American citizens on board American vessels  
						on the high Seas, and for the officers of the U. States to grant certificates of citizenship to British subjects. The negotiation being thus brought, as it were, to an issue on this very important point the discussion of the whole Subject was necessarily resumed at  
						considerable length and with great earnestness We maintained with all the force in our power, the right of our government on the principle and to the extent, we had done before, and denied as strenuously the pretension advanced by G. Britain: their counter-project we declared  
						was utterly inadmissible, as its adoption, So far from Securing the just rights of the United States and remedying the evils of which they Complained, would prove an abandonment of their rights, and a Sanction, in a considerable degree at least, to future injuries. The  
						British Commissioners, after Supporting with great force, but with candour, the claim of their government, assured us that it was willing to do any thing in its power to Satisfy the United States on the ground of their complaints, which might be done without a relinquishment  
						of their claim. This interview terminated in the appointment of an other to take place on the 7th. when it was agreed that the subject should be definitively disposed of; and in the interim, that each party should revolve it in mind to see if it might not be possible to  
						Suggest Some plan which should prove equally satisfactory to both. We met on the 7th. according to appointment and having repeated what we had said before of their counter-project, which we deemed altogether inadmissible, and having also stated that we could adopt none which  
						did not allow our ships to protect their crews, or suggest any accommodation other than what we had already proposed as an inducement to their government to admit the principle, and it appearing that no change had taken place in their instructions, we came at length to the  
						main question, that which had in truth been the great object of the meeting. What was next to be done under existing circumstances? Should the negotiation cease? The British Commissioners expressed an earnest desire that it should not. We had repeatedly stated that unless  
						this interest was provided for in a satisfactory manner, it would be useless to touch the other points, Since a continuance of the same abuses on their part, would render of no effect any arrangement however eligible which might be made of them. They intimated that their  
						government gave at present no cause of offence to the U. States by impressments and that we might be satisfied it would continue to pursue the same policy that it might be better that neither party should abandon its rights and that each should endeavour to act, in respect to  
						the injuries complained of by the other, in such a manner as to prevent future complaints. They thought that with such a disposition on both Sides, seconded by a correspondent exertion, which they assured us existed and would be made on  
						their part, it was likely that the interest of each country would be placed on a footing equally Secure for temporary purposes, and much more so in respect to a permanent good understanding than it could be for either by a treaty, which should substitute  
						for it the object which it sought. We desired them to communicate to us by note the ideas which they had thus expressed, which they readily undertook by proceeding to give a sketch of them at the time, and evidently shewing a disposition to make it as acceptable to us, as  
						they could do consistently with the principles of their government. We adjourned to meet again on the 12th. instant without having come to any positive decision as to the part which it became us to take in the delicate conjuncture in which we were placed. We did not fail  
						however in shewing our regret, that no suitable provision had been made for the very important question, which had been so long under consideration, to express our sincere desire to pursue that Course in respect to the other objects of the negotiation, which our duty under  
						existing circumstances would permit and which might be most likely to promote a good understanding between the two Countries.  
					On the 9th. instant we received from the British Commissioners the note which they had promised us in the last interview, which we have found to Correspond in all respects with what we had been taught to expect. We have also weighed with due consideration  
						the great question which is propounded by it and are decidedly of opinion that it is our duty to proceed to the other objects of the negotiation, leaving that of impressment on the ground on which it will be placed by this note and our acting on it. Many strong reasons favor  
						this Course while none occur to us of any weight against it. When we take into view all that has passed on this subject we are far from Considering the note of the British Commissioners as a mere circumstance of form. We persuade ourselves that by accepting the invitation  
						which it gives and proceeding in the negotiation, we shall place the business almost if not altogether on as good a footing as we should have done by Treaty, had the project which we offered been adopted. The time at which this note was presented to us, and the Circumstances  
						under which it was presented, being when the negotiation was absolutely at a stand on this very question and we had informed the British Commissioners that we could do nothing, if it was not provided, give the act a peculiar degree of solemnity and obligation. It was sent to  
						us as a public paper and intended that we should so consider it, and with the knowledge and approbation of the Cabinet. It ought therefore to be held as obligatory on the government, in its just import, as if the Substance had been Stipulated in a Treaty.  
						It is just also to give it a liberal Construction in favor of the U. States, in consideration that it is the act of the British government. In that view it merits attention that every thing is expressed in it that could be desired, except the relinquishment of the principle:  
						that in speaking of impressments, the exercise of that act on the high seas is not mentioned, an omission which we Know to have been intentional. From a full view of all these Circumstances we think it fair to infer that this government intends to conform its conduct in  
						future to the just claims of the United States on this great interest, while by particular motives of policy it deems it improper to relinquish a claim, especially at this time, which has been long sustained and acted on by it, and which has been heretofore strongly Supported  
						by the national feeling or more properly speaking prejudice; for we cannot believe that the interest of the nation is in favor of it, more especially if the project which we proposed should be adopted, or correspondent regulations entered into, to produce the Same effect, by  
						friendly co-operation between the two governments. We are therefore of opinion, if the negotiation had contemplated an arrangement of this point alone, that it would be proper to close the business amicably on the ground on which it is thus placed, rather than to break it off  
						abruptly and take an unfriendly attitude from which no advantage could possibly arise in any one respect, and much injury might and most probably would for a time at least even to this very interest. How much stronger then is the obligation to proceed when the other objects  
						of the negotiation are taken also into view, all of which it is highly interesting to arrange and several of which, of the first importance, it is as we believe in our power to arrange. We are aware that our instructions impose on us the necessity of providing satisfactorily  
						for this great interest, as one of the conditions on which a treaty shall be formed. But it does not appear that the fair object of that instruction will not be satisfied by the arrangement thus made. The prohibition not to Conclude a Treaty otherwise than on the condition  
						adverted to, is fairly to be understood as applicable to a refusal on the part of this government, to arrange the business on just principles, and an adherence by it to its former improper and offensive conduct, which it is well known is not the case. Impelled by these  
						motives and considerations we shall go forward in the negotiation and use our best efforts to place the other points on the most advantageous footing that may be practicable. We are the more confirmed in this resolution from the consideration that we shall be able to do it  
						without exposing our government or country to any the slightest inconvenience. It is known to the British Commissioners that in proceeding, under existing circumstances, we shall do it on our own responsibility; a responsibility however which we undertake in full confidence  
						that our conduct and the motives of it will be approved.  
					We shall meet the British Commissioners to morrow to proceed in the negotiation which we are persuaded it will not require any considerable length of time to conclude. All the other topicks have been heretofore brought into view and discussed but without  
						any intention in that stage, on either side, to push a definitive Settlement of them. So much however has been said on each by the British Commissrs. as to enable us, as we presume, to form, a tolerably correct estimate of what may be obtained on several especially those of  
						the greatest importance. In respect to the trade with enemies colonies they have repeatedly told us that on condition we would land the cargoes in the U. States, store them for a month and change the Ship, they would agree that the trade  
						might be free afterwards in the productions of those colonies to other countries including the parent Country of the colony. We have refused to comply with the condition in respect to the storing of the goods for a month and changing the ship. Some arrangement more  
						advantageous to us than their proposition will we have no doubt be obtained. The question of blockade, and others Connected with it, may we think be satisfactorily arranged. They will agree also to acknowledge our jurisdiction to the extent of a league from our Coast; we have  
						claimed that acknowledgment to the extent of three leagues. The trade with India, they will put on the footing it held under the Treaty of 1794. That with the West Indies must we fear rest on the ground of the most favoured nation only. Something we think may also be done in  
						favor of an intercourse with the British Provinces to the North of us. But our claim to an indemnity has been much discouraged tho’ we have never ceased to press it with great Zeal. We shall continue to use our best efforts to place all these great concerns on the most just  
						and advantageous ground in our power, and shall hasten to communicate to you the result with the greatest possible dispatch, as soon as the business is concluded.  
					We have been cautious not to compromit ourselves with respect to the law which was passed the last session of the Congress prohibiting importation of certain British manufactures into the United States after the 15th. of this month, either with this  
						government or individuals: We think it our duty however to observe that our opinion of the propriety of Suspending that law remains unchanged as it was communicated to you in our letter of September the 11th. Indeed the uniform conciliatory disposition of this government has  
						strengthened us in that opinion  
					Of the state of the war on the Continent the Gazettes which accompany this will give you all the information which we possess. Of the ultimate views of Prussia, under existing circumstances, we Know nothing. So far she has followed the example and  
						participated the fortune of Austria as exhibited in the last campaign, and so far has Austria imitated hers of the same epoch, by viewing with an apparent indifference events which menace the overthrow of both. We have the honor to be with great

was not in their power to adopt an article in  
the spirit of our project; that the board o

■V/hich no minister would Ec willing to meet,

They presented to us at the same time a  
counter project, which they intimated they

government, it was proposed by this, that  
law s should be passed by the parties respec­  
tively, whereby it sbCuUl be made penal for

&#x27;on this very importnntpoint, the discussion of  
the whole subject was necessarily resumed,  
;.v considerable length, and with great ear­  
nestness. We maintained wijh all the force  
id our power, the right of our government  
oti the principle, and to the extent, we had  
done before, and denie-l as strenuously the  
preten-dor. advanced by G-retu-Britain : their  
counter project \vc declared was utterly in­  
admissible, as its adoption, so f*r from se­  
curing thejr.si. rights of ihe United States,  
and remedying the evils of which they com­  
plained, -would prove an abandonment of  
their rights, and a sanction, in a considerable  
degree at least, to future injuries. The liri -  
fish commissioners, aft* r supporting with  
•great force, but with candour, the claim of  
their government, as u&#x27;vtl us that it was&#x27;  
willing to do any thing in it* power, to s:i­  
tMV the United Star. or thivgrour.d of their  
complaints, wli&#x27;.ch might 1 c* dune without a  
&#x27;relinquish.neat of tin ir cl lira. This inter­  
view terminated in the appointment of ano­  
ther to tube place on the fth, when it was  
agreed th it ti e subject should be definitely  
disposed of; and in the interim, that each  
par-y sh:a.;d re volve it in mind, to see if it  
might not bo possible to suggest some plan  
which would nrove eor.alh sat.sfuctorv to

pointment, and having rept atcd what we  
had sai-t before of their counter project,  
v. hich v. c deemed altogether inadmissible,  
land having also stated that we could adopt

to admit tire principle, and it appearing (hat

&#x27;iions, v.e came at length to the main ques­  
tion, lSuit which had in truth been the great  
o&#x27;.jcct i.t their meeting, what was text to be  
done under exist:. circumstances ? Should  
the negotiation ccaj - ? Tlic British commis­  
sioners express&#x27;d tin earnest desire that it  
should n«.t. We had repeatedly stilted that  
unless this interest was provided for in a sa- j  
tis.aetory manner it would Ire useless to |  
touch tiie other points, since a continuance  
of tltc same abuse on their part, would ren­  
tier of no effect any arrangement however  
&#x27;eligible which might Ire made of them.—  
They intimated that their government gave  
iit present no cause of ollence to the United  
Stales by impressments, and that we might  
be satisfied it would continue to pursue the  
?an»e policy ; that it might be better that  
r.wither pa.rt\ should abandon its rights, and  
f hat each should endeavor to act, in res­  
pect to the injuries complained of by the  
other, in such a manner as to prevent future  
complaints. They thought that with such  
:i disposition on both sides, seconded by a cor­  
Te-prindent exertion, which they assured us  
existed, and would be made on their part,  
St was likely that the interest of each coun­  
try would be placed on a footing equally se­  
cure f -,r temporary purposes, and much more  
in respect to a permanent good understand­  
ing, than it could be for either by a treaty,  
v nidi should cv&#x27;en stipulate for it the object  
which is nought. We desired them to com­  
  
i  
Arairci&#x27;.i to us by note, the ideas which they  
had thus expressed, which they readily un­  
de*:-toe it, by proceeding to give a sketch of  
them at the lime, and evidently shewing.a  
disposition to make it as acceptable to us  
as the, could do, consistently wi*h the prin­  
ciples of their government. We adjourned  
to nic&#x27;et again on the 12th instant, without  
having come to any positive decision as to  
the part which it became us totnlicin the  
delicate conjuncture in which we were pla­  
ced. We did not fail, however, in shew­  
ing our regret, that no suitable provision  
had been made forthe very important ques­  
tion, which had been so long under consi­  
deration, to express our sincere desire to  
p su • that c mrse In respect to the other  
ohiects of the negotiation, which our duty,  
under existing circumstances, would permit  
and which might he most likely to promote  
« good understanding between the twocoun­  
tries.  
On the 9th instant, we received from the  
Priii&#x27;,h columnsinners the note which they  
had promised us in the last interview, which  
we have found to correspond* in all respects

view it merits attention, that e&lt;*fcry thing is  
expressed in it that could lie desired except  
the relinquishment of the principle : that in  
speaking of impressments, the exercise of  
that act on the high seas is not mentioned,  
an omission which we know tohavc beenin­  
tentioiuil. l&#x27;rom a full view of all these  
circumstances we think it fair te infer, that  
this government intends to conform its con­  
duct in future to the just claims of. the Uni­  
ted States, on this great interest, while by  
particular motives of policy, it. deams it  
proper to relinquish a claim, especally at  
this time, which has been long sustained and  
acted on by it, and which has been heretofore  
strongly supported by the national (feeling,  
or more properly speaking, prejudice; for  
we cannot believe that the interest of the  
nation is in favor of it, more especially if the  
project which we proposed should be adopt­  
ed, or correspondent regulations entered in­  
to to reduce the same effect by friendly co­  
operation between the two governments.—  
Wc arc therefore of opinion, if the negoti*  
ation had contemplated an arrangement of  
this pf&gt;lnt alone, that il Svonldbt? proper to  
close the business amicably, on the.ground  
on which it i.-&gt; thus placed, rather thaft to  
break off abruptly and take an unfriendly at­  
titude, ii&#x27;om which no advantage could pos­  
sibly arise in any one respect, and much  
injury might and most probably would for a  
•meat least, even to this very interest. How  
much stronger then is the obligation to pro­  
ceed, when the other objects of the negotia­  
tion .are taken also into view’, all of which  
it is highly interesting to arrange, and seve­  
ral of which, of the first consequence, it is,  
as wre believe, in our power to arrange. Wc  
are aware that our instructions impose on  
us the necessity of providing satisfactorily  
for this great interest, as one of the conditi­  
ons on-which a treaty shall be formed. But  
it does not appear, that the fair object of  
tKht instruction will not be satisfied by the  
arrangement thus made. The prohibition  
not to V onclude a treaty otherwise than on  
the condition adverted to, is fairly to be un­  
derstood as applicable to a refusal on the  
part of this government, to arrange the bu­  
sines on just principles, and an adkerentc  
by it to its former improper and offensive  
conduct, which it is well known is not the  
case. Impelled by these considerations and  
motives, wc shall go forward in the negoti­  
ation, and use our best efforts to place the  
  
oilier points on the most advantageous foot­  
ing that may lie practicable. \Ve arc the  
more confirmed in this resolution, from the  
consideration, that we shall be able to do it  
without exposing onr government or country  
to any, the slightest inconvenience. It is  
known to the British commissioners, that in  
proceeding under existing circumstances, we  
shall do it in our own responsibility ; a re­  
sponsibility, however, which we undertake  
in full confidence, that our conduct and the  
motives of it will be approved.  
We shall meet the British commissioners  
to-morrow to proceed in the negociation,  
which we arc pursuaded it will not require  
any considerable length of time to conclude.  
Ail the other topics have been heretofore  
brought into view and discussed, but w ithout  
any intention in that stage, on either side,  
to push a definitive Settlement cf them. So  
much, however, has been said on each by  
the British commissioners, as to enable us,  
as we presume, to form a tolerably correct  
estimate of What may be obtained on several,  
especially those of the greatest importance.  
In respect to the trade with enemies colo­  
nies, they have repeatedly told us, that on  
condition we should land the cargoes in the  
U. States, store them for a month, and change  
the ship, they would agree that the trade  
might be tiee afterwards in the production  
ot those colonies, to other countries inclu­  
ding the parent country of the colony. We  
have refusedjto comply with the condition in  
respect to the storing of the goods for a  
month, and changing the ship. Some ar­  
rangement more advantageous to us than  
their proposition, will, wc have no doubt, be  
obtained. The question of blockade, and o­  
thers connected with it, may, we think, be  
satisfactorily arranged. They will agree  
also to acknowledge our jurisdiction to the  
extent of a league, from our coast: we have  
  
Maimed that acknowledgement to the extent  
af three leagues. The trade with India, they  
will-put on the footing it held under the tre&#x27;a­  
•y ot 1791. 1 hat with the West ladies,  
oust, we tear, rest on the ground of the most  
favored nation only. Something we think  
nay also be done in-favour of an intercourse  
with the British provinces to the north of us.  
lint our claim toan indemnity has been much  
liscouraged, though we have never ceased to  
&gt;ressit with great zeal. We shall continue  
0 use our best endeavtrs to place all these  
;reat concerns on the most justand advanta­  
geous ground in our power, and shall h asten  
lo communicate to you the result with the  
greatest possible dispatch, as soon as the busi­  
ness is concluded.  
We have been cautiofas not to compromit  
mu-selves with respect to the law, which was  
passed the lust session of the congress, pro­  
hibiting the importation of certain British  
manufactures into the United States, after  
the 15th of this month, either with this go­  
vernment or individuals. We think it our  
duty, however, to observe, that our opinion  
of the propriety tif suspending that law, re­  
mained unchanged, as it was communicated  
toyou in our letter of September the 11th.  
Indeed the uniform conciliating disposition  
of this government, has strengthened us in  
that opinion.  
Of the state of the war on the continent  
the gazettes which accompany this, will  
give you ‘aU the information which we pos­  
sess. Of the z.ltimate views of Prussia under  
existing circumstances, we know nothing.*—  
So tar she lias followed the example and  
participated the fortune of Austria, as exhi­  
bited in the last campaign, and so far as Au­  
stria imitated hfcrs of the same epoch, by  
viewing with an apparent indifference, c­  
venls which menace the overthrow oi both.

^j0t 6. London, Aov. 11, 1806.  
tuk, , ,  
V/e flattefe 1 ourselves at the date ef our  
Jast dispatch, which was of September 11th,  
that we should have been abie to hare con­  
cluded a treaty with the British commission­  
ers, and to have transmitted it to you before  
this, on all the interesting topics which are  
embraced by our instructions, and on terms  
that would be approved by our government.  
(The disposition which had been shewn by  
m ) members of the cabinet, with most of  
Ehom we had had conversation# on the sub­  
  
mm me ...  
ssVd in fvir cmiTeicnces by the plenipo­  
i ie«&lt; who had been appointed to meet  
ilepeYvfent of other Considerations of a  
character, bad inspired us with  
imf!Pence in nch a remit. w&lt; re­  
,e cr. to he flow under the nece«si-I  
to you, that although every to-j  
,Ve&#x27;i&#x27;tcntl.&#x27; taken into consider- !  
useed, nr.d there is ^Ood cause |  
  
to believe that a abtisfactciy artraffg^ment  
may be obtained of many of the great points,  
and an admissible one of the inferior, that  
nevertheless nothing has bden Concluded on  
any point, and an insurmountable difficulty  
has occurred on one which is deservedly con- !  
sidcrcd of the first importance to our coun­  
try. k ,  
The oppor tunity by which we propose to  
forward this communication, is so pressing  
ns to tiine, that we fear wc shall npt be ab&#x27;e  
to give you all the details which have attend­  
ed the negociation, since, the 11th of Sep­  
tember. We shall, however,&#x27;endeavour to  
comprise in it every circumstance which  
may be necessary to convey_a just idea of  
its present state’andp&#x27;rob. ble result. .  
You were apprized by our last of the de­  
lay to which we had been previously expo­  
sed by the indisposition of Mr. FoX. It hap­  
pened unfortunately that the same cause  
subjected us afterwards to much interrupti­  
on in the prosecution of the business, which  
was finally* suspended altogether, for seve­  
ral weeks, by his death. Wc add, however,  
with pleasure, that v*e experienced no de­  
lay on account of Mr. Fox’s indisposition,  
which did not appear to us, in consideruti  
cn of all circumstances, to be natural and  
&#x27;reasonable; that the business was resumed  
by the British commissioners as soon after  
i his‘death, and interment, as a suitable rcs­  
•pect for his memory wourd permit ; a: d  
that it has been pursued by them since in a  
manner to evince an evident desire on their  
part to bring it to a speedy conclusion.  
Our attention was naturally drawn, from  
the&#x27;commencement of the negotiation, to its  
principle object&#x27;s, the impressment of onr  
senmen and the trade with enemies colonies,  
the former of which presented the most se­  
rious difficulties with this government. As  
we knew that the tranquility of our country,  
if not its peace, was essentially connected  
with a suitable provision f r this great in­  
terest, it seemed useless to proceed to those  
of minor consideration, till it should be sa­  
tisfactorily jdisposed of. Hence t e greater  
portion of our time and labor has been bes­  
towed m our several confe. rences or. this lat­  
ter topic. We have said every thing that  
we could in support of our claim, that the  
flag should protect the crew, which weh ve  
contended was founded in unquestionable  
right, whose enjoyment it was indispensa­  
ble to secure, by an unqualified and positive  
stipu’ation in its favor. We hate also pro­  
posed in a spirit of accommodation, every  
  
suitable expedient that we could devise, con­  
sistent with that principle, to obviate the in­  
conveniences which it was urged on the o­  
ther side were likely tC result from its ad­  
mission. But all pur efforts have so far pro­  
ved ineffectual.. The right Was denied bv  
the British commissioners, who asserted that  
of their government, to seize its subjects on  
board neutral merchant .vessels on the high  
seas, and who also&#x27;urgdd that the relinquish­  
ment of it at this time, would go far to theo­  
verthrow of their naval power, on which the  
safety of the state essentially depended. At  
one time, Sfid that very recently, there was  
a prospect of an agreement, on conditions,  
which appeared to he just and fair between  
the parties, but that seems now to have com­  
pletely vanished. It was urged by the Bri­  
tish commissioners, that the proposition  
which we had made, to give the aid of the  
local authorities of the United States, to ap­  
prehend and restore deserters from their  
vessels, as an inducement for their govern­  
ment to acknowledge the right which we con­  
tended lor, in favor of the vessels of the Uni­  
ted States on the high seas,, did not.furnish  
a complete remedy for the evil complained of.  
It did not follow, they observed, tfaat such  
deserters would in all, or even most cases  
retire into the country ; they might, on the  
contrary, go on board Wn American vessel  
which might put immediately to sea, where  
our flag would protect them ; that such de­  
sertions might also take place in a neutral  
port, and be attended with like consequen­  
ces. They were therefore desirous that we  
should stipulate, that a law should be pas­  
sed by the Congress, &lt;to be of course reci­  
(procai) which should n^ike it penal for the !  
commanders of American vessels to take de­  
serters from those of Great-Britain under  
*ich circumstances, they being British sub­  
jects, and likewise to make it the duty of  
our government to restore‘them on their ar­  
rival in the United Stater,, on suitable ap­  
plication, and due proof being made of their  
persons. We agreed to provide a remedy  
for this presumptive evil. They then ob­  
served that the term “ deserters” was too  
limited, according to their law, to conapfQ­  
hend those who might leave their merchant  
vessels; that it would apply only to such as  
left their ships of war ; they therefore pro­  
posed that we should enlarge its import by  
adding the following terms, “ sea-faring  
people quitting their service,” to which we  
also agreed, taking care, however, by confi­  
ning their operation always to the case of  
real desertion from some vessel, not to give  
them a greater range in the sense of our law  
than we had at first intended. To our ori­  
ginal project, thus amended, the British com­  
missioners seemed to give their assent: thev  
  
agreed expressly to propose an article to the  
cabinet to that effect, from which circum­  
stance, and from what had previously occur­  
red in our conferences, we were led to con­  
clude that they would also support it. To  
give the cabinet full time for deliberation on  
the subject, our next meeting was postpo­  
ned to so distant a day as to admit it. We  
are sorry to add that the result of that de­  
liberation was a rejection of the project, and  
with it an end to all hope of obtaining, at  
this time, in its stead, any satisfactory sti­  
pulation by treaty respecting impressments.  
Our next interview had been appointed  
to take place,on the 5th instant. Oil the  
preceding day we received a nrtte from the  
British commissioners, with a report from  
a law officer of the crown, which seemed to  
he communicated to prepare us for what  
they had to announce more formally the  
next dftv. 1 he report of the crown officer  
had been made in answer to an inquiry  
from them, on what ground Great-Britain  
claimed a right to take by force her seamen  
from on board the merchant vessels Of other  
powers, on the high seas f rl he report jus­  
tified the pretension by stating, that the king  
had a light, by his perogative, to require  
the service of all his seafaring subjects, a­  
gainst the enemy, and to seize them by force  
wherever found, not being within the terri­  
torial limits of another power: that as the  
high sea* were extra-territorial, the mer­  
chant vessels of other powers navigating  
them, were not admitted to possess such a  
jurisdiction as to protect British subjects  
from the exercise ot the king’s prerogative  
over them. VV e were desired to consider  
the communication asa private one, at least  
in that stage. At our meeting the next day  
the Br.tish commissioners stated explicitly,  
but in a very conciliating manner, that i

I United States, received on the 22d qf March,  
  
1808.  
  
“ On the 9th instant, we received from the  
British commissioners the note which they  
had promised to us in the last interview,  
which we had found to correspond in all re¬  
spects with what we have been taught to ex¬  
pect. We have also weighed with due consi¬  
deration, the great question which is propoun¬  
ded by it, and are decidedly of opinion, that  
it is our duty to proceed to the other objects  
of the negotiation, leaving that of impress¬  
ment on the ground on which it will be placed  
by this note, and not acting on it. Many

THE EXAMINER.  
  
strong reasons favour lliis course, while none  
occur to us of any weight against it. Wlieii  
we take into view all that has passed on this  
subject we are far from considering the note  
of the British commissioners as a mere cir¬  
cumstance of form. We persuade ourselves  
that by accepting the invitation which it  
gives, and proceeding in the negotiation, we  
shall place the business almost, if not altoge¬  
ther, on as good footing as we should have  
done by treaty, had the project which we of¬  
fered tJiem been adopted. Tlie time at which  
this note was presented to us, and the circum¬  
stances under which it was presente&lt;l, being  
when the negotiation was absolutely at a  
stand on this very question, and we had in¬  
formed the British commissioners we could  
do nothing, if it was not provided for, to give  
the act a peculiar degree of solemnity and  
obligation. It was sent to us as a public pa¬  
per, and intended that we should so consider  
it, and with the knowledge and approbation  
of the cabinet. It ought, therefore, to be  
held as obligatory on the government in its  
just import, as if the substance had been sti¬  
pulated in a treaty. It is just, also, to give it  
a liberal construction in favour of the United  
States, in consideration that it is the act of  
the British government. In that view it me¬  
rits attention, that every thing is expressed  
in it that could be desired, except the relin-  
&lt;piishment of the principle ; that in speaking  
of impressment the exercise of that act on the  
high seas, is not mentioned ; an omission  
which we know to have been intentional.  
From a full view of all these circumstances,  
we think it fair to infer that this government  
intends to conform its conduct in future to the  
just claims of the United States, on this great  
interest, while by particular motives of poli¬  
cy it deems it improper to relinquish a claim,  
especially at this time, which has been long  
sustained and acted on by it, and which has  
been heretofore strongly siip|)orted by the  
national feeling, or more strongly speaking,  
prejudice ; for we cannot believe that the in¬  
terest of the nation is in favour of it, more  
especially, if the project which we propose  
should be adopted, or correspondent regula¬  
tions entered into, to produce the same effect  
by friendly co-operation between the two go¬  
vernments.”

vessels of other powers, on the high seas.  
His reply furnished the ground on which  
the government refused to treat for the  
discontinuance of impressments. He

force wherever found, if not within the  
territorial limits of another power ; and

jects from the exercise of the king’s pre-  
rogative over them.
