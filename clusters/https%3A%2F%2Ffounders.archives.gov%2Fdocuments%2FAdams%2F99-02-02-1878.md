, in early times it was first perceived; in early times that no middle course remained for America remained; between unlimited submission to a foreign Legislature, and a total Independence of its claims: men of reflection, were less apprehensive of danger, from the formidable Power of fleets and Armies they must determine to resist; than from those Contests and dissentions, which would certainly arise, concerning the forms of Government to be instituted, over the whole and over the parts of this extensive Country. Relying however, on the purity of their intentions, the Justice of their cause, and the Integrity and Intelligence of the People under an overruling Providence, which had so Signally protected this Country from the first, The Representatives of this Nation,  not only broke little more than half its present Number to pieces the chains which were forging, and the Rod of Iron that was lifted up, but frankly cutt asunder the Ties which had bound them and launched into an ocean of Uncertainty.  
The Zeal and ardour of the People, during the revolutionary War, supplying the Place of Government, commanded a degree of order, sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of Society. The Confederation, which was early felt to be necessary, was prepared, from the models of the Batavian and Helvetic Confederacies, the only Examples which remain with any detail and precision, in History, and certainly the only ones, which the People at large, had ever considered. But reflecting on the Striking difference in so many particulars, between this country and those, where a Courier may go from the seat of Government to the frontier in a single day, it was then certainly foreseen by Some who assisted in Congress at the formulation of it, that it could not continue for ten Years be durable.  
Negligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations, if not disobedience to its authority, not only in individuals but in States, soon appeared with their melancholly consequences; Universal Languor;—jealousies and Rivalries of States; decline of navigation and Commerce; discouragement of necessary manufacturers; universall fall in the value of Lands and their produce; contempt of public and private faith; loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations; and at length, in discontents, Animosities, combinations, partial conventions, and insurrection, threatning some great national Calamity.  
In this dangerous emeregen Crisis, the People of America, were not abandoned, by their usual good Sense, presence of Mind, resolution or integrity.—Measures were pursued to concert a Plan, to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and Secure the blessings of Liberty. The public disquisitions, discussions and deliberations issued in the present happy Constitutions of Government.  
Employed in the Service of my Country abroad, during the whole course of these transactions, I first saw the Constitution of the United States in a foreign Country.  Irritated by no litterary Alliteration, animated by no public debate, heated by no party animosity, I read it with great Satisfaction, as a result of good heads, prompted by good hearts; as an Experiment, better adapted to the Genius, Character, Situation and relations of this nation and Country, than any which had ever been proposed or suggested. In its general Principles and great outlines, it was conformable to such a system of Government, as I had ever most esteemed and in some States, my own native state particularly in particular, had contributed to establish.  Claiming a right of Suffrage, in common with my fellow Citizens, in the Adoption or rejection of a Constitution which was to rule me and my Posterity, as well as them and theirs, I did not hesitate to express my Approbation of it, on all Occasions, in public and in private.  It was not then, nor has been since, any Objection to it, in my mind that the Executive and Senate were not more permanent. If there is any Party in this Country formed for the purpose of introducing an hereditary or even a more permanent Executive or Senate, which however I have no reason to believe or suspect, I am not entirely of that number possessed of their Confidence, nor Admitted to their Secret. Nor have I ever entertain’d a thought of promoting any Alteration in it, but Such as the People themselves, in the course of their experience Should see and feel to be necessary or expedient and by their Representations in Congress and the state Legislatures, according to the Constitution itself adopt and ordain.  
Returning to the bosom of my Country, after a painful Seperation from it; for ten Years, I had the honour to be elected to a station under the new order of Things,  of which have been attended with as much constancy as my health and strength would admit, and I have repeatedly laid myself under the most Serious Obligations to Support the Constitution. The operation of it has equalled the most sanguine Expectations of its Friends: and from an habitual Attention to it; satisfaction on its administration and delight in its effects, upon the Peace, order, Prosperity and Happiness of the nation, I have acquired an habitual Attachment to it, and Veneration for it.  
What other form of Government indeed can so well deserve our Esteem and love?  
There may be little Solidity in an ancient idea; that congregations of Men into Cities and nations, are the most pleasing Objects in the sight of Superiour Intelligencies: but this is very certain, that to a benevolent human Mind, there can be no Spectacle presented by any nation, more pleasing, more noble, majestic, or august, than an Assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other chamber of Congress, of a Government, in which the Executive Authority, as well as that of all the Branches of the Legislature; are exercised by Citizens selected, at regular periods, by their neighbours to make and execute Laws for the general good. Can any Thing essential? any Thing more than mere ornament and decoration be added to this by Robes or Diamonds? Can Authority be more amiable or respectable; when it descends from Accidents, or , or institutions established in remote Antiquity, than when  fresh from the Hearts and Judgments  and enlightened People? For it is  represented? it is their  and only for their  under whatever form, it may appear.  The Existence of Such a Government as ours, for any length of time, is a full proof of a general dissemination of Knowledge and Virtue, throughout the whole body of the People. And what Object;  or Consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind? If national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it Springs, not from Power or Riches, Grandeur or Glory, but from conviction of national Innocence Information and Benevolence.  
In the midst of these pleasing Ideas, We Should be unfaithfull to ourselves, if We Should ever loose sight of the danger to our Liberties, if any thing partial or extraneous Should infect the Purity of our free, fair, virtuous and independent Elections. If an Election is to be determined by a majority of a single Vote, and that, can be procured by a Party, through Artifice or corruption, the Government may be the Choice of a Party, for its own Ends, not of the nation for the national good. If that Solitary Suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by Flattery or Menaces, by fraud or Violence, by terror Intrigue or Venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American People, but of foreign nations.  It may be foreign nations who govern Us, and not We the People who govern ourselves. And candid Men will acknowledge, that in Such Cases, Choice would have little Advantage to boast of our Lot or Chance.  
Such is the amiable and interesting System of Government (and such are some of the Abuses to which it may be exposed) which the People of America have exhibited to the Admiration and Anxiety of the Wise and virtuous of all nations for Eight Years under the Administration of a Citizen, who by a long Course of great Actions, regulated by Prudence, Justice, Temperance and Fortitude; conducting a People, inspired with the same Virtues and animated with the same ardent Patriotism and love of Liberty, to independence and Peace, to increasing Wealth and unexampled Prosperity; has merited the Gratitude of his Fellow Citizens, commanded the highest Praises of foreign nations, and Secured immortal glory with Posterity.  
In that retirement which is his voluntary choice, may he long live to enjoy, the delicious recollection of his Services, the Gratitude of his Country Mankind; the happy fruits of them to himself and the World, which are daily increasing, and that Splendid Prospect of the future Fortunes of his Country, which is opening from Year to Year. His Name will may be still a rampart, and the Knowledge that he lives a Bulwark, against all open or Secret Ennemies of his Countries Peace. This great Example has been recommended to the imitation of his Successors, by both Houses of Congress, and by the Voice of the Legislatures and the People, throughout the nation.  
On this Subject it might become me better to be Silent, or to Speak with diffidence: But as Something may be expected, the occasion, I hope will be admitted as an Apology, if I venture to SayThat  
If, a Preference, upon principle, of a free Republican government, formed upon long and Serious Reflection, after a diligent and impartial Inquiry after truth; if, an Attachment to the constitution of the United States, and a conscientious determination to support it, untill it Shall be altered by the Judgments and Wishes of the People, expressed in the mode prescribed in it;—if, a respectfull Attention to the constitutions of the individual States, and a constant caution and delicacy towards the State government; if an equal and impartial regard to the Rights Interests, honour and Happiness of all the States in the Union, without preference or regard to a northern or Southern an Eastern or Western position, their various political opinions on unessential Points Sentiments or their personal Attachments; If, a Love of virtuous men of all Parties and denominations; if a love of Science and letters, and a wish to patronize every rational Effort to encourage Schools Colledges, Universities Academies and every Institution for propagating Knowledge, Virtue and Religion among all Classes of the People: not only for their benign Influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and Classes and of Society in all its forms; but as the only means of preserving our Constitution from its natural Enemies the Spirit of Sophistry, the Spirit of Party, the Spirit of Intrigue, the profligacy of Corruption and the Pestilence of foreign Influence, which is the Angel of destruction to elective Governments; If, a love of equal Laws, of Justice and humanity in the interiour Administration; if an inclination to improve Agriculture, Commerce, and Manufactures for Necessity Convenience and defence; if, a Spirit of Equity and humanity towards the aboriginal nations of America and a disposition to meliorate their condition, by inclining them to be more friendly to Us, and our Citizens to be more friendly to them; If, an inflexible determination to maintain Peace and inviolable Faith, with all Nations, and that System of Neutrality and Impartiality, among the belligerent Powers of Europe; which has been adopted bymy predecessor this Government, and So Solemnly Sanctioned by both houses of Congress, and applauded by the Legislatures of the states and the publick opinion untill it shall be otherwise ordained by Congress; if, a personal Esteem for the French nation, formed in a residence of Seven years, chiefly among them, and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honour and Interest of both nations; if, while the conscious honour and Integrity of the People of America, and the internal Sentiment of their own Power and Ennergies must be preserved, an earnest Endeavour to investigate every just cause and remove every colourable Pretence of complaint; if an Intention to pursue by amiable negotiation a Reparation for the Injuries that have been committed on the Commerce of our Fellow Citizens, by Whatever Nation; and if Success cannot be obtained, to lay the Facts before the Legislature that they may consider, what further measures the honour and Interest of the Government and its Constituents demand. if, a resolution to do Justice, as far as may depend upon me at all times and to all nations, and maintain Peace, Friendship and Benevolence with all the World; if an unshaken Confidence in the honour, Spirit, and Resources of my country the American People on which I have So often hazarded my all and never been deceived; if, elevated Ideas of the high Destinies of this Country, and of my own duties towards it founded on a Knowledge of the moral Principles and intellectual improvements of the People, deeply engraven on my mind in early Life, and not obscured but exalted by Experience and Age;—And, with humble Reverence I feel it to be my Duty to add, if, a veneration for the Religion of a People, who profess and call themselves Christians, and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for Christianity, among the best Recommendations for the public service: can enable me, in any degree to comply with your Wishes, it shall be my strenuous Endeavour, that this Sagacious Injunction of the two houses shall not be without Effect.  
With such and this great Example before me; with the Sense and Spirit, the Faith and Honour, the duty and Interest of the Same American People, pledged to Support the Constitution of the United States I entertain no doubt of its continuance, in all its Ennergy and my mind is prepared, without hesitation, to lay myself under the most Solemn Obligations to support it, to the Utmost of my Power.  
And may that Being, who is supream over all, the Patron of order, the Fountain of Justice, and the Protector, in all Ages, of the World, of virtuous Liberty, continue his Blessing, upon this Nation and its Government and give it all possible Success and duration, consistent with the Ends of his Providence

over the whole and over the parts of this extensive counjry. Relying, howe-  
ver, on the purity of their intentions, the justice of their cause, and the inte  
grity and intelligence of the people, under an over-ruling providence, which  
had so signally protected this country from the first, the representatives of  
this nation, then consisting of litile more than half its present numbers, not  
only broke to pieces the chains which were forging, and the rod of tren that  
was lifted up, but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them,  
and launched into an ocean of uncertainty.  
  
The zeal and ardour of the people, during the revolutionary war, supply- |  
  
ing the place of government, commanded a degree of order, sufficient at least  
for the temporary preservation of society. The confederation, which was ear-  
ly felt to be necessary, was prepared from the models of the Batavian and  
Helvetic confederacics, the only examples whichremain, with any detail and  
precision, in history, and certainly the only ones which the people at large  
had ever considered, But reflecting on the striking difference, in so many  
particulars, between this country and those where a courier may go from the  
seat of government to the frontier in a single day, it was then certainly fore=  
seen by some who assisted in congress at the formation of it, that it could not  
be durable.  
  
Negligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations, if not dis-  
sbedience to its authority, not only in individuals but in states, soon appeared,  
with their melancholy consequences ; universal languor, jealousies and rival-  
ries of states ; decline of navigation and commerce ; discouragement of neces-  
sary manufadtures; universal fall in the value of lands and their produce ;  
contempt of public and private faith ; loss of consideration and credit with  
foreign nations ; and at length, in discontents, animosities, combinations, par-  
tial conventions, and insurre¢tion, threatening some great national calamity.  
  
In this dangerous crisis the people of America were not abandoned by  
their usual good sense, presence of mind, resolution and integrity. Measures  
were pursued to concert a plan, to form a more perfec? union, establish jus-  
tice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the com:mon defence, promote  
the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. The public disqui»

Employed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of  
these transactions, I first saw the constitution of the United States in a for  
reign country. Irritated by no literary altercation, animated by no public de-  
bate, heated by no party animosity, I readit with great satisfaction, as aresult  
of good heads, prompted by good hearts; as an expel iment, better adapted  
tthe genius, charaéter, situation and relations of this nation and. country,  
than any which had ever been froposed or suggested. In its general princie  
ples and great outlines, it was conformable to such a system of government  
as I had ever most esteemed, and in some states, my own native state im  
particular, had contributed to establish. Claiming a right of suff age, in  
common with my fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a constitution  
which was to rule me and my posterity, as well as them and theirs, I did  
wot hesitate to express my approbation of it, on all occasions, in public and  
im private. It was not then, nor has it been since, any objection to it, in my  
mind, that the executive and senate were not more fermenent. Norhavel ever  
entertained a thought of jromoting any alteration in it, but such as the people  
themselves, in the course of their experience, should see and feel to be necessary

W HAT OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT INDEED CAN SO WELL  
DESERVE OUR ESTEEM AND LOVE °  
  
There may be little solidity in an ancient idea, that congregations pf men  
into nations, “and cities ave the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior  
intelligencies ; but this 1s very certain, that to a benevolent human mind there  
can be no spectacle frese nted by any nation, more fleasing, more noble, ma-  
jestic or august, than an as sembly like to that which has so often been seen in  
this and the eshir chamber of CONLTESS, of a government in which the exeeu-  
tive authority, as well as that of all the Sramches of the legislature, are ex-  
ercised by citizens selecied, at regular periods, by their neighbours, to make  
and execute laws for the general good. Can any thing essential, any thing

ours, for any length of time, is a full proof of a general dissemination of  
suemange and virtue, th) oug rhout the 2 vhole body of the / C6, hle. And what

not from / ower or riches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of national  
innocence, information and benevolence  
  
In the midst of these pleasing ideas, 2ve should be unfaithful to ourselves,  
if we should ever lose sight of the dans ver to our liberties, if any thing par-

single vote, and that can be / rocured by a party, thy ough h art fc eor corruption,  
the government thay be the choice of a party, i its oun ends, not of @ na-

foreign nations, 4y flaticry or menaces, by fra nd or viole nce, Ov terror, in

WHEN it was firft perceived in early times that no  
middle courfe for America remained, between unlimited  
{ubmisfion to a foreign legif&#x27;ature, and total independence  
of its‘claims, men of reflection mere icfs apprehenfive of  
danger, from the formidable power of the flees and armies,  
they muft determine to refifl, than from thote contefts and  
diffentions which would certainly arife, conceriing the  
  
forms of government to L« inftituted over the whole and  
over the parts of this extenfive country. } Relying, howe-

teéted this country from the firlk, the reprefentatves of this  
nation, little more than half its prefent numbers, not only  
broke to preces the chains which were forging, and the rod  
of iron that was lifted up, but frankly cut afunder the ties  
which had bound them, and launched into an ocean of  
uncertainty.  
  
The zeal and ardour of the people during the revolution-  
ary war, fupplying the place ct government, commandeda  
degree of one futficient at leait for the temporary pre-  
{ervation of fociety. The confederation which was early felt  
to be neceflary, was prepared fiom the models of the Bata-  
vian and Helvetic confedevacies, the only examples which  
remain with any detail and precifion. in hiflory; and cer-  
j tainly the only ones, which the people at large, had ever  
/conlidered, But refleéting on the itriking difference, in  
‘fo many particulars, between this. country and thofe, where  
-acourier may go from the feat of government to the fron-  
tier in a fingle day, it was thea certainly forefeen by thofe  
who alfifted in Congrefs, at the formation of it, that it  
‘could not be durable.

pollerity, as well as them and theirs, I did not hefiae to

and in private. It was not then, nor has it been fince,

WHEN 1t was firft perceived,.in early  
times, that no middle course for America  
remained ; between unlimited submission  
to a foreign Legislature, and a total Inde­  
pendence of s claims ; men of refiec­  
tion, were lels apprehensive of danger,  
from the formidable power of flects and  
armies, they must determine to resist, than  
from those contests and diffentions which  
would certainly arise, concerning the forms  
of Government, to be instituted, over the  
whole-and over the parts of this extensive  
country. Relying, however, on the pu-.  
rity of their intenuoss, the justice of their  
cause, and the integrity and intelligence of  
the people, under anoverruling providence,  
which had so signally proteéted this coun­  
try from the firft, the Representatives of  
this nation, then consisting of little more  
than half the present numfer,.nat only broke  
2o preces the chains which wers forging,  
and the rod of iron whick was lifted up,  
but frankly cut asunder the ties whick had  
bound them, and launched into an ocean of  
uncertainty, s o  
The zeal and ardour of the people, dur­  
ing the revolutionary war, fugplying the  
place of government, commanded a degree  
of order, fufficientat least for the tcm{porary  
preservation of society. The confedera­  
tion which was early felt to be necessary,  
was prepared from the models of the Ba­  
tavian and Helvetic confederacies§the on­  
ly examples which remain with any derail  
and precision in history, and certainly the  
only ones which ‘the people at large had  
ever confidered,~—But, reflefling on- the  
firiking di&amp;chcs, in {o many parti€ulars,  
between this cauntry and. those where a  
courier may go from the feat of govern­  
ment to the frontiet in a single day, it‘was.  
then certainly forefeen by some who assist­  
ed in Congress at the formation of it, that  
it could not be durable.’ RS  
Negligence of “its regulations, tnatten­  
tion to its recommendation, if not disobe­  
dience to its suthority, pot only in indivi­  
duals, but in States, soon appeared, with  
their melancholly consequences ; univer­  
sal langour, jealousies and rivalrics of  
States ; decline of navigation and com­  
merce ; discouragement of neccflary ma­  
nufaßlurers; universal fall in the value of  
lands and their produce ; contempt of  
public and private faith ; loss .of .conﬁdcra- “  
ticn and credit with foreign nations ; and  
at length, in difconteats, animolities, com­  
binations, partial conventions, and infur­  
zeflion, t&amp;{m‘;ng’fowc‘ great npational ca-  
SR o i  
  
In this dangerous crisis, #he people of  
America were not. ibandonéd by their u­  
sual good sense, presence of mind, resolu­  
tion or integrity—measures were pursued  
1o congert a plan, to form a more perfel¥  
Wﬁabﬁib jultice, ensure” domestic  
tranquility, provide for the common de­  
fence, promote the general welfare, and  
secure the blessings of liberty. The pub­  
lic disquisitions, discussions ‘and delibera­  
tions i?l‘ucd in the prelent happy constitu­  
tion of government.  
Employed in the service of my country  
abroad during the whole course of thele  
tranfaflions, 1 firft saw the Constitution of  
the United States in a foreign country, Ir­  
ritated by no literary altercation, animated  
by no public debate, heated by no&#x27; party  
animosity, I read it with great fatisfation,  
as a result of good heads, prompted by  
good hearts ; as an experiment, better a­  
dapted to the genius, charalter, fitaation  
and relations of this nation and country,  
than any which had ever been proposed or  
suggested. In its general principles and  
great outlines, it was conformable to such  
a {yltem of government, as I had ever moit  
esteemed, and in some slates, my own na­  
tive state in particular, had contributed to  
eftablith, Claiming a right of fuffrage in  
common with my fellow-citizens, in the  
adoption or rejeftion of a conflitution  
which was to rule me and my posterity, as  
well as them and theirs, I did not hefitata  
to exprefls my approbation of it, on all oc­  
casions, in public and in private, It.was  
not then, nor has been since, any obje&amp;ion  
to it, in my mind, that the Executive and  
Senate were pot more permanent, Nor  
have I entertained a thought of promo­  
ting any alteration in it, but such as the  
people themlelves, in the course of their  
experience should fee and feel to be ne­  
cessary or expedient, and by their Repre-.  
fentatives in Congress and the State Le- ;  
giflatures, according to the Confitution  
nfelf, adoPt and ordain. {  
Returning&#x27;to the bosom of my country,  
after a painful separation from it, for ten  
years, | had the honor to be ele@ed toa  
flation under the new order of things, and  
I have repeatedly laid myfelf under the  
most serious obligations to support the con­  
flitution.~~The operation of it has equal­  
led the mofl sanguine expe&amp;ations of its  
friends ; and from an habitual attention to  
lit, fansfaltion in its administration and de- |  
light in its effells, upon the peace, order,  
prosperity and happiness of the nation. I  
have acquired an habitual attachment to it,  
and veneration for it, ;  
  
What other jform of government indecd  
can so well deserve our cfieem and love ?  
There may be little {olidity in an an­  
cient idea, that congregations of men into  
cities and vations, are the most pleasing  
objells in the fight of superior intelligen­  
cies : But this s very certain, that toa  
benevolent and human mind, there can be  
no {peétacle presented by any nation, more  
pleasing, more noble, majestic or augufi,  
than an allembly like that which has been  
{o often seen in this and the other cham­  
ber of Congress, of a government, in  
which the exccutive authority, as wellas  
that of all the branches of the legislature,  
are exercised by citizeas feleéled, at regu­  
lar periods, by their neighbours, to make  
and execute laws for the general good.  
Can any thing eflential, any thing.more  
than mere ornament 2nd decoration be ad­  
ded to this by robes and diamonds ? Can  
authority be more amiable or refpeflable,  
when it descends from accidents, or infli­  
tutions eftablithed in remote antiquity,  
than when it {prings frefh from the hearts  
and judgments of an honest and enlighten­  
ed people P For it is the people only that  
are represented : It 1s their, power 2nd  
majelty, that is refle@ed and only for their  
good, in every legitimate government, un­  
der whatever form it may appear. The  
existence of such a government as ours, for  
any length of time, is a full proof of a ge­  
neral dissemination of knowledge and vir­  
tue, throughout the whole bedy of the  
people. And what obje&amp;t or considera­  
tion more pleasing thanm this can be pre­  
feated to the human mind ? If national  
pride is ever juflifiable or excusable, it is  
when it springs, not from power or riches,  
grandeur or glory, but from. conviftion of  
national innocence, information and be­  
nevolence. :  
In the midst of these pleasing ideas, we  
should be unfaithful to ourselves, if we  
should ever. lose fight of the danger to our  
liberties, if any thing partial or extraneous  
should inset the panty. of our free, fair,  
virtuous and independent eleftions. If an  
elettion is to be determined by a majority.  
of a single vote, and that can be procured  
by a party, through artifice or corruption,  
the government may be the choice of a  
party, for its own ends, not of the nation,  
for the national good. If that solitary fuf­  
frage can be ebtaiped by foreign mations  
by flattery or menaces, by fraud or vio­  
lence, by terror, intrigue or venality, the  
government may not be the choice of the  
American peaple, but of foreign&#x27; nations,  
It may be foreign nations who govern us,  
and not we the ggople, who govern our­  
selves. And cum ‘men will acknowledge  
that in such cafles, choice would have fittle  
advantage to boast of, over lot or chance..  
Such 1s the amiable and interefling {y{-  
tem of government (and such are some of  
the aßu%cs to which it may be exposed)  
which the people of America have exhi­  
bited, to the admiration and anxie?’ of the  
wife and virtuous of all nations, for eight  
years, under the administration of a citizen  
who, by a long courle of great altions, re­  
gulated by prudence, juflice, . temperance,  
and fortitude, conduéting a people,. inspir­  
ed with the fame virtues, and animated  
with the fame ardent patriotilm and love  
of liberty, to independence and peace, to  
encreafing wealth, and unexampled ;ro&#x27;l’- |  
perity ; has merited the gratitude of his  
fellow-citizens, commanded the highest  
praises of foreign pations, and secured im­  
mortal glory with poflerity. -  
lln that retirement which is his yolunta­  
ry choice, may he long live to enjoy the  
dclicious recolleftion of his services, the  
  
gratitude of mankind ; the happy fruits of  
!‘ them to himfelf and the world, which are  
daily increasing and that splendid profpe&amp;t  
of the future fortunes of his country,which  
is openipg from year to year. His name  
may be Rill a rampart, and the knowledge  
that he lives, a bulwark against all open or  
secret enemies of—his country’s peace,

to the imitation of his fucceflors, by both  
~ houles of Congrels] and by the voice of

“ HEN it was fir ft perceived, in early times, that  
  
no middle courfe for America remained; between

Independance of its claims: men of reflection, were lets  
apprehenfive of danger, from the formidable power of fleets  
and armies, they muft determine to refift, than from thofe  
contefts and diffentions, which would certainly arife, con-  
cerning the forms of Government to be inftituted, over the  
whole and over the parts of this extenfive country. Rely-

their caufe, and the integrity and intelligence of the peo-

manded a degree of order fufficient at leaft for the tempo-

was early felt to be angst te was prepared from the mo-  
dels of the Batavian and Helvetic Confederacies, the only  
examples which remain with any detail and precifion in  
hiftory, and certainly the only ones, which the people at  
large, had ever confidered. But reflecting on the ftriking  
difference, in fo many particulars, between this country  
and thofe, where a courier may go from the feat of Govern-

as an experiment, beiter adapted to the genius, character,

which had ever been propefed or fuggeited. In its general

ment to it, and veneration for it.  
  
*“ WHAT OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT INDEED CAN  
SO WELL DFSERVB OUR BSTEEM AND LOVE?  
  
‘* There may be little folidity in an ancient idea, that  
congregations of men into cities and nations, are the moft  
pleafing obje&amp;s in the fight of Superior Intelligencies : but  
this is very certain, that to a benevolent human mind, there  
can be no fpectacle prefented by any nation, more pleafing,  
more noble, majeftic or auguft, than an affembly, like that  
which has fo often been feen in this and the other chamber  
of Congrefs, of a government, in which the Executive au-  
thority, as well as that of all the branches of the Legifia-  
ture, are exercifed by citizens felected, at regular periods,  
by their neighbours, to make and execute laws for the ge-  
neral good. Can any thing effential, any thing more than  
mere ornament and decoration, be added to this by robes  
ordiamonds? Can authority be more amiable or refpecta-  
ble, when it defcends from accidents, or inftitutions eftab-  
lifhed in remote antiquity, than when it fprings freth from  
the hearts and judgments of an honeft and enlightened  
People? For it isthe People only that are reprefented : it is  
their power, and majefty that is reflected, and only for their  
good, in every legitimate government, under whatever form  
jt may appear. The exiftence of fuch a government as onrs,  
for any length of time, is a full proof of a genera! diffemina-

S P E E C H:  
. i When, it was firlt perceived, in early  
times, .that no middle courfe for America  
remained , between Onlitnitted lubmiflimi to  
afofreiftn legiflaturct and a total indepen­  
dence of its ejtfims ; fihen of reflection were  
Jefs apprchenfive or danger, from the-formidable  
powftf of &#x27;fleets and armies, they  
mult determine to, refitt, than from thole  
contelts and difierttions, which would cer­  
tainly arife, corice riling the forms of go­  
vernment to be lnltituted, over, the whole  
and over the partsof this exreafive country.  
Belying, however, on the purity of their in­  
tentions, the j&#x27;dlire of their caufe, and the  
integrity and intelligence of the people un-  
  
ncr an overruling rroviucncc, which nan 10  
ftgnafty protected this country from the fn (1.  
The reprefentatives of this nation, then  
conflfting of little more than half its prefent  
numbers, not only broke to pieces the chains  
  
wnicn were xorging, ana ine roo 01 iron  
that was lifted up, out frankly cut afunder  
the ties Which had bound them , and launch­  
ed into an ocean of uncertainty.  
&#x27; The zeal and ardour of the people dur­  
ing the revolutionary war, fupplying the  
jUce of government, commanded a degree  
pt order, fufficient at leafl lor the tempory  
prefer vat ion of fociety. The confederation,  
which was early felt to beneceflary, was pi e­  
pared frmn the models of Batavian and Hel­  
vetic confederacies, the only examples which  
remain with any detail and prccifion, in hif­  
tory, and certainly the only ones, which the  
people at large have ever confldered. But  
reflecting on the flriking difference, in fo  
niany particulars, between this, country and  
  
thofe, where courier may go from the feat  
of government to the frontier m a fingle  
day, it was then certainly forefeen by foine  
who affitted in cowgrefi at the formation of  
Jt, that it could not be durable.  
&quot; Negligence of its regulations, inattenti­  
on to its recommendations, if not difobedi.  
ence r . its authority, not only in individuals  
but in Hates, foon appeared, with their me­  
lancholy confeqoences ; nniverfal langour,  
jealoufles and rivalries of Hates; decline of  
navigation and commerce 1 difcoragement  
of nereflary manufactures 1 upivcrfal fall in  
the value of lands and their produce; con­  
tempt of public and private faith; lots of  
consideration and credit with foreign nati­  
ons, and at length, in dtfeon tents, anomo­  
fities, combinations, partial conventions,  
and infurrection, threatening foine national  
calamity.  
In this dangerous crifis, the people of  
America were not abandoned by their ufuel  
good fenfc, prefence of mind, refolution, or  
integrity. Meafuret were purfued to con­  
cert a plan, to form a more perfect union,  
  
eftabliih juflice, enfnredotncHic tranquility,  
provide for the common defence, promote  
the gtneral wtlfare, and fecort the bleflings  
  
of liberty. The public difquifitions, dif-  
cuflions and deliberationt iflncd in the pte­  
fent happy confliturion of government.  
,. Employed in the fervice of my country  
abroad, during the whole courfe of thele  
tranlactions, 1 firlt,few the conftitution of  
the United States in a foreign country lr.  
ritated&#x27;by no literary alteration, animated  
by no public debate, heated by iiq party  
animofity,, I read it with great fatisfaCKon,  
as a refute of good heads, prompted by good  
hearts as an experiment, better adapted  
to toe genius, character, lunation and rela­  
tions of this nation and country, than any  
which had ever been propafed or fuggelred.  
In its general principles and great outlines,  
it was conformable to fuch a lyltem of go&quot;  
vernniient, as 1 have ever ntoft efleemed,and  
in fume Hates, my own harive Hate in parti­  
cular, had contributed to eHablifli. Claim­  
ing a right of fuffrage, in common with my  
fellow-citizens in the adoption or rejection  
of a conltitution which was to rule me and  
,my pottery, as well as them and theirs, 1  
did not heiitate to exprefs my approbation  
of it, on all occafiops, in public and in pri­  
vate. It was not then, nor has been fincc,  
  
to it, in my mind, that the  
  
any objection  
  
executive and senate were not more perma&quot;  
nent. Nor havel ever entertah ed a thought  
or promoting any alteration in it, bi t fuch  
as the people themfelves, in the courfe of  
their experience fhould fee and feel to be  
.neceil&#x27;ity or-expedient, and by thetr rcpre-  
  
frntattves tu congrefs and the Hate legifla  
turcs, aceprding to the couHiiuiion iilelf,  
adopt and ordain. - ;  
&quot; Returning to the bofom of my country,  
after a paiiifv.il (epavation from it, for ten  
years, I had the honor to be elected to a tta­  
tiou Under the new order of things, and I  
have repeatedly laid myfojf under the molt  
fei&#x27;ious obligations to fupport the conHltuti­  
on. The operation of it has equalled the  
nio&#x27;l fanuine expectations of its friends:  
and from a habitual attention to ir, fatisfac­  
ttou in its adminiftratiou and delight in its  
effects, upon the peace, order,&#x27; pi ofperiiy  
and happinefs of the nation, I have acquired  
an habitual attachment to it, and veneiation  
for if.  
&quot; What other form of povernment indeed  
  
can fo well delerve our eltecm and love?  
&quot; There may be little folidity in an anci­  
ent idea, that congregations of men iuto ci­  
ties and nations, are the mofl plnafing ob­  
jects in the fight of Superior IntrNigencies :  
but this is very certain, that to aloenevolent  
human mind, there can be nofpectable pre­  
fented by any nation, more pleufing, more  
noble, majeftic or augnft than an aflembly,  
like that which has fo often been feen in  
tli is and the other chamber of congrefs, of a  
government, in which the executive autho­  
rity, as well as that of all the branches of the  
legifl iture, are exercifed by citizens felected  
  
at regular periods, by their neighbors, to  
make and execute laws for the general good.  
Can any thing eflenttal, any thing more  
than mere ornament and decoration be added  
to this by robes or diadems ? Can authority  
be more amiable or refpectahle, when it de­  
feends from accidents, or inHirutions efta­  
blifhed in remote antiquity, than when it  
fprings f rem from the hearts and judgment!  
ofanhoneH and enlightened people ? For  
k is the people only that are reprefented  
it is their power and majefty that is reflected  
and only for their good, in eery legitimate  
government, under whatever form it may  
  
appear. The exiHence of fuch a govern­  
ment as oars, for any length of timt, is a  
fall proof of a general diflemination of  
knowledge and virtue, throughout the hole  
body of the people. And what object or  
eonii deration more pleafmg than this can be  
prefented to the human mind f If national  
pride is ever juftifiabie or excufeable, it it  
when it fpt ings, not from power or riches,  
grandeur or glory, bat from conviction of  
national innocence, iutormation and bene  
volenee.  
&quot; In the mldft of thefe pleafmg ideal, we  
mould be unfaithful to earfelvet, it we  
(houldever lofe fight of the danger to onr  
liberties, if my thing partial or extraneous  
fttoald infect the porky of oar free, fair,  
virtuous ailT independent elections. If an  
  
election isiote determined by a majority of  
a fingle vote, and that can be produced by  
a party, through artifice or corruption, the  
government may be the choice of party, for  
its own ejs, not of the nation, for the na­  
tionalgjood. If that folitary fuffrage can  
beobSTned by foreign uatibns, by flattery  
or menaces, by fraud orviolencr, by error,  
intrigue or venality, the government may  
not be the choice of the American psople,  
but of foreign nations. It may be foreign  
nations who govern us, and not we the peo­  
ple, who govern out felvet.. And candid  
men will acknowledge, that in fuch cafes,  
choice would have little advantage to boaft  
of, over lot or chance.  
Such is the amjable and ipterefling fy­  
Hem of government (and fuch are tome of  
the abides to which it may beexpofed) which  
the people of America have exhibited tothe  
admiration and anxiety ot tbe wife and vir  
  
tuous of all nations, for eight. years, under  
  
the adminiftratiou of a citizen, who, by a

prefs my approbation of it on al!  
occafions, in public and in private.  
Ite was not then, nor has been  
fince, any objection to it, in my  
mind, that the executive and  
fenate were not more permanent.  
Nor have! entertained a thought  
of promoting any alteration in it,  
but fuch as the people themfelves,  
in the courfe of their experience,  
Should-fee and feel to be neceffary  
or expedient, and by their repre  
fentatives in congreis and the  
ftate legiflatures, according to the  
conftitution itfelf, adopt and or-  
dain.  
  
Returning té the bofom of niy  
country, after a painful feparation  
from it, for ten years, I had the  
honor to be eleéted to a ftation  
under the new order of things,  
and I have repeatedly laid mydelf  
under thé moit ferious obligatious  
to fuppott the conititution. The  
operation of it has equalled the  
moft fanguine expectations of  
its friends ; and from an habitual  
attention to it, fatisfaction in its  
adminftration, and delight in its  
effets upon the peace, order,  
profperity and happinefs of the  
nation, | have acquired an habi-  
tual attachment to Ht; and venera-  
tion for it.  
  
What other farm of goutrnment  
indeed can fo well deferve our efleem  
and love ? a  
  
There may be little folidity in  
am amncient idea, that congrega-  
tions of men imto Cities and. na-  
tions, are the moft plezfing ’ ob-  
jects in the fight of fuperior in-  
telligences;. but this is very cer-  
tain, that toa benevolent, humane  
ynind, there can be no fpedtacle  
prcfeated. by any nation, more  
  
  
  
  
  
auguft, than/an affembly like that’  
  
which has fo often been feen in  
this and the other chamber’ of  
congrefs, of a government, in  
which the executive authority, as  
well as that of all the branches of  
the legiflature, are exercifed by  
citizens feleed, at regular pe.  
tiods, by their neighbours, to  
make and execute laws for the  
genera} good. Can any thing ef  
fential, any thing more than mere  
ornament and decoration be added  
to this by robes or diamonds ?—~  
Can authority be more amiable or  
refpectable, when it defcends  
from accidents, or inftitutions ef.  
tablifhed i remote antiquity, than  
when it fprings frefh from the  
hearts and judgments of an honeft  
and enlightened people? For, it  
is the people only that ate répree  
fented : it is their power and mas  
jefty that is reflected, and only  
for their good, tn every legitimate  
government, under whatever form  
it may appear. The exiftence of  
fuch a government as our’s, for  
any lengtivof time, isa full proof  
of a genetal diffemination of  
knowledge and ‘virtue, through.  
out the whole body of: the peo-  
ple. And what obje€&amp; or confi  
deration more pleating than this  
can be prefented to the human  
mind ? If national pride is ever  
juftifiable or excufeable, it is  
when it {prings, not from powef  
or riches, grandeur or glory, but  
from conviction of national innoe  
cence, information and benevos  
lence.  
  
In the midft of thefe pleafing  
ideas, we fhould ‘be unfaithful to  
ourfelves, if we fhould ever lofe  
  
fight of the danger to our libew

tion is to be determined by a ma-  
jority of a fingle vote, and that  
can. be procured by a party,  
through artifice or corruption, the  
government may be the choice of  
aparty, for its own ends; not of  
the nation, for the national good.  
If that folitary fuffrage can be ob-  
tained by foreign nations by flat-  
tery or menaces, by fraud or vio-  
lence, by terror, intrigue or vena-  
lity, the government may not be  
the choice of the American peo-  
ple, but of foreign nations. It  
may be foreign ‘nations who go-

would certainly arifc, concerning the

-, on t!ie puriry of their intentions,

grity aod intelligence of the people,  
under an over-ruling providence,

half its prefent numbers, not only  
broke to pieces thc chains which w ere

lifted up, but frankly cut afunder the  
t&#x27;us w hich had bound them, and laun-

The zeal and ardour of the people  
during the revolutionary war, lap-  
plying the place of government, com-  
manded a degree of order, fulheient  
at lealt for tlie temporary preferva-  
tion of fociety. I he confederation  
which was early felt to be neceliary,  
was prepare*.! from tne models of the  
Y Ba&#x27;avian and Helvetic confederacies,  
* trie only examples which rciuain with  
any detail and pretifion, in hiitory ;  
and certainly the only ones, which  
the people at large had ever confider-  
ed. Cut reflecting on the Arikiug  
difference, in fo many particular*, be-  
tween this country ^nd thofe where  
a courier may go from the feat of go-  
vernment to the frontier in a iin-  
gie d:iy, it vat then certainly fore-  
seen by fome who aflifted in Congrefe  
at the formation of it, that it could  
« not be durable.  
  
Negligence of its regulations, inat-  
tention to its recommendation, if not  
lUbbedrencc to its authority, not on-  
ly in individualsbut in Itates, loon ap-  
peared with their melancholy confe-

fall m the value of lands, and tlwir

In this dangerous crifi3 the people  
• f America were not abandoned by  
their ufual good fenfe, pretence of  
mind, refoluth r. and integrity, Mea-  
sures were put iued to concert a plan,  
to form a more perfect union, eltab-  
Jilh jultice, enfure domeltic tranquil-

cure the bleffings of liberty. The pub-  
lic difqui(itions,difcuflions, anddelibe-  
rathns iflued in the prefent happy  
conllitution of government.  
  
Employed in the fe-rvh e of my coun-  
try abroad during the whole conrfe  
of thefe transactions, 1 firlt faw the  
tonltitution of the Untied Ssates in  
a foreign country. Irritated by no  
Inerary altercation, animated by no»  
public debates, heated by no party a.  
nimolity, I read it with gieat latisfac-  
UOn as the refuLt of good heads,

riment, better adapted to the genius,  
character, fituai ion and relations of  
this nation and country, man any  
which had ever been propofed or f ig-  
gelled. In its general principles t.id  
great outlines, it was conformable to  
fuck a Cjftem of government, as I had  
ever molt elteemed, and in fome Hates,  
my own native Itaie in particular^

#  
  
frevrlutif&#x27;nary war;- supplying the place of govern­  
ment, commanded a degree c.f order, sufficient a&#x27;-,  
feast for the temporary preservation of society. The  
confederation, which was early felt to he necessary  
■was prepared from the models of the. Batavian am  
Helvetick confederacies ; the only examples which  
remain, with any detail and precision, in history :  
and certainly the only ones which the people at larg.  
had ever considered. But reflecting on the striking  
difference, in so many particulars, between thi  
country and those, where a courier may go from th&lt;  
seat of government to the frontier in a single day, it  
was then certainly foreseen, by some who assisted it  
Congress at the formation of it, that it could not b&lt;  
durable.  
“ Negligence of its regulations, inattention to it  
recommendations, if not disobedience to its authc  
rity, not only in individuals but in States, soon ap­  
peared with their melancholv consequences—univei -  
sal languor, jealousies, and&#x27;rivalries of States; de  
dine of navigation and commerce; discouragement  
of necessary manufactures ; universal fall in the va­  
lue of lands and their produce ; contempt of public.}  
and private faith ; loss of consideration and credict  
with foreign nations ; and at length in discontents;  
animosities, combinations, partial conventions, and  
insurrections, threatening some great national cala­  
i mity.  
“ In this dangerous crisis, the people of America  
were not abandoned by their usual good sense, pre­  
I sence of mind, or integrity. Measures were pursued  
to concert a plan, to form a more perfect union,  
establish justice, ensure domestick tranquillity, pro­  
vide for the common defence, promote the general  
welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. The  
publick disquisitions, discussions, and deliberations,  
issued in the present happy constitution of Govern­  
ment.  
u Employed in the service of my country abroad,  
during the whole course of these transactions, I- first  
| saw the Constitution of the United States in a foreign  
country. Irritated by no literary altercations, ani­  
mated by no publick debate, heated by no party ani­  
mosity, I read it with great satisfaction, a* a result  
of good heads, prompted by good hearts ; as an ex­  
periment better adapted to the genius, character,  
situation, and relations of this nation and country,  
than any which had ever been proposed or suggested.  
In its general principles and great outlines, it was  
conformable to such a system of government as I had  
ever most esteemed ; and in some states, my own  
native state in particular, had contributed to esta­  
blish. Claiming a right of suffrage, in common with  
my fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a  
Constitution which was to rule me and my posterity,  
as well as them and theirs, 1 did not hesitate to ex­  
press my approbation of it on all occasions, in pub­  
iick and in private. It was not then, nor has been  
since, any objection to it, in my mind, that the Ex­  
ecutive and Senate were not more permanent. Nor  
have I ever entertained a thought of promoting any  
alteration in it, but such as the people themselves,  
in the course of their experience, should see and  
feel to be necessary or expedient, by their re­  
presentatives in Congress, and the State Legislatures,  
according to the Constitution itself, to adopt and or­  
dain.  
  
nciummg 10 me Dosom or my country, after a  
painful separation from it for ten years, 1 had the  
honour to be elected to a station under the new or*  
der of things; and I have repeatedly laid myself un­  
der the most serious obligations to support the Con­  
stitution. The operation of it has equalled the most  
sanguine expectations of it friends ; and from an ha­  
bitual attention to it, satisfaction in its administration,  
and delight in its effects upon the peace, order, pros­  
perity and happiness of the nation, I have acquired  
&#x27;em habitual attachment to, and veneration for it,  
“ What other form of government indeed can so  
well deserve our esteem and love l  
“ There may be little solidity in an ancient idea,  
that congregations of men into cities and nations, are  
the most pleasing objects in the sight of superiour in­  
telligences ; but this is very certain, that to a bene­  
volent, humane mind, there can be no spectacle pre­  
sented, hy any nation, more pleasing, more noble,  
ntajestick, or august, than an assembly, like that  
which has so often been seen in this and the other  
chamber of Congress, of a government, in which the  
executive authority, as well as that of all the bran­  
ches of the Legislature, are exercised by citizens se­  
lected, at regular periods, by their neighbours, to  
make and execute laws for the general good. Can  
any thing’ essential, any thing more than mere orna­  
ment and decoration, be added to this by robes or  
diamonds f Can authority be more amiable or re­  
spectable, when it descends from accidents, or in­  
  
ntiiuuuiia cM.i&#x27;iinncu hi icmuic ctriinjuriY, iimii wiicii |  
it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an  
honest and enlightened people ? For it is the people  
only that are represented ; it is their power and ma­  
jesty that is reflected, and only for their good, in  
every legitimate government, under whatever form  
it may appear. The existence of such a government  
as ours for any length of time, is a full proof of a ge­  
neral dissemination of virtue throughoat the whole  
body of the people. And what object or considerati­  
on more pleasing than this can be presented to the  
human heart ? If national pride is ever justifiable or  
excuseable, it is when it springs, not from power or  
riches, grancteur or glory, but from conviction of  
national innocence, information, and benevolence.  
“ In the midst of these pleasing ideas, we should be  
unfaithful to ourselves, if we should lose sight of the  
danger to our liberties ; if any thing partial or extra­  
neous should infect the purity of our free, fair, vir­  
tuous, and independent elections. If an election is  
to be determined by a majority of a single vote, and  
that can be procured by a party, through artifice or  
corruption, the government may be the choice of a  
party fo?their own end*, not of the nation, Jor the  
national good. If that solitary suffrage can be oh.  
tained by foreign nations, by flattery or menaces, by  
fraud or violence, by terrour, intrigue, or venality,  
the government may not he the choice of the American  
people, but of foreign nati ms. It may be foreign  
nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who  
govern ourselves. And candid men will acknowledge,  
that, in such cases, choice should have little advan­  
tage to boast of, over lot or chance.  
“ Such is the amiable and interesting system of go­  
vernment (and such are some tf the abuses to which  
it may be exposedJ which the people of America  
have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of  
the wise and virtuous of all nations, for eight year*,  
under the administration of a citizen, who, by a long  
course tf great actions, regulated by prudence, jus­  
tice, temperance, and fortitude; conducting a peo.  
pie inspired by the same virtues, and animated with  
the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty, to  
independanee and peace, to increasing wraith and  
unexampled prosperity; has merited the gratitude  
of his fellow citizens, commanded the highest praises  
Hfforeign nations, and secured immortal glory with  
posterity l  
“ In that retirement which is his voluntary choice,  
may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of  
his services, the gratitude of mandind, the happy  
fruits of them to himself and world, which are daily  
increasing, and that splendid prospect of the future  
fortunes of his country, which Is opening from year  
to year. His name may he still a raittpart; and  
the knowledge that lie lives, a bulwark against all  
open or secret enemies of h» country’s peace.  
“ His example has been recommended to the imi­  
tation of his successors, by both Mouses of Congress,  
sntfbythe voice of the Legislatures and the people  
throughout lbs nation*

«« When it was first perceived in early times, that  
no middie course for America remained, between  
unlimited submission te a foreign legislature, and a  
total independence of itsclaims. mren of reflection  
were less apprehensive of danger, from the formida-  
ble power of fleets and armies, which they must de  
termine to resist than from those contests and dis-  
sentions which would certainly arise, concerning the  
forms of government to be instituted, over the whole,  
and over the parts of this extensive country. Rely-  
ing, however, on the purity of their intentions, the  
justice of their cause, and the integrity and intelli-  
gence of the people, under an over-ruling Providence,  
which had so signally proteced thiscountry from the  
first, the Representatives of this nation, then consist-  
ing of little more than half cheir present number,  
not only broke to pieces the chains which were for-  
ging, and the rod of iron that was lifted up, but  
  
. frankly cat asunderthe ties which had bound them,  
  
and lausched into an ocean of uncertainty.  
“« The zeal and ardour of the people, during the  
revolutionary war, supplying the place of govern-  
| ment, commanded a degree of order, sufficient at  
least forvthe ary preservation of society. The  
confederation, which was early felt to be necessary,  
was prepared from the models of the Batavian and  
Heivetick confederacies ; the only examples which  
remain, with any detail ard precision, in history ;  
  
had ever considered. Byt reflecting on the striking  
difference, in so many particulars, between this  
  
seat of government to the frontier in a single day, it  
was then certainly foreseen, by some who assisted in  
Congress at the formation of it, thar it could not be  
durable.  
  
“ Negligence of itsregulations, inattention to its  
recommendations, if not disobedience to its authori-  
ty, not only in individuals butin States, soon ap-  
peared with their melancholy consequences—univer-  
sal languor, jealousies, and rivalries of States ; de-  
cline of nayigation and commerce ; dicouragement  
of necessary manufactures ; universal fall in the va-  
lue of Jands and their produce ; contempt of public  
and ‘private faith ; loss of Consideration and credit  
with foreign nations ; and at length in discontents,  
animosites, combinations, partial contentions, and  
insurrections, threatening some great national cala-  
mity. -  
  
‘* In this dangerous crisis, the people of America  
wete not abandoned by their usual geod sense, pre.  
sence ot mind, or integrity. Measures were pursued  
to concert a plan, to form a more perfect union, es-  
tablish justice, ensure domestick tranquility, »provide  
for the common defence, promote the general wel-  
fare, and secure the blessings of liberty. The pub-  
lic disquisitions, discussions, and deliberations, is-  
sued in the present happy constitution of Govern-  
ment. ’  
  
‘* Employed in the service of my country abroad,  
during the whole course of these transactions, I first  
saw the Constitution of the United Sates in a for-  
eign country.  
animated by no public debate, heated by no party  
animosity, J read it with great satisfaction ag aresult  
of good heads, prompted by good hearts ; as an experi-  
  
tion, and relatiens of this natton and country, than a-  
ny which had ever been proposed or suggested.  
general principles and great outlines, it was confor-  
  
er mos esteemed ; and in some states my own na-  
tive state in particular, had contributed to estab-  
lish. Claiming a right of suffrage, in common with  
mv fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a  
Constitution which was to rule me and my posterity,  
as well as them and theirs, I did not hesitate to ex-  
press my approbation of it on all occasions, in pub-  
lick and in private. Jt was not then, nor bas been  
since, any objection to it, in my mind, that the Execu-  
tive and Senate were not more permanent. Nor have  
I ever entertained a thought of promoting any al-  
teration in it, but such as the people themse ves, in  
the course of their experrence, should see and  
feel to be necessary orexpedient, by their represen-  
tatives in Congress, amd the State Legislatures, ac-  
cording to the Constitution itself, to adept and or-  
dain.  
  
« Returning te the bosom of my country, after a  
painful separation from it for ten years, I had the  
honour to be elected to a station under the new or-  
| der of things; and I have repearedly laid myself  
&#x27;underthe most serious obligations to support the  
Constitution. The operation of it has equalled the  
| most sanguine expecrations of its friends, and from  
  
an habitual attention to it, satisfaction in its admin-  
istracion, and delight in irs effects upon the peace  
order, prosperity and happiness of the nation, J dave  
acquired an babitual attachment to, and veneration for  
| at.  
«« What other form of government indeed can so  
well deserve our esteem and love !  
| «* ‘Tiere may be little solidity in an ancient idea.

Can any thing essential, more than mere or-  
nament and ation, be added to this by robes or di-  
amonds ? Can authority be more amiable or respect-  
able, when it descends from accidents, or instiru-  
  
tions established in remote antiquity, than “a it  
springs fresh from the hearts and judgmests of an  
honest andenlightened people? For it is  
  
only that are represented ; it is their ma-  
jesty that is ted, and only for their goed. in  
every legitimate government, under whatever form  
  
it may appear. e existence of such a government  
as ours for any length of time, is a full proof of a  
general dissemination of virtuethrouzhou: the whole  
body of the e. _ And what object or considera-  
tion more P sox 2 than this can be presented to the  
human heart? if national pride is ever justifiabe or  
excuseable, itis when it springs, not from power  
| or rickes, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of  
na‘ ional innocence, information, and benevolence.  
  
“ In the midst of these pleasing ideas, we should  
be unfaithful to ourselves, if we should lose sight  
of the danger to our liberties; if ary thing partial or  
extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair,  
virtuous, and independent elections. Ifan election  
is to be determined by a majority of a single vote,  
and that can be procured dy a party, through artifice  
or corruption, 2 emamea may be the choice of a  
party for their own ends, not of the nation, for the na-  
tional good. If that solitary suffrage can be obtain-  
ed by foreign nations, by flattery or menaces, by  
fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the  
government may not be the choice of the American  
people, but of foreign nations. It may be  
nations who govern us, and not we, the people, whe  
govern ourselves. And candid men will acknowl-  
edge, that, in such cases, choice should have little ad-  
vantage to boast of, over lot or chance.  
  
Such is the amiable ard interesting system of go-  
vernment (and such are seme cf the abuses to  
which it may be exposed) which the people of A-  
merica have exhibited to the adnmuration and anxie-  
ty of the wise and virtuous of all nations, for eight  
years, under the administration of a citizen, who, oy  
a long course of great actions, regulated by prudence,  
justice, temperance, and fortitude ; conducting a  
people inspired by the same virtuous and animated  
with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty,  
to independence and peace, to increasing wealth and  
unexampled prosperity ; has merited the gratitude  
of his fellow citizens. commanded the highest prais-

authority be more amiable and respectable when it  
descends from accidents, or institutions established  
intemote antiquity, than when it springs fresh from  
the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlight-  
ened people? For it is the people only that are  
represented. It is their power and majesty that is  
reflected, and only their good is sought in every  
legitimate government, under whatever form it may  
appear. The existence of such a government as ours  
for any length of time is a full proof of a general  
dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout  
the whole body of the people. And what object or  
consideration more pleasing than this can be pre-  
sented to the human mind? If national pride is  
ever justifiable or excusable, it is when it springs,  
not from power or riches, grandeur or glory, but
