Dear Sir  
Monticello  
May 20. 26.  
The subject of your letter of Apr. 20 is one on which I do not permit myself to express an opinion, but when time, place, &amp; occasion may give it some favorable effect. a good cause is often injured more by ill timed efforts of it’s friends than by the arguments of it’s enemies. persuasion, perseverance, and patience are the best advocates on questions depending on the will of others. the revolution in public opinion which this case requires, is not to be expected in a day, or perhaps in an age. but time, which outlives all things, will outlive this evil also. my sentiments have been 40. years before the public. had I repeated them 40. times, they would only have become the more stale and thread-bare. altho I shall not live to see them consummated, they will not die with me. but living or dying they will ever be in my most fervent prayers. this is written for yourself, and not for the public: in compliance with your request of two lines of sentiment on the subject. accept the assurance of my good will and respect.Th: Jefferson

Dear Sune The  
Oth is one on which | do  
press an opinion, but when time, place, and occasion  
may give it some favorable effect. A good cause is  
ofien injured more by ill-timed efforts of its friends,  
than the arguments of its enemies. Persuasion,  
perseverance and patience are the best advocates, de-  
  
vending on the will of the others. The revolution  
in public opinion which this case requires, is not to  
be expected in a day, or perhaps an age ; bat time,  
which outlives all things. wi/l outlive this evil also.  
  
Vy sentiments have been forty years before the |  
pubhe. Had I repeated them forty times, they would |  
only hace become the more stale and thread-bare,  Al-  
though I shall not live to see them consummated, they  
will not die with me; but, living or dying, they will  
he in my most fervent prayers.  
  
This is written for yourself, and not for the pub-  
lie, in compliance with vour request of two lines of  
my sentiment on the subject.  
  
‘Accept the assurance of my good will and re-  
  
Rpect,

MoNricELLo, May 26, 1825.  
DaaR SiR: The subject of your let­  
ter of April 20, is one on which I do  
not permit myself to express an opinion,  
but when time, place and occasion may  
give if some favorable effect. A good  
cause is often injured more by ill timed  
efforts of its friends than by the argu­  
ments of its enemies. Persuasion, per­  
severance and patience are the best  
advocates on questions depending on  
the will of others. The hevolution in  
public opinion which this case requires is  
not to be ewpected in d day or perhaps in  
an age; bat time, which outlives alt things  
will outlive this evil also My sentiments  
have been forly years b fore the public, and  
had I repeated them forty times, they  
would only become the more stale and  
threadbare. Although I shall not live  
to see them consummated, they will not  
die with me, but tiving or dying, they will  
ever be in my most fervent prayers.
