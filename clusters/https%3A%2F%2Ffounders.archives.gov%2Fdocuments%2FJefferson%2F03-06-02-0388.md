onstitution? and, if that has not been made, does it exist the less; there being between generation &amp; generation, as between nation &amp; nation, no other law than that of nature? and is it the less dishonest to do what is wrong, because not expressly prohibited by written law? let us hope that our moral principles are not yet in that stage of degeneracy; and that in instituting the system of finance to be hereafter pursued, we shall adopt the only safe, the only lawful &amp; honest one, of borrowing on such short terms of reimbursement of interest &amp; principal, as  
			 will fall within the accomplishment of our own lives.  
The question will be asked, and ought to be looked at, what is to be the resource, if loans cannot be obtained? there is but one. ‘Carthago delenda est.’ Bank-paper must be suppressed, and the circulating medium  
			 must be restored to the nation to whom it belongs. it is the only fund on which  
			 they can  
			 rely for loans; it is the only resource which  
			 can never fail them; and it is an abundant one for every necessary purpose. treasury bills, bottomed on taxes, bearing, or not bearing interest, as may be found necessary, thrown into  
				circulation,  
			 will take the place of so much gold &amp; silver, which last, when crouded, will find an efflux into other countries, and thus keep the quantum of medium at it’s salutary level. let banks continue if they please; but let them discount for cash alone, or for treasury notes. they discount for cash alone in every other country on earth, except Great Britain, &amp;, her too often unfortunate copyist, the US. if taken in time, they may be rectified by degrees, &amp; without injustice; but if let alone till the alternative forces itself on us, of submission to the enemy for want of funds, or the suppression of bank paper, either by law, or by a convulsion, we cannot foresee how it will end.  
The remaining questions are Mathematical only. how are the taxes &amp; the time of their continuance, to be proportioned to the Sum borrowed, &amp; the stipulated Interest?  
The Rate of interest will depend on the state of the money market; &amp; the duration of the tax on the will
