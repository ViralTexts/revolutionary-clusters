the Governments where they reside if their views are not counteracted by the resident Consul, which at Algiers I presume has never been the case, as it is a Notorious fact that Mr O’Brien has been indefatigable in procuring them an undue influence in our affairs both at Tunis &amp; Tripoli as well as at Algiers, as you have already been informed by my numerous communications since my arrival in Barbary. Prudence however seems to dictate the propriety of our arranging our affairs first with Tripoli, which I hope will be the means of procuring respect at Tunis; if not we must procure it at the mouth of our Cannons, but should we break with the whole of the Barbary States at once, we must have considerably greater force in the Mediterranean; I propose chastising them one at a time &amp; pursuing such measures at the Ottoman Court as will effectually prevent any coalition taking place injurious to our interest. I not only contemplate the obtaining a permanent &amp; honorable peace but likewise the dethroning the present Bashaw &amp; effecting a revolution in favor of his Brother Hamet, who is at Tunis &amp; thereby insure the United States the gratitude of him &amp; his Successors, for so long as Juseph the Bashaw lives our commerce will not be secure. For even allowing that we conclude a peace upon our own terms, the first time our Frigates are off their guard, or employed upon other Service, his cruisers will capture Americans in retaliation for having imposed upon him terms which he may consider humiliating, not reverting to the cause &amp; that the concessions which we will certainly force him to make are merely inflicted as a just punishment for his temerity &amp; breach of faith &amp; to oblige him to observe his engagements inviolably sacred in future.  
I have requested Mr Eaton to endeavour to ascertain how far said Hamet would be willing to engage in an Expedition of that Nature &amp; even should we not succeed in dethroning Juseph nevertheless his presence on board of Commodore Truxton would strike his Brother &amp; adherents with such a panic as could not fail to promote our interests.

ase &amp; many of our Merchants &amp; Captains dispute the Consuls’ authority to detain their Vessels in port, notwithstanding the national consequences of their Capture being fully explain’d to them: I therefore presume that this point merits the immediate determination of Government &amp; that positive instructions ought to be given to all the Consuls in the Mediterranean whether they have power to detain the Vessels of their Nation in port, as the consuls of all other nations have, or whether they are to permit them to sail after being informed of War being declared against us by the Barbary States.
