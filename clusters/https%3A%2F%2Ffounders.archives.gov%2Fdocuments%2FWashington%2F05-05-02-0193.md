United States of America [New York]   
Gentlemen,[c.15 March 1790]   
While I now receive with much satisfaction your congratulations on my being called, by an unanimous vote, to the first station in my Country; I cannot but duly notice your politeness in offering an apology for the unavoidable delay. As that delay has given you an opportunity of realizing, instead of anticipating, the benefits of the general Government; you will do me the justice to believe, that your testimony of the increase of the public prosperity, enhances the pleasure which I should otherwise have experienced from your affectionate address.  
I feel that my conduct, in war and in peace, has met with more general approbation than could reasonably have been expected: and I find myself disposed to consider that fortunate circumstance, in a great degree, resulting from the able support and extraordinary candour of my fellow-citizens of all denominations.  
The prospect of national prosperity now before us is truly animating, and ought to excite the exertions of all good men to establish and secure the happiness of their Country, in the permanent duration of its Freedom and Independence. America, under the smiles of a Divine Providence—the protection of a good Government—and the cultivation of manners, morals and piety, cannot fail of attaining an uncommon degree of eminence, in literature, commerce, agriculture, improvements at home and respectability abroad.  
As mankind become more liberal they will be more apt to allow, that all those who conduct themselves as worthy members of the Community are equally entitled to the protection of civil Government. I hope ever to see America among the foremost nations in examples of justice and liberality. And I presume that your fellow-citizens will not forget the patriotic part which you took in the accomplishment of their Revolution, and the establishment of their Government: or the important assistance which they received from a nation in which the Roman Catholic faith is professed.  
I thank you, Gentlemen, for your kind concern for me. While my life and my health shall continue, in whatever situation I may he, it shall be my constant endeavour to justify the favourable sentiments which you are pleased to express of my conduct. And may the members of your Society in America, animated alone by the pure spirit of Christianity, and still conducting themselves as the faithful subjects of our free Government, enjoy every temporal and spiritual felicity.

that your testimony of the increase of public prosperity,  
enhances the pleasure which I should otherwise

1 feel that my conduct in war and in peace lias met

have been expected; and 1 find myself disposed to consider  
that fortunate circumstance in a great degree, rc- .

country and lire permanent duration of its freedom and |

cultivation of manners, morals and piety, cannot faii of!  
attaining an uncommon degree of eminence, in literature,  
commerce, agriculture, improvements at home and ,

trill not forget the /&#x27;ulriotic port tr/ii- h ynu took in the accomplishment  
of their Revolution, and the establishment of  
their Government, of tbo important assistance which they  
received from a nation in which the Roman Catholic  
faith is professed.  
1 thank you, gentlemen, for your kind concern for me.  
While my life and my health shall continue, in whatever |  
situation I may bp, it siiuli be my constant endeavor to i  
justify the favorable sentiments which you are pleased !

Gestlenen. While I now receive with much sat­  
on your congratulations on my being called by  
a unanimous vote to the first station in my country, I  
canr of but duly notice your politeness in offering an  
ayolegy for the unavoidable delay. As that delay  
en you an opportunity of rea izing, instead of  
ant cip aririg, the bene fits of the General Government,  
 you will do me the justice to believe that your test­  
 meny to the increase of the public prosperity enhances  
the ple asure which I should otherwise have experi  
 enced from your affectionate address.  
I feel that my conduct in war and in peace has met  
 with more general approbation than coild reasonably  
have bern expected, and I find myself disposed to  
 consider that fortunate circumstance in a or  
give resulting from the able support andextraordinary  
cendor of my fellow-citizens of all denominations.  
The prospect of national prosperity nov before us  
is truly animating, and ought to excite the en  
of all good men to estabiish and secure the happiness  
of their country in the permanent duration of its free  
America, under the smiles  
 of divire Providence, the protection of a good govern­  
ment, the cultivetion of manners, morals and piety,  
cean sardly fail of attaining an uncommon degree of  
eminence in literature, commerce, agricultu  
provements at I ome and respectability abroad.  
As mankind become more liberal, they will be mors  
ept to eilow, that all those who conduct the  
as worthy members of the community are equally en-­  
titled to the protection of civil government. I hope  
ever to see America among the foremost nation in ex­  
and liberality. And I presu ne that  
ow-citizens will not forget the patriotic part  
which you took in the accomplishment of their ravo  
lution and the establishment of their Governm  
oriant assistance which they received from a

While my life and my health shall continue, in  
whatever situation I may be, it shall be my constant  
endeavor to justify the favorable sentiments you are

of the United States. He responded as fol­  
lows: I-  
. . . .&#x27;. ;. ; . DeceusC,&#x27; 2, 1789.  
Gentlemen While . I now receive with  
much Satisfaction your congratulations on  
my being called by a unanimous vote to the  
first station in, my country, I cannot but du­  
ly notice your politeness jn offering an apol­  
ogy for the unavoidable delay. As that de  
lay has1 given you an opportunity of realiz  
ing, instead of anttcipatin g, the benefits of  
the General Government, you will do me  
the justice to believe that your testimony to  
the increase of the public prosperity en­  
hances the pleasure which I should other­  
wise have experienced from your affection­  
ate address. .7  
I feel that my conduct in war and in  
peace has met with more general approba­  
tion than could reasonably have been ex­  
pected; and I find, myself disposed to con  
sider that fortunate circumstance , in a great  
degree resulting from the able support and  
extraordinary candor of my fellow-citizens  
of. all denominations. , .  
The prospect of national prosperity now  
before us is truly animating, and ought to  
excite the exertions of all good men to es­  
tablish and secure their country in the per­  
manent duration of its freedom and inde  
pendence. America, under the smiles of  
Divine Providence, the protection of a good  
Government, the cultivation of manners,  
morals and piety, can hardly fail of attain  
ing an uncommon degree of eminence in  
literature, commerce, agriculture, improve­  
ments at home and respectibility abroad.  
As mankind become more liberal, they  
will be more apt to allow, that all those  
who conduct themselves as worthy mem  
bers of the community are equally entitled  
to the protections of civil government. I  
hope ever to see &#x27; America among foremost  
nations in examples of justice and liberali  
ty. And I presume that yourfellow-citi-zens  
will not forget the patriotic part which  
you took in the accomplishment of their  
revolution and the establishment of theij  
Government, or the important assistance  
which they received from a nation (France)  
in which the Kornan Catholic religion is  
professed.  
I thank you,&#x27;, gentlelnen, for your kind  
concern lor me. wiuie my nte anu my  
ulth shall continue,, in whatever situation  
I may be, it shall be my constant endeavor  
to justify the favorable sentiments you are  
pleased to cxpress&#x27;.&#x27;of &#x27; my conduct. And

 America.  
GENeLENEN: While I now receive with much  
satisfretion your Congratulations on my being  
called, by a unanimous vote, to the first station in  
the country, I cannot but duly notice your ponte­  
ness, in offering an apology for the unavoidable  
delay. As that delay has given you an opportuni  
ty of realizing, instead of anticipatins the ben f  
the general Government, you will do me the justice  
to believe that your testimony of the mheleass  
the public prosperity, enhances the pleasure which  
I should otherwise have experienced from your  
affectionate a ddress.  
I feel that my conduct, in war and in peace, has  
met with more general approbation than could have  
ably been expected; and I find myself dis  
posed to consider that fortunate circumstance, in a  
great degree, resulting fron the able support, and  
extraordinary candor, of my fellow citizens of all  
denomina ions.  
The prospect of national prosperity now before  
us is truly animating, and ought to excite the ex-  
e a e  
ertions of all good men, to estaonsn and secute  
the happiness of the country, in the permanent  
duration of its freedom and independence. Amer­  
ica, under the smiles of Divine Providence, the  
protection of a good government, and the cultiva­  
tion of manners, morals, and piety, cannot fail to  
attain an uncommon degree of eminence in liter­  
ature, commerce, agriculture, improvements at  
home and respectability abroad.  
As mankind become more liberal, they will be  
more apt to allow, that all those who conduct them­  
selves as torthy members of the community, are  
equally entitled to the protection of civit government.  
I hope ever to see America foremost in examples  
of justice and liberality. And I presume your  
fellow citizens will not forget the patriotic part  
which you took in the accomplishment of their  
revolution, and the establishment of their govern­  
ment or the important assistance which they re  
ceived from a nation in which the Roman Ca tholic  
faith is professed.  
I thank you, gentleman, for your kind concern  
for me. While my life and my health shall con  
tinue, in whatever situation I may be, it shall be  
my constant endeavor to justify the favorable sen  
timents which you are pleased to express of my  
conduct. And may the members of your society  
in America, animated alone by the pure spirit of  
ee endotiu thosonelges an th  
Christianity, and still conductins themselves as the  
faithful subjects of our government, enjoy every  
temporal and spiritual felicity.

Again, Washington, in his address to the

you took in the accomplishment of then

&quot;I thank you, gentlemen, for your kind  
concern for me. While my life and health  
shall continue, in whatever situation I may  
be, it shall be my constant endeavor to juss

being called, by an unanimous vote, to the first station in my country, I cannot but  
duly notice your politeness in offering an apology for the unavoidable delay. As that  
delay has given you an opportunity of realizing, instead of anticipating, the benefits of  
the general government, you will do me the justice to believe that your testimony of the  
increase of public prosperity, enhances the pleasure which I should otherwise have  
experienced from your affectionate Address. I feel that my conduct in war and in peace,  
has met with more general approbation than could reasonably be expected; and I find  
myself disposed to consider that fortunate circumstance in a great degree resulting from  
the able support and extraordinary candor of my fellow-citizens of all denominations.  
While my life and health shall continue, in whatever situation I may be, it shall be my  
constant endeavor to justify the favorable sentiments which you are pleased to express  
of my conduct. So, gentlemen, I thank you. G. Wasuineron.

December, 1789.  
Gentlemen: Whilo I now receive with much  
satisfaction your congratulations on my being  
called by a unanimous voto to tbe first station  
in my country, I cannot bnt dnly notice your po­  
liteness in oQering an apology for the unavoida­  
ble delay. As that delay has given you an op­  
portunity of realizing instead of anticipating tbe  
benefits of tbe General Government, yon will do  
me tbe justice to believe that your testimony to  
tho increase of the pnblic prosperity enhances tbe  
pleasure which I should otherwisp have experi­  
enced from your affectionato address.  
I feel that my condnct in war and iu peaco has  
met with more general approbation than conld  
reasonably have been expected ; and I find myself  
disposed to consider that fortunate circumstance  
in a great degrco resulting from tho able support  
and extraordinary candor of my fellow-citizens  
of all denominations.  
The prospect of national prosperity now before  
ns is truly animating, and ought to excite the  
exertions of all good men to establish and secure  
the hanniness of their country in the permanent  
duration of its freedom and independence. Amer­  
ica, under the smiles of divine Providence, the  
protection of a good government, the cnlti vation  
of manners, morals and piety, can hardly fail of  
attaining an uncommon degree of eminence in  
literature, commerce, agriculture, improvements  
at home, aud respectability abroad.  
As mankind become more liberal, they will be  
more apt to allow, that all those who condnct  
themselves as worthy members of the communi­  
ty are equally entitled to the protection of civil  
government. I hopo ever to see America among  
the formost nations in examples of jnstice and  
liberality. And I presume that yourfellow-citizens  
will not forget the patriotic part you took  
in their revolution, and the establishment of their  
Government, or the important assistance which  
thev received from a nation in which the Roman  
Catholic religion is professed.  
I thank you, gentlemen, for your kind concern  
for me. While iny life and my health shall con­  
tinue, in whatever situation I may be, it shall be  
my constant endeavor Jo justify the favorable  
sentiments you aro pleased to express of my con­  
dnct. And may the members of yonr Society in  
America, animated alone by tbe pure spirit of  
Christianity, and still conducting themselves as  
the futlifnl subjects of our free Government, en­  
joy every temporal aud spiritual felicity.

As mankind becomes moro liberal ,
