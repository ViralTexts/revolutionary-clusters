The law, by which the prisoners are to be tried, is a law of mercy— a law applying to us all—a law, judge Blackstone will tell us “founded in principles, that are permanent, uniform and universal, always conformable to the feelings of humanity and the indelible rights of mankind.” Sec 4, 13.

ted by the British parliament, which gave a general alarm to this continent. Measures were alternately taken, in Great Britain, that awakened jealosy, resentment, fortitude and vigilance. Affairs continued long fluctuating. A sentiment universal prevailed, that our dearest rights were invaded. It is not our business here to enquire touching these delicate points. These are concernments, which however interesting or important in themselves, we must keep far away from us, when in a Court of law. It poisons justice, when politics tinctures it’s current.  
I need not inform you, how the tide rose, as we were advancing towards the present times. The general attention became more and more roused—people became more alike in opinion and practice. A vast majority thought all that was dear was at stake—sentiments of liberty, property, ignominious bondage, all conspire to encrease the ferment. At this period, the troops land.

s on your hearts. You will not suspect him of being unfriendly to liberty; if this cause and it’s event must, at all hazards, be held as interwoven with a matter so foreign to it. I allude to the third Letter of the FARMER of Pennsylvania to his countrymen.  
“The cause of liberty, says that great and good writer, is a cause of too much dignity, to be sullied by turbulence and tumult. It ought to be maintained in a manner suitable to her nature. Those who engage in it, should breathe a sedate, yet fervent spirit, animating them to ac­  
  
  
  
  
  
  
tions of prudence, justice, modesty, bravery, humanity, and magnanimity.”  
What has there transpired on this trial, favouring of any of these virtues? Was it justice or humanity to attack, insult, ridicule and abuse a single Sentinel on his post? Was it either modest, brave or magnanimous to rush upon the points of fixed bayonets; and trifle, vapour, and provoke at the very mouths of loaded muskets. It may be brutal rage, or wanton rashness, but not surely any true magnanimity.  
“I hope, says the same eminent writer, my dear countrymen, that you will in every colony be upon your guard against those, who AT ANY TIME endeavour to stir you up, under pretences of patriotism, to any measures DISRESPECTFUL to your Sovereign and our mother country.” By this it should seem, as though the Farmer never expected any period would arrive, when such measures would be warrantable. Now what more disrespectful to our parent country, than to treat with contempt a body of men stationed most certainly by the consent of her supreme legislative, the parliament of Britain? What more disrespectful of our common sovereign, than to assume the sword of justice, and become the avengers of either public or private wrongs? Tho’ the soldiers, who appeared in the earlier part of the evening, in Cornhill, acted like barbarians and savages, they had now retired, and were now confined in their barracks: what tho’ an impertinent boy had received unjustifiable correction from the Sentinel; the boy, and the persons in Cornhill, must have recourse only to the law for th

what more disrespectful to our parent country than to treat with contempt a  
body ot men stationed by the consent of her supreme legislature and the par-
