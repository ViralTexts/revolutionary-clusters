I can read by candlelight only, and stealing long hours from my rest; nor would that time be allowed me indulged to me, could I, by that light, see to write from sun-rise to one or two oclock, and often from dinner to dark, I am drudging at the writing table. and all this to answer letters into which neither interest nor inclination on my part enters; and often for persons whose names I have never before heard. yet, writing civilly, it is hard to refuse them civil answers. this is the burthen of my life, a very grievous one indeed, and one which I must get rid

“ A person inquired of me,” said President Jefferson, “if he might consider as authen-  
tic the change in my religion so much spoken of in some circles. Now, this supposes that  
they knew what had been my religion before, taking for it the word of their priests, whom  
I certainly never made the confidants of my creed. My answer was, say nothing of my

and is to be sought for in my life; if that has been honest and dutiful to society, the reli-
