. 14. 15.  
Your letter of Aug. 14. has been recieved and read again &amp; again with extraordinary pleasure. it is the first glimpse which has been furnished me of the interior workings of the late unexpected, but fortunate revolution of your country. the newspapers told us only that the great beast was fallen; but what part in this the patriots acted, and what the egoists, whether the former slept while the latter were awake to their own interests only, the hireling scribblers of the English press said little, and knew less. I see now the mortifying alternative under which the patriot there is placed, of being either silent, or disgraced by an association in opposition with the remains of Bonapartyism. a full measure of liberty is not now perhaps to be expected by your nation; nor am I confident they are prepared to preserve it. more than a generation will be requisite, under the administration of reasonable laws favoring the progress of knolege in the general mass of the people, and their habituation to an independant security of person and property, before they will be capable of estimating the value of freedom, and the necessity of a sacred adherence to the principles on which it rests for preservation. instead of that liberty which takes root and growth in the progress of reason, if recovered by mere force or accident, it becomes, with an unprepared people, a tyranny still, of the many, the few, or the one.possibly you may remember, at the date of the jeu de paume, how earnestly I urged yourself, and the patriots of my acquaintance, to enter then into a compact with the king, securing freedom of religion, freedom of the press, trial by jury, Habeas corpus, &amp; a national legislature, all of which it was known he would then yield; to go home, and let these work on on the amelioration of the condition of the people, until it they should have rendered them capable of more, when occasions would not fail to arise for communicating to them more. this was as much as I then thought them able to bear soberly &amp; usefully for themselves. you thought otherwise, and that the dose might still be larger. and I found you were right; for subsequent events proved they were equal to the constitution of 1791. unfortunately some of the most honest and enlightened of our patriotic friends, (but closet politicians merely, unpracticed in the knolege of man) thought more could still be obtained &amp; borne. they did not weigh the hazards of a transition from one form of government to another, the value of what they had already rescued from those hazards, and might hold in security if they pleased, nor the imprudence of giving up the certainty of such a degree of liberty, under a limited monarch, for the uncertainty of a little more under the form of a republic. you differed from them. you were for stopping there, and for securing the constitution which the National Assembly had obtained. here too you were right; and from this fatal error of the republicans, from their separation from yourself &amp; the Constitutionalists in their councils, flowed all the subsequent sufferings and crimes of the French nation. the hazards of a second change fell upon them by the way. the foreigner gained time to anarchize by gold the government he could not overthrow by arms, to crush in their own councils the genuine republicans, by the fraternal embraces of exaggerated and hired pretenders, and to turn the machine of jacobinism from the change, to the destruction, of order: and, in the end, the limited monarchy they had secured was exchanged for the unprincipled and bloody tyranny of Robespierre, and the equally unprincipled and maniac tyranny of Bonaparte. you are now rid of him, and I sincerely wish you may continue so. but this may depend on the wisdom &amp; moderation of the restored dynasty. it is for them now to read a lesson in the fatal errors of the republicans; to be contented with a certain portion of power, secured by formal compact with the nation, rather than, grasping at more, hazard all upon uncertainty, and risk meeting the fate of their predecessor, or a renewal of their own exile. we are just

willingly, they would never be at peace. the British ministers find, in a state of war rather than of peace, by riding the various contractors, and recieving douceurs on the vast expenditures of the war-supplies, that they recruit their broken fortunes, or make new ones, and therefore will not make peace, as long as, by any delusions they can keep the temper of the nation up to the war-point.they found some hopes on the state of our finances. it is true that the excess of our banking institutions, and their present discredit, has shut  us out from the best source of credit we could ever command with certainty. but the foundations of credit still remain to us, and need but skill, which experience will soon produce, to marshal them into an order which may carry us thro’ any length of war. but they have hoped more in their Hartford convention. their fears of republican France being now done away, they are directed to republican America, and they are playing the same game for disorganization here which they played in your country. the Marats, the Dantons &amp; Robespierres of Massachusets are in the same pay, under the same orders, and making the same efforts to anarchize us, as their prototypes in France were. I do not say that all who met at Hartford were under the same motives of money: nor were those of France. some of them are Outs, and wish to be Ins; some the mere dupes of the Agitators, or of their own party passions; while the Maratists alone are in the real secret. but they have very different materials to work on. the yeomanry of the  US. are not the Canaille of Paris. we might safely give them leave to go thro’ the US. recruiting their ranks, and I am satisfied they could not raise one single regiment (gambling merchants and silk stocking clerks excepted) who would support them in any effort to separate from the union. the cement of this union is in the heart blood of every American. I do not believe there is on earth a government established on so immovable a basis. let them, in any state, even in Massachusets itself, raise the standard of Separation, and it’s citizens will rise in mass, and do justice themselves on their own incendiaries. if they could have induced the government to some effort of suppression, or even to enter into discussion with them, it would have given them some importance, have brought them into some notice. but they have not been able to make themselves even a subject of conversation, either of public or private societies. a silent contempt has been the sole notice they could excite; consoled indeed, some of them, by the palpable favors of Philip.have then no fears for us, my friend. the grounds of these exist only in English newspapers, credited or endowed by the Castlereaghs or the Cannings, or some other such models of pure &amp; uncorrupted virtue. their military heroes may by land and sea, may sink our oyster boats, rob our henroosts, burn our negro huts and run off. but a campaign or two more will relieve them from further trouble or expence in defending their American possessions.

P.S. Feb. 26. 15. my letter had not yet been sealed when I recieved news of our peace. I am glad of it, and especially that we closed our war, with the eclat of the action at New Orleans. but I consider it as an armistice only, because no security is provided against the impressment of our seamen. while this is unsettled we are in hostility of mind with England, altho actual deeds of arms may be suspended by a truce. if she thinks the exercise of this outrage is worth eternal war, eternal war it must be, or extermination of the one or the other party. the first act of impressment she commits on an American will be answered by reprisal, or by a declaration of war here, and the interval must be merely a state of preparation for it. in this we have much to do, in further fortifying our seaport towns, providing military stores, classing and disciplining our militia, arranging our financial system, and above all pushing our domestic manufactures, which have taken such root as never again can be shaken. once more god

“ My Dear Friend,—Y our letter of August the  
14th has been received and read, again and  
again, with extraordi pleasure. It is the  
first glimpse which has beén furnished me of  
the interior workings of the late unexpected but  
fortunate revolution of your country. The news-  
_ told us only that the great beast was  
  
len; but what part in this the patriots acted,  
and what the egoists, whether the former slept  
while the latter were awake to their own inter-  
ests only, the hireling scribblers of the English  
press said little, and knew less. I see now the  
mortifying alternative under which the patriot  
aane 4 pope de being either silent, or dis-  
  
an tion in opposition with the  
temains of Buonaparteism. A full measure of  
  
we  
  
  
  
liberty is not now perhaps to be expected by  
your nation; nor am I confident they are pre-  
pared to preserve it. More than a generation  
will be requisite, under the administration of  
reasonable laws, favouring the progress of know-  
ledge in the general mass of the people, and  
their habituation to an independent security of  
person and property, before they will be capable  
of estimating the value of freedom, and the ne-  
cessity of a sacred adherence to the principles  
on which it rests for preservation. Instead of  
that liberty which takes root and growth in the  
progress of reason, if recovered by mere force or  
accident, it becomes, with an unprepared people,  
a tyranny still, of the many, the few, or the one.  
Possibly you may remember, at the date of the  
jeu de paume, how earnestly I urged yourself  
and the patriots of my acquaintance, to enter  
then into a compact with the king, securing  
freedom of religion, freedom of the press, trial  
by jury, habeas corpus, and a national legislature,  
all of which it was known he would then yield,  
to go home, and let these work on the ameliora-  
tion of the condition of the people, until they  
should have rendered them capable of more,  
when occasions would not fail to arise for com-  
municating to them more. This was as much  
as I then thought them able to bear, soberly and  
usefully for themselves. You thought otherwise,  
and that the dose might still be larger. And I  
found you were fight; for subsequent events  
proved they were equal to the constitution of  
1791. Unfortunately, some of the most honest  
and enlightened of our patriotic friends, (but  
closet politicians merely, unpractised in the  
knowledge of man,) thought more could still be  
obtained and borne. They did not weigh the  
hazards of a transition from one form of govern-  
ment to another, the value of what they had al-  
ready rescued from those hazards, and might  
hold in security if they pleased, nor the impru-  
dence of giving up the certainty of such a de-  
gree of liberty, under a limited monarch, for  
the uncertainty of a little more under the form  
ofa republic. You differed from them. You  
were for stopping there, arfd for securing. the  
constitution which the National Assembly had  
obtained. Here, too, you were right; and from  
this fatal error of the republicans, from their  
separation from yourself and the constitution-  
alists in their councils, flowed all the subsequent  
sufferings and crimes of the French nation. The  
hazards of a second change fell upon them by  
the way. The foreigner gained time to anar-  
chise by gold the government he could not over-  
throw by arms, to crush in their own councils  
the genuine republicans, by the fraternal em-  
braces of exaggerated and hireling pretenders,  
and to turn the machine of Jacobinism from the  
change to the destruction of order: and, in the  
end, the limited monarchy they had secured was  
exchanged for the unprincipled and bloody ty-  
ranny of Robespierre, and the equally unprin-  
cipled and maniac tyranny of Buonaparte. You  
are now rid of him, and I sincerely wish you  
may continue so. But this may depend on the  
wisdom and moderation of the restored dynasty.  
It is for them now to read a lesson in the fatal  
errors of the republicans ; to be contented with  
a certain portion of power, secured by formal  
compact with the nation, rather than, graspi  
at more, hazard all upon uncertainty, and ri  
meeting the fate of their predecessor, or a re-  
newal of their own exile.” vol. iv. p. 253-4,

‘A full measure of liberty is not now perhaps to be expected by your  
nation ; nor am I confident they are prepared to preserve it. More than  
a generation will be requisite, under the administration of reasonable  
laws, favouring the progress of knowledge in the general mass of the  
people, and their habituation to an independent security of person and pro-  
perty, before they will be capable of estimating the value of freedom, and  
the necessity of a sacred adherence to the principles on which it rests for  
preservation. Instead of that liberty which takes root and growth in the  
progress of reason, if recovered by mere force or accident, it becomes, with  
an unprepared people, a tyranny still, of the many, the few, or the one.  
Possibly you may remember, at the date of the jeu de paume, how ear-  
nestly I urged yourself and the patriots of my acquaintance, to enter then  
into a compact with the King, securing freedom of religion, freedom of  
the press, trial by jury, habeas corpus, and a national legislature, all of  
which it was known he would then yield ; to go home, and let these work  
on the amelioration of the condition of the people, until they should have  
rendered them capable of more, when occasions would not fail to arise  
for communicating to them more. This was as much as I then thought  
them able to bear, soberly and usefully for themselves. You thought  
otherwise, and that the dose might still be larger. And I found you  
were right ; for subsequent events proved they were equal to the consti-  
tution of 1791. Unfortunately, some of the most honest and enlightened  
of our patriotic friends (but closet politicians merely, unpractised in the  
knowledge of man) thought more could still be obtained and borne.  
They did not weigh the hazards of a transition from one form of govern-  
ment to another, the value of what they had already rescued from those  
hazards, and might hold in security if they pleased ; nor the imprudence  
of giving up the certainty of such a degree of liberty, under a limited mo-  
narch, for the uncertainty of a little more under the form of a republic.  
You differed from them. You were for stopping there, and for securing  
the constitution which the National Assembly had obtained. Here, too,  
you were right ; and from this fatal error of the republicans, from their  
separation from yourself and the constitutionalists in their councils, flow-  
ed all the subsequent sufferings and crimes of the French nation. The  
hazards of a second change fell upon them by the way. The foreigner  
gained time to anarchise by gold the government he could not overthrow  
by arms; to crush in their own councils the genuine republicans, by the  
fraternal embraces of exaggerated and hireling pretenders, and to turn  
the machine of Jacobinism from the change to the destruction of order ;  
and, in the end, the limited monarchy they had secured was exchanged  
for the unprincipled and bloody tyranny of Robespierre, and the equally  
unprincipled and maniac tyranny of Buonaparte. —(Vol. iv. pp. 253-4.)

 They found some hopes on the state of our fi­

institutions, and their present discredit, have shut us  
 out from the best source of credit we could ever

credit still remain to us, and need but skill, which

*&lt;T donot say that all who met at Hartford were under tie  
same motives of money, nor were those of France. Some  
of them are outs, and wish to be ins; some the mere  
dupes of the agitators, or of their own party passions, while  
the Maratists alone are in the real secret; but they have  
very different materials to work on. The yeomanry of the  
United States are not the canaille of Paris. We might safely  
give them leave to go through the United States recruiting  
their ranks, and I am satisfied they could not raise one sit-  
gle regiment (gambling merchants and silk-stocking cicrks  
excepted) who would support them in any effort to separate  
from the Union. The cement of this Union is in the heart  
blood of every American. I do not believe there ison earth a  
Government established on so immovable a basis. Let them,  
in any State, even in Massachusetts itself, raise the stand-  
ard of separation, and its citizens will rise in mass and do  
justice themselves on their own incendiaries. If they could  
have induced the Government to some effort of suppres-  
sion, or even to enter into discussion with them, it would  
have given them some importance, have brought ther into  
some notice. But they have not been able to make them-

selves even a subject of conversation, either of public or  
private societies. A silent contempt has been the sole no  
tice they excite ; consoled, indeed, some of them, by the  
palpable favors of Philip. Have, then, no fears for us,my  
triend. The grounds of these exist only in English news-  
papers, edited or endowed by the Castlereaghs or the Can-  
nings, or some other such modeis of pure and uncorrupted  
virtue. Their military heroes, by land and sea, may sink  
our oyster boats, rob our hen-roosts, burn our negro huts,  
and run off ; but a campaign or two more will relieve them  
from further trouble or expense in defending their Amer-  
ican possessions.”  
  
Sir, this was the opinion of Jefferson in relation  
to the scheme of secession when started in the  
North, and this was the opinion he expressed of

In a letter to Lafayette, dated February II,  
1851, he said:  
The cement of this Union is in the heart blood  
of every American. I do not believe there is on  
carte a Goveinment establi-hed on so immovable  
basis. Let them in any State, even in Massa­  
chusetts itsell, rarse the standurd of rebeltion, and  
its eit zens will rise en musse, and do justice them  
selves on their own incendiaries.&quot;  
It will be seen therefore, says the Intelligencer,  
that sectional discontents and threats of disunion,  
however lamentable in their causes or in their ef  
leets, are not novelties in our political history,  
and that the remedy prescribed for their cure by  
Mr. Jerreasn and otheys has hitherto proved ef
