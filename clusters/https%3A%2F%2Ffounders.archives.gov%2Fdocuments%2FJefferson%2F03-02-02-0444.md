ar Sir;  
Blue-Ridge, vicinity of Paris, Virginia,   
July 13th, 1810.  
  
  
		  As you take much interest in the knowledge of every thing relative to the american Mammouth, and other similar animals, I am persuaded that you will be glad to learn, that I have recently received from St. Petersburgh in Russia, some fine large drawings of the great Asiatic Mammouth, whose skeleton, together with some portions of the skin and muscular parts, has lately been discovered, in a state of f excellent preservation, under vast masses of ice, near the mouth of the river Lena, in latitude 72° North. For  
			 this, to me inestimable, present, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr Tilesius, an eminent naturalist, by whom the drawings were made, and who has, at the same time, favoured me with some important manuscript observations concerning the animal.  
  
		    
		    
		  I need not tell you, that this Asiatic Mammouth is specifically distinct from the great Mammouth of North-america; that whose bones have been discovered in so many parts of our continent, and that of which Mr Peale has mounted the skeleton, in his museum. The two  
			 animals are specifically distinct, though I am very far from thinking them generically so. But the Asiatic mammouth has, at some former period, been a native of America, as well as of Asia, and of Europe.   
			 The grinding teeth,  
			 the  
			 incisors (or tusks), and other bones of this animal, have been discovered in several different parts of the United States, &amp;c. as in Pennsylvania, in the river Susquehanna, a branch of which, as I have elsewhere shown, receives its name of “Chemung” from the incisors of one of these huge animals.  
			   
			    
			   
			 Similar remains have  
			 been  
			 discovered in the county of Wythe, in this State; in the same muriatic lick along with the remains of the other mammouth, or what I will call, for the present, the Ohio-mammouth: in South-Carolina, in digging the Santee-canal; in Kentuckey, and doubtless, in many other places, some of which I could mention.  
		  —I  
			 had long suspected, and  even asserted, that the  
			 mammouth of the Chemung was the same as that of Siberia: and  
			 this matter is now put beyond all doubt by the drawings and information communicated to me by Mr   
Tilesius.  
  
  
  
At least one species of Elephant, therefore (for it is by all naturalists allowed, that the asiatic mammouth was a legitimate species of Elephas), has been a native both of the old and of the new world. I am inclined, however, to think, that the species has never been so common in America as in Asia, from whence, therefore, I venture to conjecture, that the stock originally proceeded. It is too soon, however, in the more cautious and sober discussions of natural history, to press  
			 forward such conjectures as these. We have just begun the study of the natural history of our country. Future researches and discoveries may render it at least highly probable, that the Asiatic  
			 mammouth, as we now call it, was once as common in North-america, as in any part of the old-world.—Permit me to add, that I am daily put in possession of facts which prove, that our continent and  
			 Asia have had, and still continue to have, in common, many species of animals and vegetables, in all essential points the same.  
Mr Tilesius’s drawings are of great importance to me: and they came, unasked and even unlooked for, almost at the very time that I was busily occupied in superintending a drawing of the skeleton in the  
			 museum, and in putting together my materials, the fruit of many years research, concerning the Ohio-animal.  
			 The two animals, it is true, are very different from each other: but they have,  
			 nevertheless, great and interesting affinities to each other. The affinities are such, that I cannot consent to consider the American animal as any thing but a species of Elephant. I know, indeed, that Mr Cuvier is now of opinion, that the Ohio-bones bespeak an animal generically different from the elephant. But  
			 although this naturalist’s authority is deservedly high, and of great weight, I am disposed to adhere to my own opinion, and to consider the ohio-mammouth  
			 as belonging to the same genus, or family, as the two or three still existing species of Elephant, and as the great extinct mammouth of the north of asia and of Europe: the Elephas primigenius of Blumenbach: or, as we, in america, may name it, to distinguish it from the ohio-elephant, the “Chemung-Mammouth.”  
Although in the general form of the molares, or grinders, there is a much greater affinity between the asiatic mammouth and the existing asiatic elephant, than there is between either of these latter animals and the Ohio-mammouth, yet there are several other characters in which the resemblance is much closer between the Ohio animal and the extinct asiatic mammouth, than between this latter and the living   
elephant of Asia. I shall only, at present, mention one of these characters; that of the incisors, or defences, which we call tusks. These in the Ohio-mammouth and in the elephas primigenius, or Chemung mammouth, are, indeed, very similar, both in their relative proportion to the general mass of the  
			 skeleton of the two animals, and in their degrees of curvature.  
  
On the other hand, the ohio-mammouth and the living asiatic elephant seem to have been more nearly allied to each other, in the form of their feet than were the latter animal and the extinct Asiatic mammouth: i.e, the Chemung mammouth. When Mr Tilesius shall publish his history and drawings of the elephas primigenius, and when the history of the Elephas mastodontus shall be completed, every intelligent and candid naturalist will be forcibly struck with  
			 the circumstances which I have mentioned: and I flatter myself, that some of the most learned of these naturalists, and among others my candid and liberal friend Tilesius, will not refuse their assent to my opinion, that the mammouth of the ohio has been a true species of elephant.  
Mr Tilesius’s drawings are important to me in another point of view. They plainly show, I think, what has been the natural direction of the incisors in the head of the Ohio-mammouth. Indeed, previously to the receipt of these drawings, I had satisfied my mind as to this point, from the information which I had  
			 received from an intelligent correspondent, who had had an opportunity of seeing the incisors still occupying their original position in the head of a mammouth which was discovered,   
not a few years since, in one of our western muriatic licks, or salines.  
As to the form of the grinders, and the disposition of the vitreous body, or enamel, upon and through them, I grant that it is very different in the ohio-mammouth and in the extinct as well as existing elephants of the old world. But if this difference be of sufficient importance to constitute a difference of genus between the american and Asiatic animals, then we must proceed consistently to break up several of the long established genera of mammalia, subdividing each genus into at least two distinct genera genera. I may mention the genus Marmot, to which belongs our Ground-Hog, or Monack, as illustrative of this idea.—I shall call the ohio mammouth, Elephas Mastodontus. It is the Elephas Americanus of Mr Blumenbach.  
I have nearly prepared, and shall shortly present to our Philosophical Society, an extensive memoir on the extinction of the species of mammalia. This memoir will necessarily contain much matter merely of a speculative nature: but I flatter myself that it will also contain some interesting, and hitherto unnoticed facts.   
  
I shall be much gratified if this letter, written among the mountains of your State, at a distance from my books and papers, afford you any amusement. Of all the subjects of animal natural history, there is not one more interesting than that which relates to the characters and history of those vast organized bodies,—many of them, too, endowed with an immense portion of intelligence,—which the God of Nature had created; and after suffering them to grow and exist throu through ages, unknown ages, of time, has, at length, entirely removed from the earth; not merely as individuals, but as species. There is something awful in the consideration of this subject: and yet this very subject is admirably calculated to display to us the wisdom, as well as power, of him who formed all  
			 things. The harmony of nature is not, in the smallest degree, disturbed by the total destruction of what many have deemed necessary integral parts of a common whole. Nor is this business of the extinction of species at an End. That which has already taken place, with respect to species of Elephants, Rhinoceros, and other vast families of animals, will unquestionably take place, with respect to many of the families of animals which now cover the surface of this globe. The steps of this  
			 vast and generally unlooked for change, are rapidly preparing, in different parts of the world; and in none, I think, more rapidly than in that portion of it which we inhabit.  
  
I am, Dear Sir, with very great respect Your obedient servant, &amp;c., &amp;c.,

Pea* Swt—As yoo tak^mucb interest in the  
knoolidge of every thing relative to the American  
  
Mammoth, and other similar. animats, I am per­  
•oaded that yon will b« glad to learn, that I have re­  
cently received from St. PetmLargh, in Russia,  
(tome fine Urge drawings of the great Asiatick  
Mammoth, whose skeleton, together with wmc  
portions of the skin and muscular parts, has lately  
been discovered, in a elate of excellent preservati­  
on, under vast masses of ice, near the mouth of the  
river Lama, in lat. 72 North. For this, to me in­  
estimable present, I am indebted to the kindness of  
Mr. Tilesius, an eminent naturalist, by whom the  
drawings were made, and who has, at the same  
time, favoured me with some important manuscript  
observations concerning the animal.  
1 need not tell you that this Asiatick Mammoth  
is specifically distinct from the great Mammoth of  
North America; that whose bones have been disco­  
vered iu so many parts of our continent, and that  
of which Mr. Peale has mounted the skeleton, in  
bis museum. The two animals are specifically dis­  
tinct. though I am very far from thinking them ge­  
ntrically so. Out the Asiatick Mammoth has, at  
some period, been a native of America, as well as  
of Asia, and of Europe. The giinding teeth, the  
incisors (or tusks), and other bones of this animal,  
! have been discovered in several parts of the United  
States, &amp;c. as in Pennsylvania, in the river Sus­  
quehanna, a branch of which I have elsewhete  
shewn, receives its name of “ Chemung” from the  
intisors of one of these huge animals. Similar re­  
mains have been discovered in the county of Wythe,  
in this state; in the same imiriatick lick along  
&#x27; *ith the remains of the other Mammoth, or what  
I will call for the present, the Ohio Mammoth ; m  
South Carolina in digging the Santee canal; in Ken­  
tucky, and doubtless, in many other places, some  
of which I could mention. I had lung suspected,  
and even asserted, that the Mammoth of the Che­  
mung was the same us that of Siberia ; and this  
matter is now pul beyond all doubt by the drawings  
and information communicated to me by Mr. Tile­  
sius.  
  
m least one species oi elephant, therefore (for it  
is by all naturalists allowed, that the Asiatirk  
Mammoth was a legitimate species of Elephas), has  
been a native both of the old and the new world.—  
lam imbued, however, to think, that the species  
have never been so common in America as in Asia,  
from whence, therefore, I venture to conjecture,  
that the stock originally proceeded. It is too soon,  
however, in the more cautious aud sober disrussi­  
ons of natural history, to press forward such con­  
jectures as these. We have just begun the study of  
the natural history of our country. Future resear­  
ches and uiscoverres may render it at least highly J  
probable, that the Asiatirk Mammoth, as we now  
call it, was once as common in North America, as  
in any part of the old world. Permit me to add,  
that I um daily put in possession of facts which  
prove, that our continent and Asia have had, and J  
still continue to have, in common, many species of I  
animals and vegetables, in all essential points the  
same. |  
Mr. Tilesius’s drawings are of great importance  
to me : and they came, unasked and even unlooked  
for, almost at the very time that I was busily occu­  
pied in superintending a drawing of the skeleton in  
the museum, and in pulling together my materials,  
the fruit of mauy years lesearch, concerning the  
Ohio animal. The two animals, it is true, ure ve­  
ry different from each other. The affinities dre  
such, that l cannot consent to consider the Ameri­  
can animal as any thing but a species of Elephant.  
1 know, indeed, that Mr. Crine is now of opinion,  
that the Ohio bones bespeak an animal gcnerkully  
I different from the elephant. Bui-although ibis na­  
turalist&#x27;s authority is deservedly high, and of great  
weight, I am disposed to adhere to my own opiuion,  
and to consider the Ohio Mammoth as belonging to  
the same genus, or family, as the two or three still  
existing species of elephant, and as the great ex  
tinct Mammoth of the North of Asia and of Eu­  
rope ; the elephas primigenius of Biumenbach : or,  
us we in America, may name it, to distinguish it  
from the Ohio elephant, the ‘‘Chemung Mammoth.&quot;  
Although in the general form of the molares, or  
grinders, there is a much greater affinity between  
the Asiatirk mammoth and the existing Aaiaiick  
elephant, than there is between either of these lat­  
ter animals and the Ohio-mammoth, yet there are  
several other characters in which the resemblance  
is much closer between the Ohio animal and the ex­  
tinct Asiatirk mammoth, than between this latter  
and the living elephant of Asia. I shall only, at  
present, mention one of these characters ; that of  
the incisors, or defences, which we rail tusks.—  
These in the Ohio-mammoth and in the elephas  
primigenius, or Chemung mammoth, are, indeed,  
very similar, both in theii relative proportion to  
the general mass of the skeleton of the two auimals,  
and in their degrees of curvature.  
On the other band, the Ohio mammoth and the  
living Asiatirk elephant seem to have been more  
m arly allied to earh other, in the form of their feel,  
than were the latter animal aud the extinct Asiatirk  
mammoth ; i. e. the Chemung mammoth. When  
Mr. Tilesius shall publish his history and drawings  
of the elephas primigenius, and when the history  
of the elephas mastodenlus shall be completed, e­  
  
very m-.cMigtni ana ranaKi naturalist will be nim­  
bly struck with the circumstances which I have  
mentioned : and I flatter myself, that some of the  
most learned of these naturalists, and among oth­  
ers my candid and liberal friend Tilesius, will not  
refuse their assent to my opinion, that the mam­  
moth of the Ohio has brena true species of elephant.  
Mr. Tilrsius&#x27;s drawings are important to me in  
another point of view. .They plainly shew, I  
think, what has been the natural direction of the  
incisors in the bead of the Ohio-mammoth, In­  
deed, previously to the receipt of these drawings,  
I had satisfied my mind as to this point, from the  
information which I had received from an intelli.  
j gent correspondent, who had bad an opportunity of  
| seeing the incisors still occuping their original posi­  
tron in the head of a mammoth which was discov.  
| ered, a tew years since, in one of our western mu­  
I riatirk licks, or salines.  
An to the form of the grinders, and the dispositi­

them, I grant that it is very different in the Ohio­

UO.AS. OIK,  
  
As you take much interest in the knowledge of  
every thing relative to the American mammoth,  
and similar animals, I am ptrsmded that you will  
be glad to learri, that I have recently received  
from St. Petcrsbufgh in Russia, some fine large  
drawings of the great Asiatic mammoth, whose  
skeleton, together with some portions of the skin  
  
nuu muscular paiiS) lias taiciy ueni uibi.uvcicvi,  
in a slate of excellent preservation, under vast  
masses of ice, near the mouth cf the Lena, in  
latitude 72 north. For this, to me inestimable,  
  
&quot;present, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Ti­  
lesjus, an eminent naturalist, by.whom thedraw­  
ings were made, and who, has, at the same lime,  
favored nie-&#x27;with some important manuscript&quot; ob  
servations concerning the animal.  
I need not tell you, that this Asiatic mammoth  
is specifically distinct from the great mammoth of  
North America ; that whose bones have been dis­  
covered in so many parts of our continent, and  
.that-of which Mr. Peale has mounted the sktle

cifically distinct, though I am very far from think  
no- them eenericallu so. But the Asiatic mammoth

America, as in any part of the old world. Per  
mil me to add,- that I am daily put in possessibit

,1 &#x27;irjinia Jvty 13iA, 13it).  
Dear Sir, As you take much mter-  
e5tin the knowledge 01 every tnmgrc-Ijut-  
to the American Mammoth and  
olhtr similar animals I am persuaded  
thit you will be glad to learn that I hare  
ttcently reccirrd Irom feiersDurgn- in  
Rosia. some fine large drawings of the  
Krcit Asiatic Mammoth, whose skele­  
ton tegcther with some portion of the  
..&#x27; --j Mi.1. htvp lafplv been dis-  
coTcrcfl, in a state of excellent prcser­  
otion, under vast masses of ice, near  
tt mouth of the River&#x27;Lena, in La?. 72  
Vnrih. For this, to me mestimaoic prc-  
t.r! I am indebted to the kindness of  
Mr. Tills iius, an eminent naiurahit, by  
the draWioes were made, and  
who has, at the same time favored me  
tith some important manuscript obxer­  
i nioas concemiftg tht animal.  
1 need not tell you that this Asiatic  
Mammoth is specifically distinct from  
lie great Mammoth of North America ;  
tint whose bones have been discovered  
ia so many parts of our continent, and  
that cf which Mr- Pcale has mounted  
the skeleton in his Museum. The two  
animals are specifically distinct, though  
1 am fir from thinking them genetically  
0. But the Asiatic Mammoth has, at  
tr.mt former Deriod. been a native of  
America, as well as of Asia, and of Eu  
rope. The grinding teeth, the incisors  
(or tusks) and other bones of this ani­  
mal, have been discovered in several  
Afferent parts of the United States, &amp;c.  
is in Pennsylvania, in ihe Susquehan­  
Tih,a branch of which I have elsewhere  
thewn, reccif es its name of &#x27;Chemuiig  
from the incisors of one of one of these  
huge animals. Similar remains have  
tetn discovered in the county of Wythe,  
b this state : in the same muriatic  
Eok along with the remains of the o­  
ther Mammoth, or what wt shall call  
fir the prtsent, the Ohio Mammoth ;  
ia South Carolina, in digging the San­  
tee canal ; in Kentucky, and doub:lcss  
ia many other places, some of which I  
could mention. I bad long suspecied,  
and even asserted, that the Mammoth  
of the Chemung was the same as tha; of  
Siberia ; and this matter is now put be­  
yond all doubt, by the drawings and in  
farmition communicated to m: by Mr.  
Tilesius.  
At least one species of Llephant,  
therefore (for it is by all naturalists al­  
lowed, that the Asiatic Mammoth was  
a legitimate species of Elephas), has  
been a native both ol the old and nf the  
cew world. I am inclined, however, to  
think, that the species have never been  
so common in America as- in Asia, from  
wheoce, therefore, I venture to conjec  
ture, that the stock originally proceeded.  
It is too soon, however, in the more so­  
ber discussions of natural history, to  
press forward such conjectures as these.  
We ha?e just begun the study of the  
natural history of our country. Future  
researches and discoveries may render  
it at least highly probable, that the Asia­  
tic Mammoth, as we now call it, was  
oace as common in North America, as  
in any par t of the world. Permit me to  
add, that I am daily put in&quot; possession of  
feet which prove, that our &#x27;continent  
and Asia have had,&#x27; and still continue to  
bare, in common, many species of ani­  
mals St vegetables, in all ettential points  
the same. : &quot; y  
Mr. Ttlesius&#x27;s drawings are of great  
importance to roe : and they came, un.  
atied and even unlocked for, almost at  
the very time thai I was busily occupied  
to superintending a drawing of the ske­  
leton in the Muscurai and in putting to­  
gether my materials, the fruit of many  
years research, concerning the Ohio  
animaL The two animals, it .is true,  
very different from each other x but  
bey have nevertheless, great and intc­  
reiin affinities .to .each other. The  
&amp;uues are such, that I cannot consent  
to consider the American animal as a-  
jy thing but a pecie if Elcpfiant I j!

animal generically different from the E­  
lephant. But although tVis naturalist&#x27;s  
authority isdeservedly high, and of great  
w-ight, I am disposed to adhere to, my  
own opinion, and to consider the Ohio  
  
Mammoth as belonging to the same  
genus, or family, as the two or thret­  
still existing species of Elephant, and as  
tnr great extinct Mammoth of the North  
of Asia and of Europe ; lheElephas Pri­  
migenius of Blumenbach : or, -3 we in  
America, may name it, to distinguish it..  
from the Ohio Elephant, the &quot;Chemung  
Mammoth.1&#x27;  
Although m the general form of the  
molares or grinders, there is a much  
greater affinity between the Asiatic  
Mammoth and the existing Asiatic Ele­  
phant, than there is between either of  
these latter animals and the Ohio Mam­  
moth, yet there are several other cha­  
racters in which the resemblance is  
much closer between the Ohio animal  
and the extinct Asiatic Mammoth, than  
between this latter and the living Ele­  
phant of Asia. I shall only, at present,  
mention ore of these characters ; that  
of the incisors, or defent?s which we call  
tusks. These in the Ohio-Mammoth  
and in the Elephas Primigenius, or Che­  
mung Mammoth, are, indeed, very si  
milar, both in their rrlattve proportion  
to the general mass of the skeleton of  
the two animals, and in their degrees of  
curvature.  
On the other hand, the Ohio mam  
moth and the living Asiatic Elephant  
seem to have been more nearly allied lo  
each other, in the form of their feet, th:&#x27;n  
were the latter apimal and the extinct  
Asiatic Mammoth : i. e. the Chemung  
Mammoth. When Mr. Tilesius shall  
publish his history and drawings of the  
Elephas Primigenius, and when the his  
tory of the Elephas Mastodr-ntus shall  
he core pleted, every intelligei&amp; and can  
did naturalist will be forcibly struck with  
the circumstances which I have men­  
tioned : and I flatter myself, that some  
of the most learned of these naturalists,  
and among others my candid and liberal  
friend TUesius, will not refuse their as­  
sent to my opinion, that the Mammoth  
of the Ohio has been a true species cf  
Elephant.  
Mr.Tilesius&#x27;s drawings are important  
o me in another point of view. They  
plainly show, I think, what has been the  
natural direction of the incisors in the  
head of the Ohio-Mammoth. Indeed,  
previously to the receipt of these draw­  
ings, 1 had satisfied my mind as to this  
point, from the information which I hve  
received from an intelligent correspon­  
dent, who had had an opportunity of  
senng the incisors still occupying their  
original position in the head of a Mam­  
moth which was discovered, a few years  
since, in onq. of our western muriatic  
licks, or salines.  
As&quot; to the form of the grinders, and  
the disposition of the vilriou body , or  
enamel, upon and through them, I grant  
that it is very different in the Ohio­  
Mammoth and in the extinct as well as  
existing Elephants of the old world,  
But if this difference be of suacient im­  
portance to constitute a difference of ge  
nut between the American and Asiatic  
animals, then we mus procf-cd consis  
tently to break up .several cf the long  
esiahlished genera of mammalia, subdi  
vidmg each genus into at least two dis­  
tinct genera, I may mention the ge­  
nus Marmot, to which belongs our  
Ground-Hog or Manack, as illustrative  
of this idea. I shall call the Ohio Mam­  
moth, Elephas Mastodentus It is the  
Elephas, Amcricanus of Air. Blumen­  
bach.I , have nearly prepared, and shall  
shortly present to our Philosophical So­  
ciety, an extensile memoir on the&#x27; ex­  
tinction of the species of mammalia.  
This memoir will necessarily contain  
much matter merely of a speculative  
nature : but I flatter myself that it vill  
also contain some interesting, and hi­  
therto unnoticed facts.  
I shall be much gratified if this let­  
ter, written &#x27;among the mountains of  
your stare, at a distance from my, books  
and papets, afford you any amusemenu  
Of all tht subjects of animal natural his  
tory, there is not one more interesting  
tnan that which relates, to the charac­  
ters and history of those vast organized  
h . dies many of thero, too, endowed  
with an immense portion of intelli­  
gence which the God cf Nature had  
created ; and- after &#x27; suffering them o  
grow an-t, exist through ages, unknown  
agcsNoF timej his, a length, entjrcly&quot;

something awful in tho consideration of  
  
I this.subject : and yet this Very subject  
lis admirably calculated to display to us  
  
the wisdom as well as power, of him  
who formed all things. The harmqny  
of nature is not, in the smallest degree,  
disturbed by the total destruction of what  
many have deemed necessary integral  
ports of a common whole. Nor is this  
business of the extinction of species&#x27; a;  
an end That which has already taken  
;dace, with respect to species ;pf Ele­  
phant, Rhinoceros, and other vast fa­  
milies of animals, will unquestionably  
take place, with respect to many of the  
families of animals which now cover the  
surface of this globe The steps cf  
this vast and generally unlocked for  
change, are rapidly preparing, in diffe  
rent parts of the world ; and in none, I  
think, more rapidly than in that; portion  
of it whirh we inhabit.

Tilesius an eminent naturalist, by whom the  
drawings were made, and who has, at the same  
time favoured roe with some important manu­  
script observations concerning the animal.  
I need not tell ycii, that this Asiatic Mam­  
moth is specifically distinct from the great  
Mammoth of North America ; that whose  
bones have been discovered in so many pirts  
of our continent, and ihat of which Mr. Peak  
  
Mias mounted the skeleton, in his museum.-  
  
The two animals are specifically distinct, tho&#x27;  
I am very far from thinking them genetically  
so. Bui the Asiatic Mammoth &#x27;has, at some  
former period, been a native of America,&quot; as  
well as of Asia, and of Kurope. The grinding  
teeth, the incissors (or tusks,) and Other bones  
of this animal, have been discovered in several  
different parts of the United States, &amp;c. as in  
  
Pennsylvania, ijri the river Susquehanna, a  
branch of which I have elsewhere shown, re  
  
ceives its-name of &quot;Chemung&quot; from the incis­  
sors of one of these huge animals. Similar re  
  
mains have been discovered in the county oi  
  
Wythe, innh5s state ; in the same mmiatic lick  
  
along with the remr.im bf the other Mammoth,  
or what I will call, for the present, ther Ohio  
  
Mammoth: in Sou&#x27;h Carolina in digging the  
Sitntee canal ; in Kvntuckjand doubtless, in  
  
many other p laces, some f fchich I could men

that the Mammoth of the Chevong was the  
same as that of Sebei ia : and this matter is now  
put beyond all doubt by the drawings rtnd in­  
formation communicated to rne ,by Mr. Tile-  
sius. . .;Y .;&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27; iv.;;&#x27;  
  
At least one species of elephant, therefore  
  
(for it is by all naturalists allowed, that the A­  
niatic Mammoth wfis a legitimate species of E­  
lephas,) has been a native both of the old and  
new world. , I am inclined however, to think,  
that the .&#x27;species has never been so common in,  
  
America as in Asia, from tvhencVi therefore,  
  
I venture to cpnjeciure, that the.stock original­

cinity of Baris, Fa. July 13, laiO?  
Dear Sir,  
As you take much interest in the  
knowledge of every thing relative to the A_  
merican Mammoth, and other similar ani  
mals, I am persuaded that you will be glad  
to learn that 1 have recently received from  
St. Petersburg!! in Russia, some line large  
drawings of the great Asiatic IMominoth,  
whose skeleton, together wish some portions  
ot the skin and muscular parts, has lately  
been discovered, in a state of excellent pie”  
servatioo. under vas* masses of ice, near the  
mouth of the river Lena, in latitude 72  
North. For this, to me inestimable, present,  
I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Ti  
lesius. an eminent naturalist, by whom the  
drawings were made, and who has, at the  
same time, favored me with some impor  
taut manuscript observations concerning the  
animal.  
I need not tell you. that this Asiatic Mam  
moth is specifically distinct from the gieat  
Mammoth ot Norh America; that whose  
bones have been discovered in so many parts  
ot our continent, and that of which Mr.  
Peale has mounted the skeleton, in his mu  
seuirt. 1 he two animals are specifically  
distinct, though I am very tar from thinking  
them gencrically so. Bui the Asiatic Mam  
moth has, at some former period, been ana  
tive ot America, as well as of Asia, and of  
Europe. The grinding teeth, the incisors  
(or tusks,) and other bones of ibis animal,  
have been discovered in several different  
parts of the U.S &amp;c. as in Pennsylvania, in  
the river Susquehanna, a brancii of which I  
have elsewhere shown, receives its name of  
Chemung from the incisors of one of these  
huge animals. Similar remains have bien  
discovered in the county of Wythe, in this  
| state ; in tile same muriatic lick aiung wjtii  
the lemainsot the other Mammoth, or wiiat  
I will call, fur the present, the Ohio Main  
moth ; m S(&gt;uili Carolina in digging the San -  
tee canal ; m Kentucky, and doubtless, in  
&#x27; m*‘n&gt; mher places, some of which 1 could  
mention. I had long suspected, and even  
asserted, that the Mammoth of the Chemung  
was the Same as that ot Siberia : and this  
muttei is imw put beyond all doubt by the  
diavviugs and information communicated to  
me by Mi. Filesius  
  
. oi elephant, therefore,  
(ior it is by al. naturalists allowed, that the  
A »iatic Mammoth was a legitimate species ot  
fcdephas.) has been a native bo li ot the old  
and ot etie new world. I am inclined, how  
ever, to think, that the species has never  
been so com mon in America as in Asia, t rum  
wneuce, therefore 1 venture to conjecture,  
that thes.ock oi iginaUy proceeded. It is too  
soon, however, in the more caution* and so­  
bei discussions ot natural history, to press  
tor ward such conjectures as these. We  
Itave just begun the study of the natural Ins  
tory of our country. Future reseat dies and  
discoveries may render it at least highly  
probable, that the Asiatic M unmotli. aswe  
iu.•/ call it, was once as common in North  
America, as in any part of the old world.  
1 ci mit me to add, that I am daily pot in  
possession of fans winch piove, that our  
continent and Asia have hail, and s ill con  
tinue t« have, in common, many species of  
animals and vegetables, in all enncntiai points  
the same.  
Mr 1 desius’s drawings are of great im­  
portance to me : and they came, unasked and  
even unlocked tor. almost at Wic very time  
that 1 was busily occupied in superintend  
mg a drawing ot the skeleton in the muse  
urn, and in putting together my materials,  
the Iruit ot many years research, o&gt;. cerning  
me Ohio animal. I&#x27;he two animals, it is  
tine, ate very different from each other :  
but they h ive, nevertheless, great and in­  
teresting affinitic. to each other. The affin  
ties are such, that I cannot consent to consi­  
der the American animal as any thing but  
i ({ *tlrc%*rH °t l&#x27;le/ihant I know, indeed, that  
Mr. Cuvier is now of opinion, that the Ohio I  
hones bespeak an animal i&#x27;cnericully difi-r  
ent from the elephant. But although this:  
naturalist s authority is deservedly high, and ]  
oi groat weight, I am disposed to adhere to ;  
my own opinion, and to consider the Ohio I  
Mammoth as belongmg to the same genus, !  
or tnmi.y, as the two or three still existing  
species of elphaut, and as the great ex !  
tmci Mammoth of the North of Asia and ot  
I&#x27;.urope ; the elephan priaiigeniusoi Bluinen  
bach : or, as we in America, may name it,  
to distinguish it from the Ohio elephant, the  
“ Chemung Mammoth.”  
f Although m the general form of the mo­  
biles, or grinders, therein a much greater  
affinity be wren the Asiatic M unmoth and  
the exis ing Asiatic elephant, than there  
Is between either of tn^sc lat er animals anti  
the Ohio Mammoth, yet there arc nevercl  
other characters in which the resemblance  
rs much closer between the Ohio animal and,  
the extinct Asiatic Mammoth, than betwee,,  
tins latter and the living; elephant of Asia  
  
i shall only at present, mention one of hese  
cii.ifdCic s ; that oi the incisors, nr rfcfnicra,  
which we call tusks. These in tli , Ohm  
Mammoth a.id in the e&#x27;eph. 3 pmnigcmus,  
&lt;&gt;r Chemung Mammoth, are. indeed, very  
similar, bu ll in tiieir relative proportion to  
the general tnass of the skeleton of the  
two animals, and in their degrees af curva­  
ture.  
On the other hand, the Ohio Mammoth  
and the living Asiatic elepaant se into have  
been more nearly allied to each oilier, in the  
form ot their feet, than were he latter ani­  
mal and the extinct Asiatic M mini &gt;tii: i. c.  
the Chemung Mammoth. When Mr. Tile­  
sins shall [&gt;ub ish his history and drawing of  
1 the eltphas prim genius, and when he his­  
t°ry of the elephas mast&#x27; d ulus sh .11 be  
completed, even intelligent an I cand-d nat­  
uralist will he forcibly struck with the cir­  
cumstances which I have inemioin d; £c Itt it­  
ter myself, • (l it some of he m »s&gt; learned of  
Iu sc Hat 111 alists. a ml among others mv can­  
did and liberal friend Tilebus, will not re­  
fuse their assent to my opinion, that the  
Mammoth of the Ohio has becu a true s te­  
cies of elephant. 1  
Mr. Tilesius’s drawings are important to  
me in another point of view. They plainly  
show. I think, what has been the nuiural&#x27;&amp;i­  
rection ol the mcisors in the h ad of the Ohio  
Matnmo&#x27;ii. Indeed;) previo. s y to tlie re­  
ceipt of these drawing-., 1 had sa&#x27;i-fi d ,ny  
mind as o this point, from the information  
w.ucli 1 had 1 eceived from &amp;n intelligent cor­  
respondent, who had an °pporuini&#x27;.y of see­  
ing the incisors still occupying iheir original  
position in the head of a .Mammoth which,  
was discovered, a few years since, in  
one of our western muriatic licks, or sa­  
lines.  
  
As to the form of the grinders, and the  
disposition or ne vitreous body, or enamel  
npon i&gt;r through them, Igrant that it is ve*  
iy different in the Ohio_mammoth and in.  
the extinct as well as exciting elephant ot&#x27;  
the old world. But if this difference be of  
sum ient importance to constitute a differ­  
ence ot genua between the American and  
Asiatic animals, then we must proceeii  
consistently to break up several of thts  
long established genera of mammalia, sub­  
dividing each genus into at least two dis­  
V!lct StM,ern* l &lt;&gt;»av mention the genus­  
. liimot, to winch belongs &gt;ur ground h g,  
or Manrck, as illustrative of this idea f

uecessarib contain much ma&quot;er. men lv of  
a speculative nature; but I fl utef mi self,  
that it will also contain some iutereating­  
anu hitherto unnoticed tic&#x27;s.  
I shall be much gratified if thlis letter

at a distance from my bonks and p ipers, afl  
ford you am amusement. Of all ihesuSit c-3  
of animal natural history, there in not one  
more interesting than that which relates -o  
the characters and his orv of those vase  
organized bodies —many of the n, too en«.  
dowed with an immense portion of ir.telli  
gance which the God of Nature had cre­  
ated ; and after suffering th in -o grow and  
exist through age*, unknown ages, of time,  
has at leng-h entirely removed from »he&gt;  
earth; not merely as individuals, but as  
9/iecieg. I here is somethi-;g awful in tlm  
consideration of this subject: ami vet this  
very subject is admirably calculated to dis­  
play to us the wi*d &gt;m as wedt as power, fltim  
who formed all things The harmony of  
nature is not, in the s uallesr degree, disturb­  
ed by the to»al destruction of what manvhave  
deemed neceam/ry integral parts of a com­  
mon whole. Nor is this business of dieex­  
&quot;ic ion of species a&#x27; an &amp;nd. That which,  
has already taken place, with respect ter  
species of Elephant, Rhinoceros and other  
vast families of animals, will unquestionably  
take place, with respect to many of tlie fa­  
milies of anim. ls which now cover tlie sur—  
1 ice of this globe. The steps of this vast  
and generally utilor ked forchangp, are ra­  
pid.y preparing in difF rent parts of die  
wond ; and in none, I think, more rapidly

dated Blue Ridge, vicinity of Paris, Virginia, July 13, 1810.  
  
Dear Sir,  
  
As you take much interest in the knowledge of every thing  
relative to the American mammoth, and other similar animals, I  
am persuaded that you will be glad to learn, that I have recently  
received from St. Petersburgh in Russia, some fine large drawings  
of the great Asiatic mammoth, whose skeleton, together with some  
portions of the skin and muscular parts, has lately been discovered-  
in a state of excellent preservation, under vast masses of ice, near  
the mouth of the river Lena, in latitude 72° North. Forthis, to me,  
inestimable present, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Tilesius,  
an eminent naturalist, by whom the drawings were made, and who  
has, at the same time, favoured me with some important manuseript

I need not ggll you, that this Asiatic mammoth Is specifically dis-  
tinct from the great mammoth of North America: that whose  
boneg have been discovered in so many parts of our continent, and  
that of which Mr. Peale has mounted the skeleton, in his museum.  
The two animals are specifically distinct, though Iam very far  
from thinking them generically so. But the Asiatic mammoth  
  
has, at some former period, becn a native of America, as well as of  
Asia and of Europe. The grinding teeth, the incisors, (or tusks)  
and other bones of this animal, have been discovered in several dif

ferent parts of the United States, &amp;c. as in Pennsylvania, in the  
river Susquehanna, a branch of which I have elsewhere shown, re-  
ceives its name of “ Chemung” from the incisors of one of these  
huge animals. Similiar remains have been discovered in the coun-  
ty of Wythe, in this state ; in the same muriatic lick along with the  
remains of the other mammoth, or what I will call, for the present,  
the Ohio mammoth: in South Carolina in digging the Santee ca-  
nal; in Kentucky, and doubtless, in many other places, some of  
which I could mention. I had long su-pected, and even asserted,  
that the mammoth of the Chemung was the same as that of Sibe-  
ria; and this matter is now put beyond all doubt by the drawings  
and information communicated to me by Mr. Tilesius.  
  
At least one species of elephant, therefore (for it is by all natural-  
ists allowed, that the Asiatic mammoth was a legitimate species of  
elephas) has been a native both of the old and new world. I am  
inclined however, to think, that the species has never been so com-  
mon in America as in Asia, from whence, therefore, I venture to  
conjecture, that the stock originally proceeded. _ It is too soon,  
however, in the more cautious and sober discussions of natural his-  
tory, to press forward such conjectures as these. | We have just  
begun the study of the natural history of our country. Future re-  
searches and discoveries may render it at least highly probable, that  
the Asiatic mammoth, as we now call it, was once as common in  
North America as in any part of the old world. Permit me to add,  
that I am daily put in the possession of facts which prove that our  
continent and Asi have had, and still continue to have, in common,  
many species of animals and vegetables, in a// essential points the  
same.  
  
Mr. Tilesius’s drawings are of great importance to me ; and they  
came, unasked and even unlooked for, almost at the very time that  
I was busily occupied in superintending a drawing of the skeleton  
in the museum, and in putting together my materials, the fruit of  
many years research, concerning the Ohio animal. The two ani-  
mals, it is true, are very different from each other; but they have,  
nevertheless, great and interesting affinities toeach other. The  
affinities are such, that I cannot consent to consider the American  
animal as any thing but @ species of eleghant. I know, indeed, that  
Mr. Cuvier is now of opinion, that the Ohio bones bespeak an animal

generically different from the elephant. But although thisnatural-  
ist’s authority is deservedly high, and of great weight, I am dis-  
  
posed to adhere to my own opinion, and to consider the Ohio mam-  
moth as belonging to the same genus, or family, as the two or three  
still existing species of elephant, and as the great extinct mammoth  
of the North of Asia and of Europe; the elephas primigenius of  
Blumenbach ; or, as we in America may name it, to distinguish it  
from the Ohio elephant, the “ Chemung mammoth.”  
  
Although in the general form of the molares, or grinders, there  
is a much greater affinity between the Asiatic mammoth and the ex-  
isting Asiatic elephant, than there is between either of these latter  
animals and the Ohio mammoth, yet there are several other cha-  
racters in which the resemblance is much closer between the Ohio  
animal and the extinct Asiatic mammoth, than between this latter  
and the living elephant of Asia. I shall only, at present, mention  
one of these characters ; that of the incisors, or defences, which we  
call tusks. These in the Ohio mammoth and in the elephas pri-  
migenius, or Chemung mammoth, are indeed, very similar, both  
in their relative proportion to the general mass of the skeleton of  
the two animals, and in their degrees of curvature.  
  
On the other hand, the Ohio mammoth and the living Asiatic  
elephant seem to have been more nearly allied to each other, in the  
form of their feet, than were the latter animal and the extinct Asiatic  
mammoth: z.e. the Chemung mammoth. When Mr. Tilesius  
shall publish his history and drawings of the elephas primigenius,  
and when the history of the elephas mastodontus shall be completed,  
every intelligent and candid naturalist will be forcibly struck with  
the circumstances which I have mentioned: and I flatter myself,  
that some of the most learned of these naturalists, and among others  
my candid and liberal friend Tilesius, will not refuse their assent to  
my opinicn, that tae mammoth of the Ohio has been a true species  
of elephant.  
  
Mr. Tilesius’s drawings are important to me in another point of  
view. They plainly show, I think, what has been the natural di-  
rection of the incisors in the head of the Ohio mammoth. Indeed,  
  
previously to the receipt of these drawings, I had satisfied my mind  
as to this point, from the information which I had received from an  
intelligent correspondent, who had had an opportunity of seeing the

incisors still occupying their original position in the head of a mam-  
moth, which was discovered a few years since, in one of our westerm  
muriatic licks, or salines.  
  
As to the form of the grinders, and the disposition of the vitrious  
body, or enamel, upon and through them, I grant that it is very dif-  
ferent in the Ohio mammoth, and in the extinct as well as existing  
elephants of the old world. But if this difference be of sufficient  
importance to constitute a difference of genus between the Ameri-  
can and Asiatic animals, then we must proceed consistently to  
break up several of the long established genera of mammalia, sub-  
dividing each genus into at least two distinct genera. I may men-  
tion the genus Marmot, to which belongs our ground hog, or  
monack, as illustrative of this idea. I shall call the Ohio mam-  
moth, Elephas Mastodontus. It is the Elephas Americanus of Mr.  
Blumenbach.  
  
I have nearly prepared, and shal! shortly present to our Philoso-  
phical Society, an extensive memoir on the extinction of the spe-  
cies of mammalia. This memoir will necessarily contain much  
matter merely of a speculative nature; but I flatter myself that it  
will also contain some interesting, and hitherto unnoticed facts.  
  
I shall be much gratified if this letter, written among the moun-  
tains of your state, at a distance from my books and papers, afford  
you any amusement. Ofall the subjects of animal natural history,  
there is not one more interesting than that which relates to the  
characters and history of those vast organized bodies—many of  
them, too, endowed with an immense portion of intelligence which  
the God of Nature had created; and after suffering them to grow  
and exist through ages, unknown ages of time, has, at length, en-  
tirely removed from the earth; not merely as individuals, but as  
species. There is something awful in the consideration of this  
subject ; and yet this very subject is admirably calculated to display  
to us the wisdom, as well as power, of him who formed all things.  
The harmony of nature is not, in the smallest degree, disturbed by  
the total destruction of what many have deemed necessary integral  
parts of acommon whole. Nor is this business of the extinction of  
species at an end, ‘¥hat which has already taken place, with re-  
spect to species of elephant, rhinoceros, and other vast families of |  
animals, will unquestionably take place with respect to many of the
