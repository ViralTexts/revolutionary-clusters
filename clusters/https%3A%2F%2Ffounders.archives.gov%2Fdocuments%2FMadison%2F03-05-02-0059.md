s in Hampshire, Franklin, and Hampden Counties, Massachusetts  
24 July 1812. “At a convention of republican delegates, consisting of one hundred and forty two members, from fifty one towns, in the late County of Hampshire comprising the counties of Hampshire, Franklin, and Hampden, convened at the Court-House in Northampton on the twentieth day of July inst. at eleven o’clock A.M. to counteract the effects of a convention holden at the same place on the 14th. inst. Samuel Buffington Esquire was unanimously chosen Moderator, and Thomas Shepherd, Secretary of the Convention. The following report and resolutions were unanimously adopted.  
“The Committee appointed by a delegation of republican citizens assembled at West Springfield on the 13 inst. to take into consideration the causes of the present war with Great-Britain and the combinations which are believed to exist to dissolve the present happy Union of the States, and to present the result of their deliberation to a republican convention to be held at Northampton on the 20th. inst. from all the towns in the former county of Hampshire, have attended that service and beg leave to submit the following report and resolutions: After an attentive perusal of the documents submited to Congress by the president of the United States, it most clearly appears, that both England and France have, for several years, violated the neutral rights, insulted the flag, and depredated upon the lawful commerce of the United States on the high seas. That Great Britain in addition to the outrages done on the ocean, has committed the most atrocious violences within our own waters, impressed our seamen and excited the savages to an indiscriminate massacre of the inhabitants of our frontiers.  
“The goverment of the United States actuated by a sincere disposition to remain at peace with all the world, have attempted by negociation commenced and prosecuted in a spirit of amity and impartiality, to settle all our differences with both the belligerents. Those powers, blind to their true policy, and regardless of justice, have refused to comply with our reasonable terms of accommodation. France, inflamed by a blind rage against England, is resolved to destroy British commerce, and England, governed not only by a mortal hatred against France, but jealous of the prosperity of the American republic, is determined to establish for herself a monopoly of commerce and the dominion of the seas. That this view of the designs of Great Britain is correct, we need only advert to the notorious fact, that while she has been cutting up American commerce by the roots, while she has been depriving us of an adequate market for the great staples of our country, while she has seized our merchantmen and condemned our property in her prize Courts, under the pretext of retaliating, on her enemy, she has herself carried on an extensive trade with that enemy under licences and forged papers. In many instances the very cargoes of American property, owned and freighted by American citizens, after being condemned in England under the Orders in Council, has been shipped to the contine[n]t of Europe and sold for the benefit of the captors.  
“In this way does England retaliate on her enemy by seeking every corrupt opportunity of trading with her in the merchandize plundered from the citizens of the United States. To submit to such injustice while we have the power to resist would be to surrender our independence without a struggle. A degree of degradation to which the United States ar[e] not reduced, and by the permission of the Almighty we trust they never will be. When by the valor of the American people crowned by the blessing of God, the United States were severed from the British yoke; they acquired all the rights and privileges of an independant nation. After the expulsion of the British from our shores, those rights and privileges were acknowledged to belong to our republic by the powers of the world, not excepting Great Britain herself.  
“Among those rights thus guaranteed, those of navigating the ocean under the known laws of nations, and of protecting the lives, liberty and property of our citizens in the persuit of a lawful commerce, were always deemed most sacred.  
  
“To violate these by any nation is an act of war, and to refuse to make reparation for the wrong by the offending party is a just and righteous cause for war on the part of the injured. There is no doubt then, that the United States have just cause of war against England and France; but sound policy required that we should not be burthened by a war with two powerful nations at once, Congress therefore wisely selected England as our enemy, she being the first and the greatest aggressor. England by her orders in council has given a fatal stab to the freedom of commerce, has violated the laws of nations and under pretexts the most futile has exercised the rights of sovereignty over us. In the impressment of seamen sailing under the protection of the American flag she has trampled upon the personal liberty of the citizen and entered with ruthless violence the sanctuary of our independence, dragging her victims to slavery and to death. In employing the savages to murder our people, a fact which is confirmed by the testimony of Governor Harrison, and which no one can doubt who knows the influence the British have over the Indian tribes, she has shewn that she disregards those maxims which ought to govern civilized nations. In sending a secret agent among us to plot with the disaffected a dismemberment of the Union; she has convinced the world that she makes use of means to accomplish her nefarious purposes, at once the most atrocious and the most despicable. With these just grounds for war, with such powerful inducements to rally round the ark of our independence and defend it; it is a matter of astonishment to us that any men that claim to be Americans should be so entangled in the Coils of party, so lost to themselves, so dead to the injuries inflicted upon their country as to deny the justice of this war altogether. Your committee are fully convinced that the present war is not only just but necessary and unavoidable. Even however did they doubt of the necessity or policy of the war they should hold it to be their duty, now that war has been resorted to, to support the government in it, in order that our rulers might have a fair chance to obtain an acknowledgement of our rights. Every other expedient has been tried in vain to bring belligerents to a sense of justice, and nothing remained to choose but war or unconditional and base submission.  
“If the war of the revolution was just, this war is not less so. That was a war against arbitrary taxation of the British Parliament. It was a war for Independence. It was a war for liberty and equal rights. It was begun in honor and ended in glory. At the commencement of it, clouds and darkness hung over the country, our internal enemies, those ill omened birds of night were continually croaking around; ruin, devastation and death were the burthen of their song; but genius of America triumphed and left her sons, a rich inheritance, cemented by the blood of her heroes. Let no one say that this prize was not worth contending for. We have reason to thank God that the noble virtues and exemplary courage of the revolutionary worthies del[i]vered us from British bondage, and rescued this nation from the thraldom of a corrupt hierarchy, from the tyranny of a mad King and of a proff[l]igate Prince.  
“The present war is a contest undertaken in defence of rights not less essential and for privileges not less dear.  
“It is commenced under circumstances by far more auspicious and promising a happy issue. With perseverance union and courage on the part of our citizens, the result we may venture to predict will be equally glorious.  
  
“Under these circumstances is it not absurd to withhold our support to government because another power besides England has injured us? Do the decrees of France afford a justification of the orders in Council? By this mode of reasoning the United States are made the football of the belligerents. On this subject the ground taken by the Congress of the United States is the true American ground, and the only one which a nation that respects itself should take. In the language of Congress we repeat ‘that the United States must act as an independant nation and assert their rights, and avenge their wrongs according to their own estimation of them, with the party who commits them, holding it responsible for its own misdeeds, unmitigated by those of another.’  
“Your Committee are not insensible to the calamities of war, neither are they dead to the rights and independance of their Country. They view war as an evil, but as an evil infinitely less then [sic] the surrender of our rights, or a quiet submission to the violation of them. For thirty years the United States have enjoyed peace; so long have they enjoyed it and so patient have they been in the endurance of wrongs that the belligerents have believed that the love of peace and the desire of gain were paramount to every other consideration with the American people. The British Government has believed that the people of the United States were so dependent upon British commerce, so wedded to foreign luxuries and so base in principle that to use a vulgar expression of an ignoble mind ‘they could not be kicked into a war.’  
“Have we not reason to believe the disavowal of Erskine’s agreement by the British government was mad[e] in consequence of the opposition made to the Embargo, and in consequence of the belief that the United States would not go to war? Indeed, we should be warranted in declaring, that all the embarrassments this country now suffers, and the necessity of the present war, has been produced by the unreasonable opposition to the measures of our own government. This consideration alone is sufficient to induce a more general support of it. Opposition at this time should be discountenanced as productive only of national calamnity. Let it be remembered that the restless men who now exclaim against the goverment, have been as hostile to every measure it has adopted as they now are to the war. They opposed the Embargo before it could have an effect, they have opposed the war before it could be known in Europe. Their only desire seems to be [to] aggrandize themselves on the ruins of the Union, and their only fear that the British goverment would be compelled to do us justice. They know that their existence as a party depends upon British aggression.  
“Your committee have no doubt that there is a settled determination on the part of certain leading and influential federal men in New England to dissolve the union of the States. It is a cause of pain and regret to us that any men in our country have so contemptible an opinion of the United States and such a blind attachment to Britain as to harbour so nefarious a design. But the proofs of this conspiracy are so clear that its existance cannot now be denied. It has been long matured and the faction concerned in it, have only waited for a period of national calamity to carry their des[i]gns into execution. With this view they have attempted to make the national government odious, to represent that the eastern states are oppressed and to hold up the government of Britain, our ancient oppressor, as the champion not only of liberty but of religion. In confirmation of our statement we need only refer to the proceedings of the legislature of this Commonwealth in 1809, and to the resolvs of various towns during that year, recommending a resistance to the laws and a seperation of the States. The transactions of the leaders of the opposition, since the declaration of war, prove that this plan of division has not been abandoned. A convention has been held by the federal party in this county, professedly to oppose the war but in the opinion of your committee it was set on foot to prepare the minds of the people for the sad catastrophe of a dissolution of the Union. A state convention has been proposed by that body, and this too in a Commonwealth where the choice of officers is annual, and immediately subsequent to an election.  
“A convention unknown to the Constitution, and without an object as your committee conceive, unless it be to concert means to resist the government and prostrate the Union. Your Committee have no fears of the result—the struggle for the Union may be an arduous one, but the fabric of Washington is not to be overturned by desperate party men.  
“Without making proffessions of patriotism which they do not feel, without claiming any higher respect for the honor and independence of the Country than should belong to every citizen of the republic; your Committee recommend an united an ardent support of the national goverment, as they conceive that not only patriotism, but duty and personal security require it.  
“Considering that one of those occurrences, pointed out by the great father of his country, in his parting address, may produce commotions we cannot forbear to recommend to all classes of people, of whatever political party, a frequent recurrence and a filial reverence of his advice. And to pause, and ponder upon that part wherein he says, that ‘In contemplating the causes which may disturb our union, it occurs as matter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished for charactizing parties by geographical discriminations. Northern and Southern Atlantic and Western: whence designing men may endeavour to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views—one of these expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourselves to[o] much against the jealousies and heart burnings which spring from those misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection.  
“‘All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct controul, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and w[h]olesome plans, digested by common council, and modified by mutual interests.’  
“If justice should mark the footsteps of the new ministry of England we shall hail the day as a jubilee when we can with honor renew the ties of friendley intercourse with England. But a change of ministry in England, heretofore has produced very little alteration in her commercial and mar[i]time systems. It is a fair conclusion that the orders in council against which America has uniformly complained have become so odious and destructive to England as well as America as to have been the great cause of the change of Ministry. Still this system may not be abandoned, and our joy at the removal of the most corrupt ministry that ever disgraced a nation, may be without much foundation and a ministry may be formed that will adopt measures towards us which will call for the opposing energies of the people of United America.  
“The public mind ought to be directed at this time, to the correspondence between the Secretary of State Mr. Munroe, and the British Minister Mr. Foster immediately preceding the declaration of War—and which may be considered as the pivot upon which that important question turned. The President haveing been satisfied that the Milan and Berlin Decrees were revoked, or modified so as not to effect America the American Government in that event required of the British Government a repeal of the orders in Council; to which this unequivocal answer was given by Mr. Foster; ‘America as the case now stands has not a pretence for claiming from Great-Britain, a repeal of her orders in council. She must recollect that the British Government never for a moment countenanced the idea that the repeal of these, could depend upon any partial or conditional repeal of the decrees of France. What she always avowed was her readiness to recind her orders in council as soon as France rescinded absolutely and unconditionally her decrees’—Thereby involving America in the European conflict from which, France has been willing and has proved by the most solem avowal, that she is ready to consider America as an exception.  
“A revocation therefore of the French decrees, as it respects America, will not be followed by a repeal of the orders in council, unless the new ministry should listen to the voice of justice, and of the English nation, and abandon the old wicked system. A tame and quiet submission to these orders of the British Cabinet, would be a satire upon the principles of the revolution, and would start from their peaceful abodes, the shades of Washington, and the heroes of the revolution.  
“These orders of the British cabinet have been condemned by a formidable part of the people of England, and are, it is presumed, at this time, without advocates on the other side of the atlantic. But in the County of Hampshire, a section of the country, least affected by commercial restrictions, the orders in council still find warm and able advocates, and the old ministry are not yet g[i]ven up.  
“Upon this view of the domestic situation of the United States, and of our relations with foreign powers, your committee reccommend to this convention the adoption of the following resolutions.  
“Resolved, That the veneration and gratitude of the whole American nation, are justly due to the present administration of the general government for their ‘ceaseless and solicitous exertions for the welfare of our common country’; that we have never felt at any former period, a more cordial zeal in seconding their measures; that we hasten to declare to this administration, our unqualified approbation of this just and necessary war; that we give them our hands and hearts at such an eventful crisis, pledging ourselves in behalf of every democratic citizens in the counties we represent, that they will support a government so dear to them, in resisting foreign aggression, or in crushing domestic treason.  
“Resolved, That whereas the government of Great Britain commenced a war against the United States in the year 1806, and have continued it to this time, although they have withheld the declaration thereof, we cannot view without indignation the base assertion that ‘the government of the United States have plunged our country into an offensive war,’ which is daily reiterated in the British prints in the United States, and by their influential patrons in public and private life; solemnly denouncing the same as a treacherous and malignant falshood.  
“Resolved, That the opposition to the existing measures of the national government in these counties has in its extent been grossly misrepresented, that it is in a great measure factitious, far exceeding in its clamorous and blustering tone and manner, any thing of the kind ever before exhibited by that faction; that we can assure the government and our fellow citizens at large, that this opposition is not so very formidable and alarming, even in this La Vendée of the American union, and the declaration so often repeated by Tories, that any of the ‘former friends’ of the general administration here are abandoning them, at this important crisis, is another disgraceful falshood.  
“Resolved, That the charge that the American government have in any public measure, been under the dominion of a partiality to France, is founded in the suspicion only of their enemies, the partizans of Britain and contradicted by positive evidence contained in the public documents, and that we do not entertain the least doubt, that our government is determined to avenge the wrongs inflicted upon our country by France, unless the negociations now pending should speedily eventuate in an honorable adjustment of her unjustifiable aggressions upon our commerce.  
“Resolved, That we cannot conscientiously approve of the proceedings of the majority of the house of representatives in this Commonwealth at the late session, relative to our national affairs, considering them neither wise nor patriotic, as they have a tendency to disunite the people, to counteract the supreme law of the land, to encourage our foreign enemy and to prolong the calamities of war.  
“Resolved, That the recent address of the Senate of Massachusetts to their constituents, comprizes the principles which ought to animate every state government and every citizen of the union, and that it deserves our warmest applause.  
“Resolved, That in the present state of our country, threatened by foreign and domestic enemies, we deem it highly expedient as well as our imperious duty, to appoint committees of safety and correspondence in every town in these counties and to raise a fund to defray the unavoidable expences connected with a measure of this nature.  
“Resolved, That we consider all meetings and conventions for the purpose of opposing the general government and the laws of the union, as dangerous during the existence of the present war and highly criminal, and that in case the leaders of the federal party should call a state or New-England convention according to their contemplated plan, we solemnly declare that we shall regard such an act as a preparatory step on the part of our domestic enemies to organize a force for the destruction of every thing dear to us and that we shall take such decisive measures as so alarming a crisis will imperiously demand.  
“Resolved, That we view with inexpressible abhorrence, the recent attempts made in this section of the union to oppose the constituted authorities of the nation, in pursuance of the orders of a few restless and unprincipled individuals in the town of Boston, being the same factious citizens who in April 1811 declared that a law of the United States must and would be resisted, and that the tories of the last war, are now foremost in aiding those disorganizers in the circles in which we have had an opportunity of witnessing the proceedings of their coadjutors and slaves.  
“Resolved, That we deem it too late as well as wholly irrelavant to be told at this unexampled crisis by the miserable apologists for the wrongs inflicted upon our beloved country, by the corrupt government of Great Britain, (wrongs which cry even to Heaven for vengeance) ‘that we are the descendants of the British nation—and that she is the bulwark of the religion we profess,’ a nation that has for ages sustained the character of lawless conquerors and pirates; which whenever her power would admit, has carried the terror of her arms to every land and sea; which, in a barbarous seven years war in conjunction with her natural alies the American Indians burnt our cities and towns, slaughtered our armies, butchered and scalped our defenceless men, women and children; which has annihilated the independence of the brave and generous people of Ireland, and doomed her worthiest citizens to the scaffold; which, has laid waste the fairest provinces of India, and murdered millions of her inoffensive inhabitants; which has in latter times without any pretext but that of tyrannical violence, impressed thousands of our seamen, and consigned them to the most ignominious servitude on board her floating castles of cruelty; which has swept American commerce from the ocean, has attempted to rally the traitors of our Country under the banner of John Henry, to dismember the union, and thereby to produce a civil war and a re-colinization of the New England states, and has again let slip the dogs of savage war, to spread dessolution and havoc among the citizens of our frontiers, and under whose fatal alliances the continent of Europe is now bleeding to death—with a government already exhibiting a decaying mass of corruption, which will probably soon become food for worms, and be consigned to the same just grave that has swallowed up other despotisms.  
“Resolved, That this report and resolutions be signed by the Moderator and Secretary of this convention—and that the Secretary be directed to forward a copy thereof to the President of the United States, and to cause the same to be published in the Democrat printed in Northampton

At a Convention of Reftuhlican Delegate&#x27;s,  
consisting of one hundred and fbrty-two  
members, from fifty-one towns, in the late  
County of Hampshire, comprising the eoun­  
ties of Hampshire, Franklin ami Hampden,  
convened at the Court-House in Northamp­  
ton, on the 20th day of July inst. at 11 o’­  
c. ck, A. AT. to counteract the effects of a  
Convention, holden at the same fitace on the  
14th instant—Samuel IluFFiscroit, F.ey.  
was unanimously chosen Aloderator, and  
Thomas Shepherd Secretary of the Con­  
vention. The following report and resolu­  
| lions, were unanimously adopted :  
1&#x27;hs Committee, afipointed by a delegation  
of Republican Citizens assembled at  
Urest- Springfield, on the 13th inst. to take  
into consideration the causes of the fire­  
sent War with Great Britain, and the  
combinations which are believed to exist  
tv dissolve the firesent ha/ifiy Union of  
the States, and to firesent the result of  
their deliberations to a Republican Con­  
vention to be held at Northampton on the  
20.7/ inst. from all the towns in the for­  
mer county of Hampshire, have attended  
Chat service, and beg leave to submit the  
following Report and Resolutions :  
A I&#x27;TER an attentive perusal of the docu*  
meats submitted to Congress by the  
President of the IJ. States, it most clearly  
appears, that both England &amp;. France have,  
tor several years, violated the neutral  
lights, insulted the flag, and depredated up­  
on the lawful commerce of the IJ. States  
on the high seas : That Great Britain, in  
addition to tin; outrages done on the ocean,  
has committed the most atrocious violences &#x27;  
within our own waters, impressed our sen-!  
men and excited the savages to an iodised-}  
ninate massacre of the inhabitants of our  
lVontiers.  
  
The government of the United States,  
actuated by a sincere disposition to remain  
u.t peace with all the world, have attempt­  
til, by negociation, commenced and prose­  
cuted in a spirit of amity and impartiality,  
t i settle all our differences with both the  
l-.illigcrents. Those powers* blind to their  
trie policy, and regardless of justice, have  
refused to comply with our reasonable terms &#x27;  
of accommodation. France, inflamed by a ■  
blind rage against England is resolved to I  
destroy British commerce, and England,  
governed not only by a mortal hatred a-&#x27;  
gainst Franco, but jealous of the prosperity [  
of thr American Republic, is determined to I  
establish for herself a monopoly of com­  
merce and the dominion-of the seas. That  
this view of the designs of (treat Britain is  
corrert we need only advert to the notori­  
ous fact, that while she has been cutting up  
American commerce by the roots, while!  
she has been depriving us of an adequate  
market for the great staples of our country,  
while she has seized our merchantmen and i  
condemned our property in her prize courts,  
under the pretext of retaliating on her e­  
nemy, she has herself carried on an exten­  
sive trade wiili that enemy under licences  
and forged papers. In many instances the  
very cargoes of American property, owned  
and freighted by American citizens, after  
being condemned in England Under the Or.  
ders in Council, have been shipped to thct  
Continent of Europe and sold for the bench  
of the captors.  
In this way docs F,n gland retaliate on  
her enemy, by seeking every corrupt oppor­  
  
tunity of trading with her in the merchan­  
dize plundered from the citizens ot the U.  
States.  
&#x27;1 o submit to such injustice while we  
have the power to resist, would he to sui ren­  
der our independence without a struggle­  
A degree of degradation to which the U. S.  
are not reduced, and by the permission of!  
the Almighty, we trust they never will be. [  
When by the valor of the American pen- |  
pie, crowned by the blessing of God. the |  
United States were severed trern the Bri-i  
tish yoke ; they acquired all the rights and !  
privileges of an independent nation. After  
the expulsion of the British tr.iia our shores, i  
those rights and privileges were acknow­  
ledged to belong to our republic bv the pow­  
ers ot the world, not excepting G. Britain  
herself.  
  
Among&#x27; those lights thus guaranteed,  
those of navigating the ocean under the  
known laws of nations, and of protecting the  
live^, liberty and property&#x27;of our citizens in  
the pursuit of a lawful commerce, were al­  
ways deemed most sacred. To violate  
these by any nation is an act of war, and to  
refuse to make reparation for the wrong by j  
the offending party is a just and righteous  
cause for war on the pat t of the injured.—  
There is no doubt then, that the U. States  
have just cause of war against England and  
Trance; but sound policy required that we  
should not be burthened by a war with tw#  
powerful nations at once. Congress, there­  
fore, wisely selected England as our ene­  
my, she being the first and the greatest ag­  
gressor.  
England, by her Orders in Council, has  
given a fatal stab to the freedom of com­  
merce, has violated the laws of nations, and.  
under pretexts the most futile, has exerci­  
sed the rights of sovereignty over us. In  
the impressment of seamen sailing under  
the protection of the American ilag she has  
trampled upon the personal liberty of the  
[citizen, and entered with ruthless violence  
the sanctuary of our Independence, drag­  
ging her victims to slavery and to death.—  
In employing the savages to murder our  
I people, a fart which is confirmed by the tes­  
timony of Governor Harrison, and which n#  
1 one’ean doubt who knows the influence the  
British have over the Indian tribes, she has  
shewn that she disregards those maxims  
which ought to govern civilized nations—  
Tn sending a secret agent among us to plot  
with the disaffected a dismemberment of  
the. Union ; she has convinced the world  
that she makes use of means to accomplish  
her nefarious purposes at once the most a­  
trociousand the must despicable.  
With these just grounds for war, With  
such powerful inducements to rally round  
the ark of our independence and defend it;  
it is a matter of astonishment to us that any |  
men that claim to be Americans should be  
so entangled in the toils of party, so lost to !  
themselves, so dead to the injuries inflicted  
upon their country as to deny the justice of  
this war altogether.  
Your committee are fully convinced that  
the present war is not only just but neces­  
sary and unavoidable. Even, however, drd ■  
they dcsibt of the necessity or polic/of the i  
war, they should hold it to be their duty,  
now that war has been resorted to, to sup­  
port the government in it, in order that our 1  
riders might have a fair chance to obtain an ‘  
acknowledgement of our rights. Every i  
other expedient has been tried in vain to1  
bring the belligerents to a sense of jus- j  
tice, and nothing remained to choose but I  
war or unconditional and base submission. ;  
It the war of the revolution was just, this !  
war is not less so. That was a war against 1  
arbitrary taxation of the British Parliament, i  
It was a war for Independence. It was a i  
war for liberty and equal rights. It was  
begun in honor and ended in glory. At the :  
commencement of it, clouds am! darkness  
hung over the country; our internal enemies,,  
those ill-omened birds of night were conti- I  
nually croaking around ; ruin, devastation  
and death were the burthen of their song—  
but the genius of America triumphed and  
left her sons a rich inheritance, cemented  
by the blood of her heroes. I ,et no one say  
that this prize was not worth contending  
for. We have reason to thank God that  
the noble virtues and exemplary courage  
of the revolutionary worthies delivered us  
from British bondage, and rescin d this na« j  
tion from the thraldom of a corrupt hierar­  
chy, from the tyranny of a mad King and of  
a profligate Prince.  
The present war is a contest undertak n  
in defence of rights not less e&#x27;Tential, and  
lor privileges not less dear, it is commen­  
ced under circumstances by far more auspi- I  
cions and promising a happy issue. With  
perseverance, union and courage on the  
part of our citizens, the result We may  
venture to predict will he equally glorious. ’  
Under these circumstances is it not ab­  
surd to withhold our support to government  
because another power besides England has  
Injured us f Do the decrees of France af­  
ford a justification of the Orders in Coun­  
cil ? By this mode of reasoning the United ;  
St? te? are made the foot-ball of the belli­  
gerents. On this subject the ground taken !  
by the Congress of the United States, is the  
true American ground, and the only one!  
which a nation that respects itself should j  
take. In the language of Congress we re-’  
peat “ thatthe United States must act as!  
an independent nation and assert their I  
rights and avenge their wrongs according to i  
their own estimate of them, with the party J  
who commit- them, holding it responsible!  
for its own misdeeds unmitigated by those  
of another.”  
  
Your Committee are not insensible to the  
calamities of war, neither are they dead to  
the rights ami independence of their coun­  
try. They view war as an evil, but as an  
evil infinitely less than the surrender of our  
rights, or a quiet submission to the violati  
on of them. For thirty years the United  
States have enjoyed peace ; so long have  
they enjoyed it nnd so patient have they  
been in the endurance ot wrong, that tin  
belligerents have believed that the Invc o‘  
peace fc the desire of gain were paramount  
to every other considerat on wi ll the Arne*  
rican people. The British government has  
believed that the people of the U. S. were  
so dependent upon British commerce, so  
wedded to foreign luxuries, ami so base in  
principle that to use a vulgar expression of  
an ignoble mind “ they could not b • kicked  
into a war,’*  
  
[ Iipvc mc m t r&#x27;M.rn t» believe the disa­  
vowal cf Eiskinc’s agreement by the-Ini­  
t:s!i government was made in consequence  
die opposition made to tlie Embargo, ami  
in consequence of the belief that the United  
Srates would not go to war ? Indeed,  
should be warranted in declaring, that all­  
| the embarrassments this country now suf­  
| let s and the necessity of the present war,  
Iliad been produced by the unreasonable op*  
position to the measures of our own govern-,  
i incut. , his considet at&#x27;.ou alone is sufficient  
to indure a more general support of it. Op*  
position at this time should be disccuntcnan.  
[ltd as productive only of national culnmif.  
Uet it be remembered that the restless men  
who now exclaim against the government,  
have been as hostile to every measure it has  
adopted as they now are to the war. Ther  
[opposed the Embargo before it could have  
an eftect, they have opposed the war before  
mV could he known in Europe. Their only  
’ desire seems to be.to aggrandize themselves  
on the ruins of the Union, and their only  
i tear that the British government would be  
compelled to dp us justice. They know  
  
tuat their existence us &lt;» party depends upon  
British aggression.  
j \our committee hev no doubt that there  
is a settled determination on the part of cer­  
tain leading and influential federal men in  
New-Bngland to dissolve the uiiun of th®  
States. It is a cause of pain and regret Vo  
us that any men in our country have so cor -  
temptiole an opinion of the United Stap s  
and such 3 blind attachment to Britain as  
to harbour so nefarious a design. But- ihe  
proofs of this conspiracy are so clear that  
its existence cannot now be denied. It, has  
been long matured and the faction cnnitevn­  
rd in it, have only waited for a perifid of  
national calamities Jo carry their dcsirps in­  
to execution. With this view vheyha&#x27;jfe at­  
tempted to make the national government  
odious, to represent that the eastern states  
are opposed and to hold up the govern­  
ment of Britain, our ancient oppressor, as  
the champion not only of liberty but of re­  
ligion. Jn confirmation of our statement  
we need only refer to the proceedings of  
the Legislature of this Commonwealth in  
180b, anti to the resolves of various towns  
during that year, recommending resis­  
tance to the laws and a separation of the  
States.  
1 he transact ons of the leaders of the op­  
position, since the declaration of war, prov e  
that this plan of division has not been aban­  
doned. A convention lias been held by the  
lederal parly in this county, professedly to  
oppose the war, but in the opinion of your  
committee ?t was set on foot to prepare the  
minds of the people for the sad catastro­  
phe of a dissolution of the Union. A state  
convention has been proposed by that body  
and this too in a Commonwealth where the,  
choice of officers is annual, and immediate­  
ly subsequent to an election. A convention  
unknown to the Constitution, and without  
an object, as your committee conceive, un­  
less it be to concert means to resist the go­  
vernment and prostrate the Union. Your  
Committee have no fears of the result—the  
struggle tor tile union may be an ardous  
one, but the fabric of Washington is not to  
be overturned by desperate party men.  
\\ itliout making professions of pati iotism  
which they do not foel, without claiming a­  
ny higher respect for the honor and inde­  
pendence of tlie country than should be.long  
to every citizen of the republic ; your Com -  
mittee recommend an united, an ardent sup­  
port of ti * national government, as they  
conceive that not only patriotism, but duty  
and personal security require it.  
tfonsid.ring that one of those occurrrn­  
  
c.es, pointed out by the great father of bis  
country, in his parting address, may pro­  
duce coin motions, v\ e cannot forbear to re­  
commend to all classes ot people, of whate­  
ver political party, a frequent recurrence  
and a filial reverence of his advice. And  
to pause, and ponder upon that part where­  
in he says that &quot; lit contemplating the cau­  
ses which may disturb our union, it occurs  
as matter of serious concern, that any  
ground should have been iurnished for cha­  
racterising parties by geographical discri­  
minations—Northern and Southern—At­  
lantic and Western : whence designing  
m&#x27;eii may endeavor to excite a belief that  
there is a real difference of local interests  
and views—one of these expedient of par­  
ty to acquire influence within {Articular  
districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and.  
aims of other districts. You cannot shield  
yourselves too much against the jealousies  
and heart burnings which spring fr&lt; m  
those misrepresentations ; they tend io  
render alien to each other those who ought  
to be bound together by fraternal affection.  
“ All obstructions to the execution of lho  
laws, all combinations and associations, un­  
der whate ver plausible character, with the  
real design to direct, controul, counteract,  
or awe tho regular deliberation and action  
of the constituted authorities, are destruc­  
tive of this fundamental principle, and of  
fatal tendency. They serve to organise,  
faction; to give it an artificial fone ; to  
put in the place of the delegated will of the  
nation, the will r&gt;f a party, often a small,  
but artful and enterprising minority of the  
community ; and according to the alternate  
triumph of different parties, to make the.  
public administration the mirror of the ill­  
concCrted and incongruous projects of fac­  
tion, rather than the organ of consistent  
and wholesome plans, digested by common  
council, and modified by mutual interests.”  
If justice should mark the footsteps of  
the new ministry of England, we shall hail  
the day as a jubilee when we can with ho­  
nor renew the ties of friendly intercourse  
with England. But a change of ministry,  
maritime system.—It is a fair conclusion  
that the rider* in &lt; ouncil, hgnir.st which  
America has uniformly complained, have  
become so odious and destructive to Eng­  
land as well as America, us to have been  
the great cause of the change of Ministry.  
Still this system may not (&gt;** abandoned, and  
nur joy at the removal of the most corrupt  
ministry that ever tiisgtared a nation, jnay  
b * wit lout much fo n ation, and a ministry  
may be formed that win adopt measures  
towards us which will Call for the opposing  
energies of the people of United Ameri­  
ca.

this time, to the correspondence between  
the Secretary of State Mr. Monroe, and the  
British Minister Mr. Foster, immediately  
preceding the declaration of War—ami  
which may l&gt;e considered ns the pivot up­  
on which that important question turned.  
The President having been satisfied that  
the Milan and Berlin Decrees were revo­  
ked, or modified sows not to affect Ameri­  
ca, the American Government in thnte­  
vent required of the British Govcrrn­  
ment a repeal the Orders in Council  
to which this unequivocal answer was  
given by Mr. Foster ; “ America sk  
the case now stands has not a pretence for  
claiming from Great Britain, a repeal of  
Her orders iu council. She must recollect  
that the British Government never for a  
moment countenanced the idea that the re­  
peul of those, could depend upon any parti­  
al or conditional repeal of the decrees of  
France. VYhat she always avowed was  
her readiness to rescind her orders in coun­  
cil as soon as France rescinded ubso­  
sulutcly and unconditionally her decrees.”  
— Thereby involving America in the Kuro­  
peau conflict, from which, France has been  
willing, and has proved by the most solemn  
avowal, that she i3 ready to consider Ame­  
rica as an exception.  
A revocation, therefore, of the French  
decrees, as it respects America, will not  
be followed by a repeal of the orders in  
council, unless the new ministry should lis­  
ten to the voice of justice, and of the Kn­  
gtish nation, and abandon the old wicked  
system.  
A tame and quiet submission to those or­  
ders of the British Cabinet, wopid be a  
satire upon the principles of the revolution,  
and would start from the peaceful abodes,  
theshades of Washington, and the heroes oj  
the revolution.  
  
These orders of tlie British cabinet, have  
been condemned by a formidable part of  
the people of England, and arc, it is presu­  
med, at this time, without advocates on the  
other sidy, of the Atlantic. But in this  
County ot Hampshire, a section of the coun­  
ty, least affected by commercial restricti­  
ons, the orders in council still fiind warm  
and able advocates, and the old ministry  
are nut yet g veil up.  
Upoh this view of the domestic situation  
«*t the United ijtates, and ot our relations  
with foreign powers, your committee recom­  
mend to this convention the adoption of the  
following rsolutioii!).  
Revolved, That the veneration &amp; grati­  
tude of the whole American nation are just­  
ly due to the present administration ot the  
general government for their “ ceaseless &amp;  
solicitous exertions for the welfare of our  
common country” ; that wc have never felt  
at any former period, a more cordial zeal  
in seconding their measures ; that we has­  
ten to declare to this administration, our  
unqualified approbation of this just and ne­  
cessary war ; that we give them our hands  
and hearts at such an eventful crisis, pledg­  
es out selves on behalf ot every democratic  
citizen in the counties we represent, that  
they will support a government so dear to  
them, in resisting foreign aggression, or in  
crushing domestic treason.  
Revolved, That whereas the government  
of Great Britain commenced a war against  
the United States in the year lt&gt;06^ and  
have continued it to this time, although they  
have withheld the declaration thereof, we  
cannot view without indignation the base  
Assertion that “ the government of the U­  
rnted States have plunged our country into  
an offensive war,” which is dailv reiterated  
in the British prints in the United States  
ami by (their influential patrons in public  
and private lite ; solemnly denouncing the  
same as a treacherous and malignant fals­  
hood.  
Revolved, &quot;1 hat the opposition to the ex­  
isting measures of the national government  
in these counties, has in its extent been  
grossly misrepresented, that it is in a great  
measure factitious, far exceeding in its cla­  
morous and blustering tone and manner, a­  
ny thing of the kind ever before exhibited  
by that factum ; that we can assure the go­  
vernment and our fellow citizens at large  
that this opposition is not so very (formida­  
ble and alarming, even in this La Vendee  
Of the American union, and that the de­  
claration so often repeated by Tories, that  
any of the “ former friends” of the general  
administration here, arc abandoning them,  
at tiiis important crisis, is another dis’  
gr iccful falsehood.  
  
J\esolz&gt;cd, rhat the charge that the A­  
m erica a government have in any public  
measure, been under the dominion of a par­  
tiality to France, is founded in the suspicion  
only of their enemies, the partizans of Brit­  
ain anil contradicted by positive evidence  
contained in the public documents, and that  
we do not entertain the least doubt, that  
our government is determined to avenge  
the wrongs inflicted upon our country by  
France,auilcss the negociations now pen­  
ding shtrald speedily eventuate in an honor­  
able adjustment of her unjustifiable aggres­  
sors upon our commerce.  
Resolved, That we cannot conscientious­  
ly approve of the proceedings of the major­  
ity-of the house of representatives in this  
Commonwealth at the late session, relative  
to our national affairs, considering them  
neither wise nor patriotic, as they have a  
tendency to disunite the people, to counter­  
act the supreme law of the land, to encou­  
rage our foreign enemy and to prolong the  
calamities of war.  
Resolved, That the recent address of  
the Senate of Massachusetts to their con­  
stituents, comprizes the principles which  
ought to animate every state government,  
and every citizen of the union, and that it  
deserves our warmest applause.  
Resolved, That in the present state of our  
Country, threatened by foreign and domestic  
enemies, we doent it highly expedient as!  
well as ouv imperious dirty, to appoint com­  
mittees of safety and correspondence in eve­  
ry town in these counties and to raise a fund  
to defray the unavoidable expenr.es connec­  
ted with a measure of this nature.  
Resolved, That we consider all meetings  
and conventions for the purpose of opposing  
the general government and the laws of the  
union, as dangerous during the existence of  
the present war and highly criminal, and  
that in case the leaders of the federal part­  
should call a state or Ncw-England conven­  
tion according to their contemplated plan,  
we solemnly declare that we shall regard  
such an net ns a preparatory step on’tlie  
part of our domestic enemies to organize h  
force for the destruction of every thing dear  
to us, and that we shall take such decisive  
measures as so alarming a crisis will impe­  
riously demand.  
R^soliird, That we virw with inexptrs­  
•ible abhorrence, the recent attempts made  
ill this section of the union to oppose the  
const,;,ited authorities of the nation, in pur­  
suance cf the r rders of a few restle-s and  
unprincipled individuals in the town of  
JBoston, being the same factious citizens who  
  
in April 1811 declared that a law of the  
United States must and would be resisted,  
ami that the tories of the last war, are now  
b re most in aiding those disorganize) s in  
the circles in which we have had an oppor­  
tunity of witnessing the proceedings of their  
coadjutors and slaves.  
Hctolved, That we deem it too&#x27; late as  
well as wholly irrelevant to he told at this  
unexampled crisis by the miserable apolo­  
gists for the wrongs inflicted upon our belov­  
ed country by the corrupt government ofG.  
Britain, (wrongs which cry even to Heaven  
lor \« ngeance) “ that we are the descen­  
dants of the British nation-*—and that she is  
the bulwark of the religion we profess,” a  
I nation that lias forages sustained the cha­  
racter of lawless conquerors and pirates J  
which, whenever her power would admit,  
has carried the terror of her arms to every  
land and sea ; which, in n barbarous seven  
years war in conjunction with her natural  
allies the American Indians, burnt out* ci­  
ties and towns, slaughtered our armies,  
butchered and scalped our defenceless men,  
women and children ; which lias annihila­  
ted the independence of the brave aiul ge­  
nerous ppople ol Ireland, and doomed her  
worthiest citizens to the scaffold; which,  
has laid waste the fairest provinces of In­  
dia, and murdered millions of her inoffensive  
inhabitants ; which has in latter times  
without any pretext but that of tyrannical  
violence, impressed thousands of our seamen,  
and consigned them to the lpost ignominious  
service on board her floating castles of cru­  
elty ; which has swept American com­  
merce from the ocean, has attempted to  
rally the traitors of our country uuder the  
: banner of John Henry, to dismember t&#x27; u»  
nion, and thereby to produce acit • &amp;  
a re-coionization of tl&#x27;cNew Engl- ,ates,  
and has again let slip the dogs &lt; f Savage  
war, to spread desolation nnd it a c. r.mong  
the citizens of our frontiers, a d under  
whose- fatal alliances the continent of Eu­  
rope is now bleeding to death—with a go­  
vernment already exhibiting a decaying  
mass of corruption, which will probably  
soon become food for worms, aiul be con- j  
signed to the same just grave that lias  
swallowed up other despotisms.  
licaolved, That this report and resoluti­  
ons be signed by the Moderator and Secre­  
tary of this convention—and that the Se­  
cretary be directed to forward a copy there­  
of to the President of the United States, 6c  
to cause the same to be published in the  
Democrat printed in Northampton.

EROM THE DEMOCRAT :~July 21, 1812  
  
PROMPT PAT&#x27;RIOTISM.  
  
At a Convention of Republican Delegates,  
consisting of ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-TWO  
MEMBERS, from /fifty-one towns, in ;hzohte  
county of Hampshire, comprising the coun­  
ties of Hampshire, Franklin and Ilampden,  
convened at the Court-house in Northampton,  
on the 20th day of July wnst. at 11 o’clock, A.  
M. to counteract the effects of a convention  
holden at the same place on the 14th instant,  
Samuen BurriverTon, Fsq. was unanimous­  
ly chosen Moderator, and Tuomas Suxp­  
nerp, Secretary of the Convention. The  
foliowing repo:t and resolutions, were unani­  
mously adopted. _—  
lee Committee, approinted by a Delegation of  
Repubtican Citizens assembled at West-  
S/zrmg_ﬁ‘rld on the 13¢h inst. to take into  
consideration the causes of the firesent war  
with Great Britain., and the combinations  
which are believed to exist to dissolve the  
Jiresent happy union of the States, and to  
firesent the result of their deliberations, to a  
Republican Convention to be held at North­  
ampiton on the 20th insty, from all the towns  
in the former county of Hampshire, have  
attended that service, and beg leave to sub­  
mit ithe following refiort and resolutions :  
  
AFTER an attentive perusal of the documents  
submitted to Congress by the President of the Unit­  
ed States, it most clearly appears, that both England  
and France have, for several years violated the neu­  
tral rights, insulted the flag and depredated upon  
the lawful commerce of the United States on the  
high seas, That Great Britain, in addition to the  
outrages done on the ocean, has committed the most  
atrocious violences within our own waters, impress­  
ed our seamen, and excited the savages to an indis­  
criminate massacre of the inhabitants of our frontiers,  
The government of the United States, actuated by  
a sincere disposition 10 remain at peace with all the  
world, have attempted by negoclation, commenced  
and proseeuted in a spirit of amity and impartiality,  
10 settle all our differences with both the belliger­  
ents. These powers, blind to their true policy, and  
regardless of justice, have refused to comply with  
our reasonable terms of accommodation. France,  
inflamed by a blind rage against England, is resolv­  
ed to destroy British commerce ; and England, gov­  
erncd not only by a mortal hatred against Prance,  
but jealous of the prosperity of the American Re­  
public, is determined to establish for herself a mo­  
nopoly of commerce and the dominion of the seas.  
That this view of the designs of Great Britain is cor­  
rect, we need only to advert to the notorious fact,  
that while she has been cutting up American com­  
merce by the roots, while she has been depriving us  
of un a.detTu\te market for the great staples of our  
country, while she has seized our merchantmen and  
condemned our property in her prize courts, under  
the pretext of retaliating on her enemy, she has her­  
self carried on an extensive trade with that enemy  
under licenses and forged papers. In many instances  
the very cargoes of American property, owned and  
ﬁ&#x27;o&#x27;»ghtzd by American citizens, after being condemn­  
ed in Ea‘(md under the Orders in Council, have  
been st d,,%gu continent of Europe and sold  
&quot; for the captors.  
In this way does Englind retaliate on her.gßemy,  
by = every comupt opputtunity of trading  
with her in the merchandize plundered from the cit­  
izens of the United States.  
To submit to Rlch injustice while we have the  
sower to resist, would be to surrender our indepen­  
cuce without a struggle. A degree of degradation  
to which the United States are not reduced, and by  
the permission of the Almighty we trust they never  
will be. When by the valor of the American peo­  
ple, crowned by the blcu&#x27;m% of God, the United  
States were severed from the British yoke ; they ac­  
guircd all the rights and privileges of an indepen­  
ent nation. After the expalsion of the British from  
our shores, those rights and privileges wereacknowl­  
edyed to belong to our Republic I;y the powers of  
the world, not excepling Great Britain herself.  
Among those rights thus guaranteed, those of  
nnvigatinf the ocean under the known laws of na­  
tions, and of protecting the lives, liberty and pro­  
perty of our citizens in the pursuit of a lawful com­  
merce, were always deemed most sacred. To vio­  
late these by any nation is an act of war, and to ve­  
fuse to make vepuration for the wrong by the offend­  
ing party, is a Just and rightcous cause for war on  
the part of the injured. There is no doubt, then,  
that the United States have just cause of war against  
England and France ; but sound policy required  
that we should not be burthened by a war with two  
f*&quot;‘i&quot; nations at once.—Congress thercfore wise­  
ﬁy selected England as our enemy, she being the  
rst and the greatest aggressor,  
England by her Orders in Council has given a fatal  
stab to the freedom of commerce, has violated the  
laws of nations, dand under pretexts the most futile  
has exercised the rights of sovereignty over vs. In  
the impressment oF our searpen sailing under the  
protecrion of the American flag, she has trampled  
u‘i)on the personal liberty of the citizen, and enter­  
ed with ruthless violence the sanctuary of our inde­  
gendcnce. dragging her victims to slavery and to  
cath. In employing the savages to murder our peo­  
ple, « fuct which is confirmed by the testimony of  
Governor Harrison, and which no one can doubt wio  
knows the influence the British have over the Indian  
tribes, she has shewn that she disregards those  
maxims which sught to govern civilized nations—ln  
sending a secret agent among us to plot with the  
disaffected a dismemberment of the Union, she has  
convineed the world that she makes use of means to  
accomphish her nefarious purposes, at once the most  
.atrecious and most despicable,  
With these just grounds for war, with such pow­  
erful inducements to rally round the ark of our in­  
dependence and defend it; it is a matter of aston­  
ishment t» us that any men that claim to be Ameri­  
cans, should»tg:o entangled in the toily of ,80  
lost to themselves, 50 dead to the injuries m&amp;d  
upon &#x27;t.:.cir country to deny the justice of this war al­  
together.  
VOur committee are fully cohvinced that the present  
war is not anly just, but necessary and unavoidable.  
Even however did they doubt of the necessity or pol.  
icy of the war, they should hold it to be their duty,  
now ar has been resorted to, to support the  
ent in it, in order that our rulers might

den of their uonr!; but the pﬂl\n of Arherica tri­  
umphed and left her sons a rich inherit cemen­  
ted by the blood of herheroes. “lLet w%m  
this p‘he was not worth contending for—~We have  
reason to thank God that the noble virtues and cx.  
emplary courage of the revolutionary worthies deliv.  
ercd us from British bondage, and rescued this na­  
tion from the thraldom of a corrupt hierachy, from  
the tyranny of a wad King and of « profii Prince.  
‘The present war is a constest unde Ain de­  
fence or rights not less essential, and o |  
not less dear. It is commenced under Chcums R  
by far more auspicious, and promising a happy issue.  
With perseverance, union and courage on the part  
of our citizens, the result we may veiture 10 pre­  
dict will be equally glorious. 13  
Under these circumstances, is it not abmrd‘  
withhold our support to guvernment because anol  
power besides England has injured us 7 Dy the  
crees of France agord a justification of the ’  
in Council ? By this mode of reasoning the United  
States are made the foot ball of the betigerents. On  
this subject the ground taken by the Congress of the  
United States, is the true American ground, and  
the only one which a nation that respects itself should  
take In the language of Congress we repeat “ that  
the Uuited States must act as an independent nation,  
and assert their rights and avenge their wrongs aes  
cording to their own estimute of them, with the pars  
ty who commits them, holding it responsible for its  
own misdeeds unmitigated by those of another”  
Your committee ar¢ not insensible to the calami­  
ties of war, neither are they dead to the rights «nd.  
independence of their country. They view war 33  
an evil infinitely less than the surrender of our  
rights, or a quict submigsion to the violation of them.  
For thirty years the United States havg enjoyed  
peace ; so long have they enjoyed it and so patient  
have they been in the endurance of wrunf, that the  
belligerents have believed that the love of peace and  
the desire of gain were paramount te cvery other  
consideration with the American people. Fhe Brit­  
ish government have belicved that the people of the  
United States were dependent upon British commerce,  
s 0 wedded to foreign luxuries, and so base in prin­  
ciple, that to use a vulgar expression of an ignoble  
mind, *they could not be kicked into a war’  
Have we not reason to believe the disavowal of  
- Erskine’s arrangement by the British government  
was made in consequence of the opposition mnade to  
the Embargo, and in consequence ef the behef that  
the United States would not go to war ! Indeed, we  
should be warranted in declaring, that all the em­  
barrassinents this country now suffers, and the ne­  
cessity of the present war, have been produced by  
the unreasonable opposition to the measires of our  
own goveinment. This consideration alone iy sufficis­  
ent to induce a more geperal support of it. Oppo­  
sition at this time should bé discountenanced as pro.  
ductive only of national calamity. Letit be remems  
bered that the restless men wha now exclaim against  
the government, have been as hostile to every mea­  
sure it has adopted as they now are to the war.  
They opposed the Embargo before it could have m  
cticet ; they have opposed the war before it could be  
known in Europe. Their only desire seems to be to  
aggrandize themselves on the ruins of the thion,  
and their only fear that the British government would  
Le compelled to do us justice. They know that  
their existence as a party depends upon Brtish ag­  
gression,  
  
~ Your committee have no doubt there is a settied  
determinution on the purt of certuin leading and ine  
fuencial federal men in New-England to dissolve  
the union of the States. It is a cause of pain and  
regret to ws that any men in our country have so  
contemptible an opinion of the WUnited States, and  
spch « blind attachment to Britain, as to harbor so  
nefarious a design. But the proofs of this com&amp;ra­  
cy are so clear, that its existence cannot now be de­  
mied. It has been long mature ad the faction  
conceyned i it have onﬁv waited %‘sﬁod of nas  
tional calamity to carry their designs Intd execution,  
~&#x27;With this view they have attempied to make e na­  
tional government odious, to represent that the gas­  
tern States are oppressed, and to hold up the .  
ernment of Beitain, our ancient oppressor, the  
champion not only of liberty but of religion. In  
confirmatien of eur statement we need only refer to  
the rrocccdings of the Legislature of our Common­  
weaith in 1809, and to the resolves of various towns  
during that year, recommending a resistance to thé  
laws und a separation of the States.  
The transactions of the leaders of the opposiiion,  
since the declaration of war, prove that this plan of  
division has not been abandoned. A convenuon has,  
been beld by the federal party in this county, pro­  
fessedly to oppose the war, but in the opinion of  
your committee it was set on foot to prepare the  
minds of the people for the sad catastrophe of a dis- -  
solution of the Union. A state convention has been  
proposed by that body, and this too in a Common­  
wealth where the choice of officers is annual, and  
immediately subsequent to an election. A conven |  
ton unknown to the Constitution, and without an  
object, as your committee conceive, unless it be to  
concert means to resist the government and prostrate  
the Union. Your committee have ao fears for the  
result—the struggle for the Union may be an ardu­  
ous one, but the fubric of Waslingion is not over­  
turned by desperate party men,  
Without making professions of patriotism which  
they do not feel, without claiming any higher respee.  
for the honor and independence of the country than  
should belong to every citizen of the Republic ;  
your committee recommend an united, an ardent  
uufport of government, as they conccive that net  
only patriotism, but duty and personal sccurity re­  
quire it.  
  
i Considering that one of those occurances, pointed  
out by the great father of his country, in his parting  
address, may produce commotions, we cannot for  
bear to recommend to all classes of people, of what­  
~aver political party, a ffequent recurrence and a fil­  
isl reverence of his advice. And to pause, and pon­  
~der n‘pon that part wherein he says, that * In con­  
templating the causes which may disturb our union,  
it occurs as a matter of serious concern, that any  
ground should have been furnished for characterining  
parties by geograpoical discriminations— Northern  
and Southern—Atlantic and Western : whence de­  
signing wen may endeavor to excite a belief that  
there is a real dia&#x27;ercncc of local interests and views  
~one of these expedients of party to acquire influ­  
ence within particular districts, 1s to misrepresent  
the opinions and aims of other districts. You can­  
hot shield yourselves too much against the jealoun­  
sies and heart burnings which spring from those  
misrepresentations ; they tend to render alien to  
cach other, those who ought to be bound together  
by fraternal affections.  
“ All obstructions to the exccution of the laws, all  
combinations and associations, under whatever plau­  
sible character, with the real design to direct, con­  
trol, counteract, or awe the regular deliberstion and  
action of the constituted authorities, are destructive  
of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tenden­  
cy. They serve to organize faction; to givelbit  
artificial gorce; to put in the place of the dele&#x27;t!:!  
will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small,  
but artful and enterprizing minority of the commu­  
nity ; and according to the alternate trinmphs of dif­  
ferent parties, to nmke the public administration the  
mirror of the ill-concerted and inc:vl‘ﬂom projects  
of faction, r than the organ of consistant and  
whok-oom&amp; digested by common eouncil, and  
modified by mutual interests.”  
If justice should mark the footsteps of the new  
ministry of England, we shall hail the day as a jubi­  
lee when we can with honor renew the ties of friend­  
ly intercourse with England. But a of min­  
istry, in England, herctofore has produced very lit-  
  
&quot; &quot; &quot;‘., gt T .  
ee S gt  
S Loo ¥ &#x27; : i | Lol } .  
. ined, have become 30 odious and destructive tc  
g mx_&#x27;ﬂl s America, as to hive been the  
great cause of the of Ministry. Still this  
system may not be our joy at the  
removal o, the most that ever dis.  
graced a nation, m&amp; foundation,  
and &amp; ministry may adopt mea­  
ire to.:glu which w the opposing cui­  
tgies of the people of United America.  
_The public mind ought to be directed at thistime  
g the jondence between the Sceretary of State,  
e, and the British Munister, Mr. Foster,  
:ly preceding the doclaration of war—--and  
i W may be considered as the pivos upon which  
{ Mbat important question turned.  
- The President having been satisfied that the Milan  
and Berlin decrees were revoked, or modificd, so as  
not to affect America, the American Government,  
in that event, required of the British Government  
‘repeal of the orders in council ;to which this une­  
quivocal answer was given b{‘ Mr. Foster; * Ameri  
ca as the cuse now stands has not a prelence for  
cluiming from Great Buitain, a repeal of her Orders  
in Council. Bhe must recollect that the British goy­  
ermmment never for a moment countenanced the dlea  
that the repeal of those, could depend upon any par­  
tial or conditional repeal of the decrees of France.  
What she siways avowed, was ler readiness to re­  
| scind ber orders in council as soon as France rescin­  
ded absolutely and unconditienally her decrees’’—  
; Theteby involving America in the Buropean couflict,  
f?m ‘Kich, France has been willing, and has prov.  
ed by the most solemn avowal, that she is ready to  
consider America as an exce&#x27;ption.  
A rovocation, therefore, of the French decrees,as  
it respects America, will not be followed by a repeal  
of the orders in council, unless the new ministry  
shouid listen 16 the voice of justice, and of the Eng­  
lish nation, and abandon the old wicked system.  
A tﬁme% quiet submission to these orders of  
the British @binet,” would be a satire upon the prin­  
ciples of the revolution, and would start from their  
peaceful abodes, the shade of Washington, and the  
heroes of the revolution.  
These orders of (he British Cabinet, have been  
condemned by a formidable part of the people of  
England, and are, it is presumed, at this time, with­  
out advocates on the other side of the Atlantic. Bat  
in the county of Hampshire, a section of the coun­  
(ry least affccted by commercial restrictions, the or­  
ders in council still find warm and able advocates,  
and the old ministry is not yet given up.  
Upon this view of the domestic situatien of the  
United Stries, and of our relations with foreign  
powers, your committee recommend to this conven­  
ton the adoption of the following resolutions :  
\ Kesolved, I&#x27;hat the veneration and gratitude  
of the whole Ameiican nation, are justly due  
to the present administration of the general  
government for their ¢ ccaseless and selici­  
tous exertions for the welfare of our common  
country ;” that we have never felt at any for­  
mer period, a more cordial zeal in seconding  
their measures ; that we hasten to declare to  
this administration, our unqualfied approba­  
tion of this just and necessary war ; that we  
give them our hands and hearts at such an e­  
ventlul crisis, pledging our lives in behalf of  
every democratic citizen in the counties we  
represent, that they will support a povern­  
nmient so dear tothem, in resisting foreign  
aggression, or in crushing domestic treason.  
Kesotved, That whereas the Government of  
Great Britain commenced a war against the  
United Staes in the.yglir 1306, and have con&lt;  
tnued it to this time, although they have  
withield the declaration thercof, we cannot  
view without indignation the base assertion,  
that ® the governmcent of the United States  
have plunged our country into an offensive  
war,” which is daily veiterated in the British  
t prints in the United States, and by their in­  
fuentigl patrons in public and private life ;  
solemuly denouncing the same as a treacher­  
ouns and maligmant falsehood.  
~ Resolved, ‘l&#x27;hat the opposition to the exist­  
ing measures of the national government in  
these counties, has in its extent been grossly  
misrepresented, that it is in a great measure  
factitious, Liv exceeding in its clamorous and |  
blustering tone and manner, any thing of the  
kind ever before exhibited by thut faction ;  
that we can assure the government and our  
fellow-citizens at large, that this opposition is  
not so very lormidable and alarming, even in  
this L.a Vendee of the American union, and  
that the declaration so often repeated by To­  
ries, that any of the “ former fricnds” of the  
general administration here, are abandoning  
taem, at this important crisis, is another dis­  
graceful falsehood.  
Resolved, That the charge that the Amer­  
ican government have in any public measure,  
been under the dominion of a partiality to  
France, is founded in the suspicion only of  
their enemies, the partizans of Britain, and  
contradicted by positive evidence contained in  
the public documents, aud that we do not en­  
tertain the least doubt, that our government  
is determined to avenge the wrongs inflicted  
upen our country by France, unless the nego­  
ciations now pending should speedily eventu­  
ate in an hovorable adjustment of her Gnjusi­  
ifiable aggressions upon our commerce.  
. Resolved, That we cannot conscientiously  
approve of the proceedings of the majority  
of the House of Representatives in this Com­  
monwealth at the late session, relative to our  
national aluirs, considering them neither  
wise nor patriotic, as they have a tendency  
to disunite the people, to counteract the su­  
preme law of the land, to encourage our for­  
eign enemy, and to prolung the calamitics of  
&#x27;aro  
  
Resolved, That the recent address of the  
Senate of Massachusetts, to their constity­  
€T, comprises the principle which ought te  
animate cvery state government, and every  
iizen of the union, und that it deserve our  
est applause.  
esolved, That in the present state of our  
country, threatened by foreign and domestic  
enemies, we deem it highly expedient as  
well as our imperious duty, to appoint com­  
mitiees of safety and correspondence in every  
town in these counties, and to raise a fund to  
defray the unavoidable expenses connected  
with a measure of this nature.  
  
Resolved, That we consider all meetings  
and conventions for the purpose of opposing  
the géneral government and the laws of the  
unian, as dangerouns during the existence of  
  
, 8, ’  
the present w:.t highly eriminel; and  
that the vs of the leuerzal pany’  
call 8 State or New-F nglunc Cenven­  
-lion,: ing W their contemplaied plan, u  
.nhmu&quot;y declare that we shall regard such an  
act as a preparutory siep on the pa ouv  
~domestic enemies, 10 orgenize &amp; lor;&#x27; the  
destruction of every thing dear 10 us, ond  
that we shall wke such decisive Masut’s as  
so wlarming a crisis will iniperiously degmand.  
Resolved, That we view with Inexprdsm  
abhorrence, the recent stiempts made ig this  
scction of the Union 10 oppose the constitute  
ed authoiities ol the nation, In buisusnce of  
the orders ol a lew restless and unprincipled  
individuals 1o the town of Bosten, being l#  
same facuicus citizens who, in Apiil, 1817,  
declared that a law of the United States ‘  
aud weuld be resisted ; and that the corimf  
the last war, are no{v foremost in -Idﬁng those  
disorganizers in the circles in which we have +  
“had an opportunity of witnessing the pro­  
ceedings of their coadjutors and slaves. |  
Kesolved, That we deem it 100 late as well  
as wholly irrelevant to be told at this unexam-&quot;  
pled crisis, by the miserable apologists for the  
wrongs inflicted upon our beloved counury,by  
the corrupt government of Great Britain,  
wrongs which ery even to Heaven for vens  
geance, ‘“ that we are the descendants ol tf‘  
Lvitish »ation=—and that she is the bulwark of  
the religion we profess;” a nationghar has for  
ages sustuined the character of lawless come  
~querors and pirates 3 whichy wheneyer her  
~ power would admit, has carried the terror of  
her arms tg every land and sea ; which, in  
the barbarous séven years war in conjunction  
with her natural allies the American Indians,  
burnt our cities and towns, slaughtered our  
armies, butchered and scalped our defence­  
less men, women and children ; which has  
annibiluted the independence of the brive  
and generous people of Iveland, and doomed  
her woithiest citizens to the scuffold ; which  
has laid waste the fuirest proviwces oi Indis,  
and murdered mithons of ber ‘inoffensive  
inhabitants ; which has in letter tmesawitheus  
any pretext, but that of ity ennical viclence,  
&#x27;mpressed thousands of our seamen, and con­  
signed them to the most ignominious seryi­  
tude on board her floating castles of cruelty ;  
which bas swept Americun commerce from  
the ogean, has attempted to rally the traitors  
of our country under the bunner of John  
Hernry, to dismember the union, and thereby  
to produce a civil war and re-colonization of  
the New-England States, and has again let  
slip the dogs of Savage war, to spread deso­  
lation “and havoc among the citizens of our  
frontiers, and under whose fatal ulliances the  
continent of Europe is now bleeding to death  
—-with a government already exbibiting a de­  
cayed mass of corruption, which will soon  
become food for worms, und be consigned to  
the same just gr%’ve that has swallowed up  
other despotisms, ,  
Resolved, That this report and resolutions  
be signed by the Moderator and Secrewcy of  
the convention—and that the Secretary be di+  
rected to forward a copy thereof to the Pres­  
ident of the United States and cause the same  
to be published.

other, is a proof,of their love of peace, of  
their moderation, and of the hope which  
they still indulged, that friendly appeals  
to jusi and generous sentiments would  
not be made to them in yain. But the  
motive was mistaken, if their forbear-  
ance was imputed, either to the want of  
a just sensibility to their wrongs, or ofa  
determination, if suitable redress was  
not obtained, to resentthem. The time  
has now arrived when this system of  
reasoning mst cease. It would be in-  
sulting to repeat it—It would be degra-

must act as an independent nation, and  
assert their rights and avenge their  
wrongs, according to their own esti-

mits them, holding it responsible for its

They serve to organize faction ; to give

gts&#x27;cd by common council, and modi­

The Address concludes with the fol­  
lowing Resolutions :  
Restive J, That the veneration and  
gratitude of the whole American nation,  
are justly due to the present adminis­  
tration of the-general government for  
tbeif w ceaseless and solicitous exer­  
tions for the welfare of our common

.our unqualified approbation of this just  
and necessary war ; that we give them

ful crisis, pledging ourselves in behalf  
of every democratic citizen in the coun  
ties we represent, - hat they will support  
a government o dear to them in resis  
ting foreign aggression, or in crushing  
domestic treason.  
Resolved, tint whereas tne gnrern  
mem ol ureat li itain commenced.  
war against the u. btates in the year  
1806, and have continued it to this time  
although they have withheld the decla  
ration thereof, we cannot view without  
indignation the base assertion that u the  
government of the United States have  
ptunsjed our country into an offensive  
war,&quot; which Is daily reiterated in the  
British prints in the United Stater, and  
by their influential patrons in public and  
private life ; solemnly denouncing the  
same as a treacherous and malignant  
falshood.  
Resolved, That the .opposition to the  
existing measures of the national gov  
emment in these counties, has in its ex  
tent been grossly misrepresented, that it  
is in a great measure factitious, far ex­  
ceeding in it&amp; clamorous and blustering  
tone and manner, any thing of the kind  
ever before exhibited by that faction ;  
that wc can assure the government and  
our fellow citizens at largo, that this op  
position is not so very formidable and a-  
larming, even iri this L.a Vendee of the  
American Union, and that the declara  
tion si often repeated by Tories, that  
any of the former friends&quot; of the ge  
neral administration here, arc abandon  
ing them, at this important crisis, is an  
other disgraceful falsehood  
lUsolved, That the charge that the  
American government have in any pub  
lic measure, been under the dominion of  
a partiality to France, is founded in the  
suspicion only of their enemies, he par  
tizans of Britain, and contradicted by  
positive evidence contained in the pub-  
lie documents, and that we do not en  
tertain the least doubt, that our govern-  
mtnt Is determined to avenge the wrongs  
inflicted opoo our country by France,  
unless the negotiations now pending  
anouia speeouy eventuate in an n on or a

Constituents, ; comprises&#x27; the principles  
wmcn ougni. to amiaaic crcrv eioic  
vernment.&#x27;-and every citizen of theju­

Resolv ed, That in the present state  
df our country,&#x27; threatened by foreign and  
domestic&#x27; enemies we deem it highly-  
expedient as&#x27; well ay our imperious du­  
ty, to appoint committees 6f safety and  
correspondence : in .ihese counties, and  
to raise a tuna tooetray tne unavoiaaoie  
expences. connected with a measure of  
this nature. .  
, Resolved, That -we consider all meet­  
ings and conventions for the purpose of  
opposing the general government and  
the aws of the union, as dangerous du­  
ring the existence of the present war,  
and highly Criminal; and. that in case  
the leaders of the federal party &#x27;should  
call a state or New-England convention  
according to their contemplated plan,  
we solemnly dtclare that we shall regard  
such an act as a preparatory step on tbt  
part of our domestic enemies to organ­  
ize a force for the destruction of every  
thing dear to us, and that we shall take  
such decisive measures as so alarming  
a crisis will imperiously demand.  
. Rco&#x27;v&#x27;ed, That wc view with inex­  
pressible abhorrrence the recent attempt  
made in this section of the union to op­  
pose the constituted authorities of the  
nation, in pursuance of the orders of a  
few restlessd unprincipled individuals  
in the towrfm Bsstop, being the same  
factious citizens who, in April,&#x27; 18 1 1,  
declared that a law of the United S ates  
must and would be resisted ; and that  
the tories of the last war, are now fore­  
most in aiding those disorganizes in the  
circles in which we have had an oppor­  
tunity of witnessing the proceedings of  
tbeir coadjutors and slaves.  
Resolved, That we deem it too late,  
as well as wholly irrelevant, to be told at  
this unexampled crisis, by the miser­  
able apologists for the wrongs inflicted  
upon our beloved country, by the cor­  
rupt government cfG. Britain (wrongs  
which cry even to Heaven for vengeance,  
that we are the descendants of the Bri­  
tish nation and that she is the bulwark  
j of the religion we profess,&quot; a nation that  
has for agts sustained the character of  
lawless conquerors and pirates ; which  
whenever her power would admit, has  
carried the terror of her arms to every  
land and sea ; which, in a barbarous  
seven years war in conjunction with her  
natural allies the American Indians,  
burnt our cities and towns, slaughtered  
our armies, butchered and scalped our  
defenceless men, women and children ;  
which has annihilated the independence  
of the brave and generous people of  
Ireland, and doomed her worthiest citi­  
zens&#x27; to the scaffold ; which has laid  
waste the fairest provinces of India, and  
murdered millions of her inoffensive in­  
habitants ; which has in latter times  
without any pretext but that of tyranni­  
cal violence, improved thousands of our  
seamen and consigned them to the most  
ignominious servitude on board hrr float­  
ing castles of cruelty , which has swept  
American commerce Trmi the ocean, ,  
has attempted to rally the traitors of our  
country under the banner of John Hen  
ry, to dismember the union, and thereby  
to produce a civil war and are-colonization  
of the New-England States, and has  
again Ut slip the dogs of Sivagewar,  
to spread desolation and havoc among  
the citrz -ns f our frontiers, and under  
whose fatal alliances the continent of  
Europe is now bleeding to death with  
a government already exhibiting a de­  
caying mass of corruption, which wilt  
probably soon become food for worms,  
and be consigned to the same just prve  
that has swallowed up other despotisms.  
Resolved, That this report and reso­  
lutions be signed by the Moderator and  
Secretary of this convention and that  
the Secretary be directed to forward a  
copy thereof to the President of the U­  
nited States and to cause the same to  
be published
