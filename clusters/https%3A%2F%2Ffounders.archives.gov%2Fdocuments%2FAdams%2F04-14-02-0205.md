		Washington, 21 November, 1800.  
				  
				I arrived here on Sunday last, and without meeting with any accident worth noticing, except losing ourselves when we left Baltimore, and going eight or nine miles on the Frederick road, by which means we were obliged to go the other eight through woods, where we wandered two hours without finding a guide, or the path. Fortunately a straggling black came up with us, and we engaged him as a guide, to extricate us out of our difficulty; but woods are all you see, from Baltimore until you reach the city, which is only so in name. Here and there is a small cot, without a glass window, interspersed amongst the forests, through which you travel miles without seeing any human being. In the city there are buildings enough, if they were compact and finished, to accommodate Congress and those attached to it; but as they are, and scattered as they are, I see no great comfort for them. The river, which runs up to Alexandria, is in full view of my window, and I see the vessels as they pass and repass. The house is upon a grand and superb scale, requiring about thirty servants to attend and keep the apartments in proper order, and perform the ordinary business of the house and stables; an establishment very well proportioned to the President’s salary. The lighting the apartments, from the kitchen to parlours and chambers, is a tax indeed; and the fires we are obliged to keep to secure us from daily agues is another very cheering comfort. To assist us in this great castle, and render less attendance necessary, bells are wholly wanting, not one single one being hung through the whole house, and promises are all you can obtain. This is so great an inconvenience, that I know not what to do, or how to do. The ladies from Georgetown and in the city have many of them visited me. Yesterday I returned fifteen visits,—but such a place as Georgetown appears,—why, our Milton is beautiful. But no comparisons;—if they will put me up some bells, and let me have wood enough to keep fires, I design to be pleased. I could content myself almost anywhere three months; but, surrounded with forests, can you believe that wood is not to be had, because people cannot be found to cut and cart it! Briesler entered into a contract with a man to supply him with wood. A small part, a few cords only, has he been able to get. Most of that was expended to dry the walls of the house before we came in, and yesterday the man told him it was impossible for him to procure it to  
  
be cut and carted. He has had recourse to coals; but we cannot get grates made and set. We have, indeed, come into a new country.  
				You must keep all this to yourself, and, when asked how I like it, say that I write you the situation is beautiful, which is true. The house is made habitable, but there is not a single apartment finished, and all withinside, except the plastering, has been done since Briesler came. We have not the least fence, yard, or other convenience, without, and the great unfinished audience-room I make a drying-room of, to hang up the clothes in. The principal stairs are not up, and will not be this winter. Six chambers are made comfortable; two are occupied by the President and Mr. Shaw; two lower rooms, one for a common parlour, and one for a levee-room. Up stairs there is the oval room, which is designed for the drawingroom, and has the crimson furniture in it. It is a very handsome room now; but, when completed, it will be beautiful. If the twelve years, in which this place has been considered as the future seat of government, had been improved, as they would have been if in New England, very many of the present inconveniences would have been removed. It is a beautiful spot, capable of every improvement, and, the more I view it, the more I am delighted with it.  
				Since I sat down to write, I have been called down to a servant from Mount Vernon, with a billet from Major Custis, and a haunch of venison, and a kind, congratulatory letter from Mrs. Lewis, upon my arrival in the city, with Mrs. Washington’s love, inviting me to Mount Vernon, where, health permitting, I will go, before I leave this place.  
				The Senate is much behind-hand. No Congress has yet been made. ’T is said ——— ——— is on his way, but travels with so many delicacies in his rear, that he cannot get on fast, lest some of them should suffer.  
				Thomas comes in and says a House is made; so to-morrow, though Saturday, the President will meet them. Adieu, my dear. Give my love to your brother, and tell him he is ever present upon my mind. / Affectionately your mother,

Washington, Nov. ‘2l, 1800.  
Mr. Dkar Chii.d:— 1 arrived here on  
Sunday last, and without meeting with any  
accident worth noticing, except losing our­  
selves when we left Baltimore, and going  
eight or nine miles on the Frederick road,  
by which means we were obliged to go  
the oilier eight through woods, where we  
w andered two hours w ithout finding a guide  
or the path. Fortunately a stragling black  
came up with us, and we engaged him as  
a guide to extricate us out of our difficul­  
ty; but woods are all you see, from Balti­  
more until you reach the city. which is  
only so in name. Here and there is a  
small cot, without a glass window, inter­  
spersed amongst the forest, through wnich  
you travel miles w ithout seeing a human  
being. In the city there are buildings  
enough, if they were compact and finished  
to accommodate Congress and those at­  
tached to it; but as they are, and scattered  
as they are, l see no great comfort for  
them. The river which runs up to Alex­  
andria; ii in full view of my window, and  
l see the vessels pass and repass, The  
house is upon a grand and superb scale,  
requiring about thirty servants to attend  
and keep the apartments in proper order,  
and perform the ordinary business of the  
house and stables—an establishment well  
proportioned to the President’s salary.—  
The lighting the apartments from the  
kitchen to parlor and chambers, is a tax  
indeed, and the fires we are obliged to  
keep to secure us from the daily agues is  
another very cheering comfort, lo assist  
us in this great castle, and render less at­  
tendance necessary, bells arc wholly want­  
ing. not one single one being hung in the  
whole house, and promises are a!l you can  
  
obtain. i his is so great an inoonvenie;  
that Ido not know what to do. &#x27;i he I  
dies from Georgetown and in the citv :*avv  
many of them visited me. Yesterday, :  
repaid fi.teeil visits; but such a pin  
Georgetown appears—why, our M:\
beautiful. But no comparisons; it   
will put me up some bells, and let me have  
wood enough to kiep files, l design to be  
pleased, i could content myself almost  
jujv where lor three months; but, sur­  
rounded with forest, can vou believe that  
wood is not to be bad, b.-cause people can­  
not be found to cut and cart it? Briesler  
entered into a contract with a man to sup­  
piy him with wood. A small part, three  
cords only has he been able to get. Most  
of that was expended to dry the walls of  
the house beloro wc came in, and yester­  
d.i\ the man told him that it was impossi­  
ble lor him to procure ;t to be cst and cart­  
ed. lie has had a resource to coals; but  
we cannot get grates made and set. \\ e  
have, indeed, come into a new country.  
A on must keep all ibis to yourself, and  
when asked how I like it, say that I write  
\ ou tiie situation is beautiful, which is true.  
Ulie house is made habitable, but there is  
riot a single apartment finished, and all  
withinside, except the plastering, has been  
done since Brcslcr came. \\ e have not  
the least fence yard, or other convenience  
without, and the great unfinished audience­  
room I make a dry’ room of, to hang up  
clothes in. i lie principal stairs aro not  
up, and will not he this winter. Six cham­  
bers are made comfortable; two, are occu­  
pied by the President and Mr. Snaw; two  
lower rooms, one lor a common parlor,  
and one fora levee room. Upstairs there  
is the oval-room, w hieh is designed for the  
d.au mg-room, and has the crimson furni­  
ture in it. It is a handsome room now,  
but w hen completed it will be beautiful.—  
It the twelve years in which this place has  
been considered the future seat of Govern­  
mer.t had been improved, as they would  
have been in New England, very’ manpol  
the present inconveniences would have  
been removed. It is a beautiful spot, ca­  
pable ol every improvement,and the more  
1 view it the more I am delighted with it.  
Since l sat down to write, 1 have been  
called down to a servant from Mount Ver­  
non, with a billd Irom Major Curtis, and  
a haunch of venison, and a kind congratu­  
laory letter irom Mr. Lewis upon my ar­  
rival in the citv, with .Mrs. \V asliington’s  
love, inviting me to Mount Vernon, where  
health permitting, l will go before 1 leave  
this place.  
Ibe Senate is much behind hand. No  
Congress has yet been made. ’ Pis said

“You must keep this to yourself, and, when asked how

which is true. The house is made habitable, but there is

chambers are made comfortable ; two are occupied by the  
President and Mr. Shaw; two lower rooms, one for &amp;

there is the oval room, which is designed for the drawing-  
room, and has the crimson furniture in it. It is a very  
handsome room aow; but when completed, it will be  
beautiful. If the twelve years, in which this place has

pass and repass. The house is upon a grand and superb scale,  
requiring about thirty sen ants to attend and keep the apartmenu  
in proper order, and perform the ordinary business of the house  
and stables; an establishment very&#x27;well proportioned to the Pres¬  
ident’s salary. The lighting the apartments, from the kitchen to  
the parlors and chamhm, is a tax indeed; and the fires we are  
ohlig^ to keep to secure ns from daily agues, is another very  
cheering comrort. To auist ns in this great castle, and render  
less attendance necessary, bells are wholly wanting, not one being  
hung through the whole house, slid promises are all we can ob¬  
tain. This is so groat an inconvenience that I know not what to  
do, or how to do. • • • If they will put me up some bells,  
and let pne have wood enough to keep fires, I design to be pleased.  
I could content myself anywhere three months, but surroundwl by  
forests, can yon believe that wood is not to be had, because people  
eannot he found to cut and cart it t Bricsier entered into a con¬  
tract with a man to snppiv him with wood. A small part, a few  
cords only, has he been able to get. Most of that was expended  
to dry the walls of the house before we came in, and yesterday the  
man told him it was impossible for him to procure it to be cut and  
carted. He has had recourse to coals; but wo cannot get grates  
made and sot. We hare indeed come kito a new countrg.”

of the fact that they were lost in the woods be¬  
tween Baltimoi*c and Washington, and a de  
scription of the desolate appearance of every¬  
thing she saw on the road, she says: “The  
house is on a grand and superb scale, requiring  
about thirty servants to attend and keep the  
apartments in proper order, and perform the  
ordinary business of the house and stables—an  
establishment very well proportioned to the  
President’s salary. The lighting the apart¬  
ments from the kitchen to parlors and cham¬  
bers is a tax indeed; and the fires we are  
obliged to keep to secure us from daily agues  
is another very cheering comfort. To assist us  
in this great castle, and render less attendance  
necessary, bells are wholly wanting, not one  
single one lieing hung through the whole house,  
and promises are all you can obtain. This is  
so great an inconvenience that I know not  
what to do. or how to do it. The ladies from  
Georgetown and in the city, have many of  
them visited me. Yesterday I returned fifteen  
visits. * • • • no compari¬  
  
sons ; if they put me up bells, and let me have  
  
wood enough to keep fires, I Hetigntd to be jHeaxd.  
But, surrounded with forests, can you believe  
that wood is not to be had, because people can¬  
not be found to cut and cart it * * *  
We have, indeed, come into a neic country.  
  
“ The house is made habitable, but there is  
not a single apartment finished; and all within-  
side, except the plastering, has been done since  
B. came. We have not the leasl fence, yard, or  
convenience without, and the great unfinished  
Audience Room, (East Room) I make a drying  
room of to hang up clothes in. * * *  
It is a beautiful spot, capable of any improve¬  
ment, and the more I view it the more I am  
delighted with it.”  
  
If Mrs. Adams actually kept thirty servants,  
and that in a place where, from its location  
and newness, and the fact that most persons of  
condition in the vicinity owned their own  
servants, they must have been far from the  
best; and her position, domestically considered,  
far from enviable. There are bells now, and,  
as we have stated, most of the conveniences  
which Mrs. Adams complained were wanting

but there are no fences, gardens, nor the least appearance of business. This  
place is about a mile and a half south of the Capitol.”  
  
President Adams (the elder) arrived in Washington with his family Novem-  
ber of the same year. On the 25th of that month, Mrs. Adams wrote a letter  
to her daughter, Mrs. Smith, in which she thus speaks of the President’s  
house :  
  
‘*The house is made habitable, but there is not a single apartment finished,  
and all within side, exeept the plastering, has been done since B. came. We  
have not the least fence, yard or convenience without, and the great unfinished  
audience-room I make a drying-room of, to hang up the clothes in.”  
  
An old friend, who was familiar with the city as far back as 1800, and for  
many years before, informs the editors that the Pennsylvania avenue, between  
the Capitol and the President’s House, was at that time a perfect quagmire. H

ter lady has had the courage, a society lady says,  
in these hard times, to wear the same hat that  
she did last winter., Tho diary of Sirs. Adams  
would indicate that she could do as bravo a  
thing. * How the White House looked to Abigail  
Adams upon entering it, she tells In these words ;  
  
The house Is upon a grand and superb scale* re­  
quiring about thirty servants to attend and keep  
the apartment? in proper order, and perform the  
ordinary business of the house and stable*—an  
establishment very well proportioned to the Presi­  
dent’s salary. The lighting the apartments, from  
the kitchen to parlors and chambers, is a task in­  
deed, and the fires we are obliged to keep, to se­  
cure us from dally agues, is another very cheering  
comfort. To assist us in this castle, and render  
less attendance necessary, bells arc wholly want­  
ing, not one single one being hung through the  
whole house, ana promises are aU you can ootaln.  
This is go great an inconvcnicnco that I know not  
what to do or how to do. The’ladles from George­  
town, and in the city, have many of them visited  
me. Yesterday i returned fifteen visits. But each  
a place as Georgetown appears! Why, our Milton  
is beautiful. But no comparisons; if theyputmeup  
bells and let me have wood enough to keep fires, I  
design to be pleased. But, surrounded with forests,  
can you believe that wood is not to be ha&lt;), because  
people cannot be foupd to cut and cart it? . , .  
Wehave, indeed, come Into a new country. , . ,  
The house is made habitable, but there is not a  
single apartraentfinisbed, and all within side, except  
the plastering, has been done since B. came. .  
. . If the twelvcyears in which tblsplace has been  
considered os the future seat of Government, had  
been improved as they would have been in New  
England, very many of the present inconveniencios  
would have been removed. It is a beautiful spot,  
capable of any Improvement, and the more I view  
it the more 1 am delighted with it

&#x27;Washington, Nov. 21, 1800.  
&quot;My Deajt Child:  
&quot;I arrived here on Sunday last, and with­  
out meeting with any accident worth men­  
tioning, except losing ourselves when we  
left Baltimore, and going eight or nine miles  
on the Frederick road, by which means we  
were obliged to go the other eight through  
woods, where we wandered two hours with­  
out finding a guide, or a path fortunately,  
a strangling black came up with us, and we  
engaged him as a guide to extricate ns from  
our difficulty. But woods&#x27;arc all you see  
from Baltimore until you reach the city,  
which is only so in name.  
&quot;Here and there is a small cot without a  
glass window, interspersed among the forests,  
through which you travel miles without  
seeing any human being. In tbe city there  
are buildings enough if they were compact  
and finished, to accommodate Congress and  
those attached to it; but as they are, and  
scattered as they ate, I see no great comfort  
in them. The river which runs tip to Alex­  
andria is in full view fiom my window, and  
I see the vessels as they pass and repass.  
The house is upon a grand and superb scale,  
requiring about 30 servants to attend and  
keep the apartments in proper order, and  
perform the ordinary business of the home  
aud stables; an establishment very well pro­  
portioned to the Presidential salary.  
&quot; The lighting of the apartments, from the  
kitchen to the parlors aud chambers, is a  
tax indeed; and the fires we are obliged to  
keep to secure us from daily agues is  
another very chcering-comfort.  
&quot;To asfeiit us in this great castle, and ren­  
der les3 attendance necessary, bells are  
wholly wauling; not one single one being  
hung through the whole house, and promises  
are all you can obtain. This is so great an  
inconvenience that I do not know what to  
do, or how to do.  
&quot;The ladies in Georgetown, aud in the  
city, have, many of them, visited me. Yes­  
terday 1 returned 15 visits; but such a  
place as Georgetown appears! why our Mil­  
ton is beautiful but no comparisons. If  
they will put me up some bells and let me  
have wood enough to keep fires, I design to  
be pleased. I could content myself any­  
where for three mouths; but surrounded by  
forests, would you believe that wood is not  
to be had, because people cannot be found to  
cut and cart it? Bteislcr entered into a  
contract with a man to supply him with  
wood. Asmall part a few eords only has  
he been able to get. Most of that was ex­  
pended to dry the walls of the house before  
we came in, and yesterday the man told him  
it was impossible to procure it cut and  
carted for him. He has recourse lo coals,  
but we cannot get grates made aud set.  
We Lave, indeed, come into a new country.  
&quot;You muit keep this all to yourself, and  
when asked how 1 like it, say that I write  
you that  
THC SITUATION IS BEAUTIFUL,  
which is true.  
&quot;The liouee is made habitable, but there  
is not a single apartment finished; and all  
inside, except the plastering, has heen done  
since Brcisler came. We have not the least  
fence, yard, or other convenience without,  
aud the great unfinished audience-room I  
make a drying-room of, to hang up the  
clothes in. The principal stairs are not yet  
up, and will not be this Winter. Six cham­  
bers are made comfortable. Two are occu­  
pied by the President and Mr, Shaw, two  
lower rooms&#x27;ono for a common parlor, one  
for a. levee-room. Upstairs, there is the  
oval room, which is designed for thedrawing-room,  
and lias the crimson furniture in  
  
it. It is very handsome now, hut&#x27; when  
completed it will he beautiful.  
&quot; If the 12 years in which this place has  
been considered as the future seat of Govern­  
ment, had heen improved, as they&quot; would  
have been, if in New England, very many of  
the inconveniences would have been re­  
moved.&quot; It is a beautiful spot, capable of every  
improvement, and the more I view it, the  
more I am delighted with it.  
&quot;Since I sat down to write, I have been  
called down to a servant from Mount Ver­  
non, with a billet from Mnj. Custis, and a  
haunch of venison, and a kind congratula­  
tory letter from Mrs. Lewis, upon my ar­  
rival in the city, with Mrs. Washington&#x27;s  
love, inviting me to Mount Vernon. When  
health permitting, I will go before leaving  
this place.  
&quot; Two articles we are much distressed for;  
the one is bells, but the more important is  
wood, yet you cannot sec wood for trees
