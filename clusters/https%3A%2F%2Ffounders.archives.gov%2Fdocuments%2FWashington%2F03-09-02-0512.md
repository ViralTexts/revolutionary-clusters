Morristown May 24th 1777.  
  
I beg leave to inform Congress, that immediately after the receipt of their Resolve of the 26th of March, recommending the Office of Adjutant General to be filled by the Appointment of a person of Abilities, and unsuspected attachment to our Cause, I wrote to Colo. Timothy Pickering of Salem, offering him the post in the first instance, and transmitting at the same time a Letter for Colo. William Lee, whom Congress had been pleased to mention, to be delivered him in case my offer could not be accepted. This conduct, in preference of Colo. Pickering, I was induced to adopt, from the high character I had of him, both as a great military genius, cultivated by an industrious attention to the study of War, and as a Gentleman of liberal education—distinguished zeal &amp; great method and activity in Business. This character of him, I had from Gentlemen of distinction &amp; merit, and on whose Judgement, I could rely. When my Letter reached Colo. Pickering, at first view, he thought his situation in Respect to public Affairs, would not permit him to accept the post. That for Colo. Lee, he sent immediately to him, who in consequence of it repaired to Head Quarters. By Colo. Lee, I received a Letter from Colo. Pickering, stating more particularly the causes which prevented him accepting the Office, when it was offered, and assuring me, that he would in a little time accomodate his Affairs in such a manner, as to come into any Military post, in which he might be serviceable &amp; thought equal to. Here I am to mark with peculiar satisfaction, in justice to Colo. Lee, who has deservedly acquired the reputation of a good Officer, that he expressed a distrust of his abilities to fill the Appointment intended for him, and on hearing that Colo. Pickering would accept it, he not only offered but wished to relinquish his claim to it, in favor of him, whom he declared, he considered from a very intimate &amp; friendly acquaintance, as a first Military character and that he knew no Gentleman better or so well qualified for the post among us. Matters being thus circumstanced, and Colo. Lee pleased with the command he was in, I wrote Colo. Pickering on his return, who accepted the Office &amp; is daily  
  
expected. In this business, I beg Congress to be assured, though Colo. Lee was postponed in the first instance, their recommendation had it’s due weight, and that no motive other than a regard to the service, induced me to prefer Colo. Pickering. His acknowledged abilities and equal zeal, without derogating from the merits of Colo. Lee, who holds a high place in my esteem, gave him a preference, and I flatter myself the Cause will be promoted in his Appointment; especially as we shall have two Good Officers in Lieu of One, &amp; who I am persuaded, will do honour to themselves in the lines in which they move.

office of Adjutant General to be filled by the appointment of a person  
of abilities and unsuspected attachment to our cause, I wrote to  
Col. TrmotHy PickERING, of Salem, offering him the post, in the

war, and as a gentleman of liberal education, distinguished zeal, and  
great method and activity in business.”
