Sir,  
						London, August 4th. 1808.  
					  
					The St. Michael arrived at Falmouth on Thursday the 14th. of last Month, after a Passage of eight Days from L’Orient. Captain Kenyon delivered to me on Wednesday the 20th. (upon my Arrival in Town  
						from Brighton, where I had been for a short Time on Account of my Health) your Letters of the 30th. of April, and your private Letter of the 8. of May, together with Newspapers, printed Copies of the  
						Embargo Act &amp; its Supplements, and of Papers laid before Congress at their last Session. Mr. Hall brought me a Letter from General Armstrong of the 26th. of June (of which I send an Extract) and  
						Mr. Upson brought me a private Letter from him, with the following postscript of the 1st. of July, &quot;An order has been received from Bayonne to condemn eight other of our Ships &amp;c.&quot;  
					On Friday the 22d. of July I had an interview with Mr. Canning; and renewed my Efforts to obtain a Revocation of the British orders of January &amp; November 1807, and of the other  
						Orders dependent upon them.  
					I have already informed you, in my private Letter of the 29th. of June, that on the Morning of its Date I had a long Conversation with Mr. Canning, which had rendered it somewhat  
						probable that the object mentioned in your Letter of the 30th. of April (of which I had received a Duplicate by the Packet) would be accomplished, if I should authorize the Expectation which that Letter suggests; but that some Days must elapse before I could speak with any  
						Thing like Certainty on the Subject: and I have mentioned in another private Letter (of the 10th. of July) that it was understood between Mr. Canning &amp; myself that another Interview should take place soon after the prorogation of Parliament. In Effect, however, Mr.  
						Canning was not prepared to see me again until the 22d. of July, after I had been recalled to London by the Arrival of the St. Michael, and had in Consequence reminded him of our Arrangement by a private Note.  
					In the Interview of the 29th. of June I soon found it necessary to throw out an Intimation, that the Power vested in the President by Congress, to suspend the Embargo Act &amp; its Supplements, would be exercised as regarded Great  
						Britain, if their Orders were repealed, as regarded the United States. To have urged the Revocation upon the mere Ground of strict Right, or of general Policy and there to have left the Subject, when I was authorized to place it upon Grounds infinitely  
						stronger; would have been, as it appeared to me, to stop short of my Duty. Your Letters to Mr. Erskine (which Mr. Cannning has read &amp; considered) had exhausted the first of these Grounds, and endless Discussions here, in every Variety of Form, in and out of parliament,  
						had exhausted the second. There was, besides, no Objection of any Force to my availing myself without Delay of the powerful Inducements, which the Intimation in Question was likely to furnish to Great Britain, to abandon her late System; and it seemed to be  
						certain that, by delaying, to present those Inducements to Mr. Canning’s Consideration, I should not only lose much Time, but finally give to my Conduct a disingenuous Air, which, while it must be  
						foreign to the Views &amp; Sentiments of the President, could hardly fail to make a very unfavourable Impression upon the Minds of Mr. Canning and his Colleagues. I thought, moreover, that,  
							if I should reserve the Suggestion for a late stage of our Discussions, it would be in order to wear the Appearance of a Concession reluctantly extorted, rather than of what it was, the spontaneous Result of the  
							characteristic Frankness &amp; honourable Policy of our Government.  
					The Intimation once made, a complete Development of its natural Consequences, if properly acted upon, followed of Course, and, taking advantage of the Latitude afforded by the informal Nature of a mere Conversation, I endeavoured to make  
						that Developement as strong an Appeal as consistently with Truth &amp; Honour I could (and there was no Necessity to do more) to the Justice &amp; the Prudence of this Government. It was not possible however, that Mr. Canning could  
						require to be assisted by my Explanations. It was plain, upon their own Principles that they could not equitably persevere in their Orders in Council, upon the Foundation of an imputed Acquiescence on our Part in French Invasions of our  
						Neutral Rights, when it was become (if it was not always) apparent that this Imputation was completely &amp; in all Respects an Error, when it was manifest that those Orders, by letting loose upon our  
						Rights a more destructive &amp; effective persecution than it was in the power of France to maintain, interposed between us &amp; France, furnished Answers to our Remonstrances against her Decrees &amp; Pretexts for those Decrees, and stood in the Way of  
						that very Resistance which Great Britain affected to inculcate as a Duty at the Moment when she was taking the most effectual Measures to embarrass &amp; confound it, and when it was also manifest that a Revocation of those Orders would,  
						if not attended or followed by a Revocation of the Decrees of France, place us at Issue with that Power, &amp; result in a precise tion, by the United States to such parts of her  
						anti-commercial Edicts as it became us to repeal.  
					In a Prudential View my Explanations seemed still less to be required. Nothing could be more clear than that, if Great Britain revoked her Orders, &amp; entitled herself to a  
						Suspension of the Embargo, her Object (if it were any Thing short of the Establishment and aclical Support of an exclusive Dominion over the Seas) must in some Mode or other  
							be accomplished, whether France followed her Example or not. In the first Case, the avowed Purpose of the British Orders would be fulfilled, and Commerce would resume  
							its accustomed Prosperity &amp; Expansion. In the last, the just Resistance of the United States (more efficacious than that of the British Orders) to French Irregularities &amp; Aggressions, would be left to its  
						fair operation (and it was impossible to mistake the Consequences) while the Commercial Intercourse between the United States &amp; Great Britain being revived, would open the Way for a Return to good Understanding,  
						and, in the End, for a Ajustment of all the Differences.  
					These, and many

with a View to a more accurate Comprehension of my Purpose. He asked if I thought of taking a more formal Course than that which I was now pursuing; but  
							immediately remarked that he presumed I did not; for that Course I had adopted was undoubtedly best suited to the Occasion. I told him that I was so entirely persuaded that the Freedom of Conversation was so much better adapted to the  
						Nature of our Subject, &amp; so much more likely to conduct us to a a beneficial Result, than the Constraint &amp; Formality of written Communication, which usually grow into protracted Discussion, &amp; always occasioned Embarrassment  
						when there was any thing of Delicacy in the Topics that I had not intended to present any Note.  
					This Interview (in the progress of which some other points were incidentally touched upon, as mentioned in my private Letter of the 29th. of June) did not authorize any very confident Opinion that Mr. Canning approved of what had now for  
						the first Time been suggested to him; and still less could it warrant any anticipation of the final opinion of his Government. But the Manner

t Misunderstandings in the Bay of Passamaquoddy. I  
						told him that I had no Intelligence, official or private, of these Transactions, which he would perceive took place upon our Borders, a great Distance from the Seat of Government, and that, of course, I could only express my Conviction that the Government of the United States  
						would disavow whatever was improper in the Conduct of its Agents, and would in other Respects act as good Faith &amp; Honour required. This Matter being disposed of, Mr. Canning said, that he had thought long &amp; anxiously upon what I had suggested to him at our late  
						Conferences, that the Subject had at first struck him as much more simple &amp; free of Difficulty than upon careful Examination it was found to be, that in the actual State of the World it behoved both him &amp; me to  
						move in this Affair with every possible Degree of Circumspection (an Intimation which he did not explain), but without some explicit Proposal on my Part in Writing, upon which the British Government could deliberate &amp; act,  
							nothing could be done, and, finally, that he must leave me to consult my own Discretion whether I would make such a Proposal. I answered, that, with such a previous Understanding between us as I had c

en afforded were required for Deliberation, why it was necessary  in the last Case  at all, or in the first Case, without being frankly apprized of the Effect it would produce. Mr. Canning replied that my Wish in this particular could not be acceded to, that if I presented a Note they  
							were left at perfect Liberty to decide upon what it proposed, that he could not give me even an Intimation of the probable Consequences of it, and in a Word that he would neither  
							invite nor discourage such a proceeding. He observed, too, that there were Points belonging to the Subject, which it was necessary to discuss in Writing, that my Suggestions implied that the  
						Embargo was produced by the British Orders in Council, that this could not be admitted, and that there were other questions necessarily incident to these  Measures, with the Examination of  
							which it was proper to begin upon an Occasion like the present. I remarked, in Answer, that with an actual Result in View, and with a Wish to arrive at that Result without  
						Delay, nothing could be worse imagined than to entangle ourselves in a written Correspondence, undefined as to its Scope &amp; Duration, upon Topics on which we were not likely to agree, that  
							if I were compelled to frame my Note with a Knowledge that it was only to provoke Argument, instead of leading at this momentous Crisis to a salutary change in the State of the  
						World, he must be aware that I too must argue, and that I could not justify it to my Government to abstain from a complete Assertion of all its fair pretensions &amp; a full Exposure of the true Character of those Acts, of which it  
						complained as illegal &amp; unjust  And where would this End? To what wholesome Object would it lead? My Remarks having no Effect, I made a farther slight attempt to ascertain the Reception which my Note would  
						meet with if I should determine to present one. This attempt failed; but I believed it to be quite apparent that, if any other Consequence than mere Discussion should follow the Receipt of my Note, it would be very slow  
						&amp; at a great Distance. At the Close of the Interview I observed, that as the Footing upon which this Interview had placed the Subject made Delay of no Importance, I should take Time to prepare such farther Proceeding as might appear to me to be required  
							by the Occasion.  
					I ought to mention that I give you in this Letter the Substance only of the Conversations which it states, and that there was nothing in any Degree unfriendly in the Language or

brought mea private letter from  
him with the following postcript  
of the Ist of July. “% An order  
has been reccived from Bayonne  
to condemn eight other of our  
ships.”  
  
On Friday the 22d of July, I  
had an interview with Mr. Can-  
ning, and renewed my efforts to  
obtain a revocation of the British  
orders of January and Novem-  
bor, 1807, and of the other or-  
ders dependent upon them. I  
have already informed you in my  
private letter of the 29th of June,  
that onthe morning of its date, I  
had a long conversation with Mr.  
Canning, which had rendered it  
somewhat probable that the ob-  
ject mentioned in your letter of  
the 30th of April (of which I  
had received a duplicate by the  
packet) would be accomplished,  
if.I should authorize the expec-  
tation which that letter suggests ;  
but that some days must elapse  
before I could speak with any  
thing like certainty on the sub-  
ject: and I have mentioned in  
another private letter (of the 10th  
of July) that it was understood  
between Mr. Canning and my-  
self, that another interview should  
take place soon after the proroga-  
tion of parliament. In effect,  
however, Mr. Canning was not  
prepared to see me again, until  
the 22d of July, after I had been  
recalled to London by the arrival  
of the St. Michael, and had, in  
consequence, reminded him of  
our arrangement by a private  
note.  
  
In the interview of the 29th of  
June, I soon found it necessary to  
throw out an intimation, that the  
_ power vested in the president by  
congress, to suspend the embargo  
  
&gt;  
  
act and its supplements, would  
be exercised as regarded Great  
Britain, if their orders were re-  
pealed, as regarded the United  
States. To have urged the revo-  
cation, upon the mere ground of  
strict right, or of general policy,  
and there to have left the subject,  
when I was authorized to place it  
upon grounds infinitely stronger,  
would have been, as it appeared  
to me, to stop short of my duty.  
Your letters to Mr. Erskine  
(which Mr. Canning has read and  
considered) had exhausted the  
first of these grounds, and end-  
less discussions here, in every  
variety of form, in and out of  
parliament, had ¢xhausted the  
second. ‘There was, besides, no  
objection of any force, to my  
availing myself, without delay  
of the powerful inducements,  
which the intimation in question  
was likely to furnish to Great  
Britain, to abandon her late sys-  
tem; and it seemed to be cer-  
tain that, by delaying to present  
these inducements to Mr. Can-  
ning’s consideration, I should nut  
only lose muci time, but finaily  
give to my conduct a disingenu-  
ous air, which, while it must be  
foreign to the views and senti-  
ments of the president, could  
hardly fail to make a very unfa-  
vorable impression upon the  
minds of Mr. Canning and his  
colleagues. I thought, more-  
over, that if I should reserve the  
suggestion for a late stage of our  
discussions, it would be made to  
wear the appearance of a gonces-  
sion reluctantly extorted, rather  
than of what it was, the sponta-  
neous result of the characteristic  
frankness and honorable policy of  
our government.  
  
The intimation once made, a

complete developement of its  
natural consequences, if proper-  
Jy acted upon, followed of course ;  
and taking advantage of the lati-  
tude afforded by the informal na-  
ture of a mere conversation, I  
endeavored to make that deve-  
lopement as strong an appeal as,  
consistently with truth and honor,  
I could (and there was no neces-  
sity to do more) to the justice and  
  
the prudence of this govern-  
  
ment.  
  
It was not possible, however,  
that Mr. Canning could require  
to be assisted by my explana-  
tions. It was plain, upon their  
own principles, that they could  
not equitably persevere in their  
erders in council, upon the foun-  
dation of an imputed acquies-  
cence, on our part, in French in-  
vasions of our neutral rights,  
when it was become (if it was not  
always) apparent, that this impu-  
tation was completely and in all  
respects an error; when it was  
manifest that these orders, by let-  
ting loose upon our rights a more  
destructive and offensive perse-  
cution than it was in the power  
of France to maintain, interposed  
between us and France, furnished  
answers to our remonstrances  
against her decrees and pretexts  
for those decrees, and stood in  
the way of that very resistance  
which Great Britain affected to  
inculcate, as aduty, at the mo-  
ment when she was taking the  
most effectual measures to em-  
barrass and confound it; and  
when it was also manifest, that a  
revocation of those orders would,  
if not attended or followed bya  
revocation of the decrees of  
  
France, place us at issue with  
  
that power, and result in a pre-  
cise opposition, by the United  
States, to such parts of her anti-  
commercial edicts as it became  
us to repel.  
  
In a prudential view my expla-  
nations seemed still less to be re-  
quired. Nothing could be more  
clear than that, if Great Britain  
revoked her orders, and entitled  
herself to a suspension of the  
embargo, her object (if it were  
any thing short of the establish-  
ment and practical support of an  
exclusive dominion over the seas)  
must, in some mode or other, be  
accomplished, whether France  
followed her example, or not. In  
the first case, the avowed purpose  
of the British orders would be  
fulfilled, and commerce would  
resume its accustomed prosperity  
and expansion. In the last, the  
just resistance of the U. States  
(more efficacious than that of the  
British orders) to French irregu-  
laritics and aggressions, would be  
left to its fair operation (and it  
was impossible to mistake the  
consequences), while the com-  
mercial intercourse between the  
United States ana Great Britain,  
being revived, would open the  
way for a return to good under-  
standing, and, in the end, for an  
adjustment of all their differ-  
ences.  
  
On the 29th of July I met Mr.  
Canning again, and was soon ap-  
prised that our discussions, if con-  
tinued at all, must take a new  
form.

“ In il&gt;‘ n&gt;ervv\.v ol the Jjyth ot June, I soon

to have left the subject, when l whs ant’ omsc* to  
place it upon grounds inlinit ly strong r, wo .  
have been, as it . ppeared to no, to stiv short of  
my duty. Youi U tters to Mr. Krskina (which Mr.  
Canning has read and consider*.!) Imd exhausted the  
flrst ot these grounds, and endless discussions here.  
In everv variety of form, ia and out of parliament,  
had exhausted ih-gecond There w is, besides, no  
objection of any force, to my availing myself, tfith  
ou&#x27;delay, of lb* powerful inducements, whirh th*  
intimation in question, was likely to fnrntsli to  
Great Britain, to ahandoBber lute system; and it  
seeiv.cn to be certain that, by delaying to present  
th. se .nduceineots to Mr. Caft&#x27;iing’s consideration,  
I should not only lose much time, Imt finally give  
to my conduct a disingenuous a if, which, while it  
must !«e foreign to the views and sentiments of thy  
president,**&#x27;,»&#x27;!d hardly fail to make a very unfavor­  
al l impression upon the mind, m Mr. Cunning and  
his colleagues. I thought, moreover, that it I  
should reserve the suggestion for a late slag* of our  
discussions, it would be mad. &gt;« wear the appear­  
ance of a concession reh&#x27;-tuniiy extortsd, rutlter  
than of what it whs, the spout menus result of the  
rlmruc t&lt; rislirk frankness huU t.onoiable polby uf  
our ^overrun Hit.  
The iminiKt on once made, &lt; complete drvclope­  
ni-nt of its natural consequents, it properly acted  
upon, followed of course; anri luting advantage ol  
the latitude aflbrdgtl by tin- u. «rui ,1 nature of a  
mere conversation, I endeavored to make tout dev­  
elopcment as strong an appeal as, consistently with  
troll. hhI honour, I coolu (and there was no neres­  
s • 10 d &gt; rnoie) to the justice and the prudence of  
this government.  
&quot;li was nut possible, however, that Mr. Canning  
could require to he assisted by my explanations. It  
was pUiu, upuu their own principles, (hat they could  
  
not equitably persevere in their orders in cnun. il,  
upon the foundation of an imputed acquiescence, oil  
our pari, in Frencii invasions ol our neutral right*,  
when it was become (if it was not always) apparent  
llial tins imputation was completely and in all res­  
pects an error; when it was manifest that these or­  
ders, by b iting loii&gt;,&quot; op,i,, our rights a more des­  
tructive mil oliinsiv persecution than it was in the  
power ot France to rriafnt. it\, interposed between us  
and I&#x27;ranre, furnished auswers to our mmnnstram eg  
against her decrees and pietexts for those du rets,  
and stood in the way of that very resistance which  
Great-Britain aliecl-d to ili olcale, as a duty, at the  
moment when t..e was liking the most eri r ual  
measures to embarrass and confound il; and when it  
w as also manifest, that a rev oration of those ordt rs  
would, ii not altindtd or followed by a revocation o&#x27;  
the decrees ot France, place us at issue with t! it  
power, and result ai a precise opposition, try the L •  
mted Stales, to such parts of her anti-commercial  
edicts as it became us to reptl.  
In a prudential view my explanations seemed still  
less to he required. Nothing could be more clear  
than that, it Great-Britam revoked her orders, and  
entitle ! hersell to a susp1 nsion of the embargo, her  
object (if it were any tiling short of the rglubhs? -  
mi nt and pr;u t a I support ul an exclusi ve dominion  
over the sets) must, in some mode nr other, be .if­  
&lt; omplishcd, whether Frame follow her exrmpie or  
not. in the first case, the avowed purpose of the  
British orders would be fulfilleo, and commerce  
would resume its accustomed prosperity and exp in­  
stotr. in the last, lire just resistance of the United  
States (mure efficacious than that of the British or  
tiers) to French irregularities and aggressions, would  
t e left to its fair operation, (mid it was impns i&lt; l  
to mistake the consequences) while the commerced  
intercourse between the United States and Great­  
Britiin. being revived, would open the way to a re­  
turn to a good understanding, and, ,n the end, lor an  
adjustment ol all their differences.”  
“ On the 29th of July, I met Mr. Canning again,  
and w; s soon apprized that our discussions, if conti­  
nued at all, must take a new form.”  
“ As there is now no reason for detaining the St.

“The St. Michael arrived at Falmouth on  
I&#x27;hursday the 14th of last month, alter a i  
•assure of eight days from L’Orient. Cap  
ain Kenyon delivered to me, on Wednesday i  
he 20rti, (upon my arrival in town fio/n  
Brighton, win-re 1 bad been for a short time, i  
•n account of my health) your letters &lt; the &lt;  
*OtH of April, and your private lcttc*- of the  
  
1 st of May together with newspnpers, printed  
copies of the embargo act and its supplements,  
and of papers laid before Congress at their  
last-session. Mr. Hall brought me a letter  
from General Armstrong, of the 26th of June,  
(of which I scud an extract) and Mr. Upson  
brought me a private letter from him, with  
the following postscript of the first o( July—  
“ An order has been received from Bayonne,  
to condemn eight ctlicr of our ships.”  
On Friday the 22d of July, Iliad an inter­  
view with Mr. Canning, and renewed my ef­  
forts to obtain a revocation of the British or­  
ders of January and November, lfcor, and of  
the other order* dependent upon them. I I  
have already informed you, in mv private  
letter of the 29th of June, that on the mor­  
ning of its date, I had a long conversation  
with Mr. Canning, which had rendered it  
somewhat probable that the object mentioned  
in your letter of the 30th of April (of which  
Iliad received a duplicate by the packet)  
would be accomplished, if I should authorise  
the expectation which that letter suggests;  
but that same days miist elapse before I could  
speak with any thing like certainty ou the  
Subject; and I have mentioned in another  
private letter (of the 10th of July) that it was  
understood between Mr. Corning at d myself  
that another interview should take place  
soon after the prorogation of parliament. In  
eflvct, however, M*\ Canning was no’ pre­  
pared to see me again until the .2d of July,  
after I had been &#x27;recalled to Lm .on bv the  
arrival of the St. Michael, and h:ul in conse­  
quence, reminded him of our arrangement by  
a private note.  
  
In the interview of the 2?thof June, I soon  
found it fiecfssavy to throw out an intima­  
tion. that the power vested in the President,  
by Congress, to sr. - iend the embargo act and  
; its supplements, would be exercised, as re­  
i gartled Great-Britftin. if their orders were  
j repealed, as regarded the United States.

| ground of strict right, or of general policy,  
!•&gt;•.,) .1....... &gt;....— i„r. .1,. _i.&#x27; .„.i. • ,  
&#x27; was authorized to place it upon grounds in­  
. finitely stronger, would have been, as it ap­  
peared to me. to stop short of my duty. Your  
i letters to Mr. Frskinc, (which Air. Can­  
ning has read and considered,) had exhaust­  
ed the first of these grounds, and endlers  
discussions here, in every variety of form,  
in and out of Parliament, had exhausted the  
second. Tltero was, besides, no objection,  
of any force, to my availing myself, without  
dCIay, of the powerful inducements, which  
[the intimation in question was likely to fur­  
jnish to (Ireat-Britain, to abandon her late  
[system ; and it seemed to he certain that,  
bv delaying to present these inducements to  
] Mr. Canning’s consideration, I should not  
[only lose much time, but finally give to my  
| conduct a disingenuous air, which, while it  
must be foreign to the views and sentiments  
of the President, could hardly fail to make a  
very unfavorable impression on the minds of  
j Mr. Canning and his colleagues. I thought,  
! moreover, that, if I should reserve the sug­  
j gestion for a late staple of our discussions, it  
would be made to wear the appearance of  
a conce«sion reluctantly extorted, rather  
than what it was, the spontaneous result of  
the characteristic frankness And honorable  
policy of our government.  
The intimation once made, a complet** de­  
vclopement of its natural consequences, if  
properly acted upon, followed of course :  
j and, taking advantage of the latitude, af­  
&#x27; fowled by the informal nature of a mere Con­  
j versution, I endeavored to make that devel­  
j opement as strong an appeal as, consistently  
with truth and honor, i could, (and there was  
no necessity to do more) to the justice and  
the prudence of this government.  
It was net possible, however, that Mr.  
Canning could require to he assisted by my  
explanations. It was plain, upon their own  
principles, that they could net equitably per­  
severe in their orders in council, upon the  
foundation of an imputed acquiescence on  
our part in French invasions of our neutral  
rights, when it was become, (if it was not  
always,) apparent, that this imputation was  
completely, and in all respects, an error;  
when it was manifest that these orders, by  
letting loose upon our rights a more destruc­  
tive and offensive persecution than it was in  
the power of France to maintain, interpo­  
sed between us and France, furnished an­  
swers to our remonstrances against her de­  
&#x27; crees and pretexts for those decrees, and  
stood in the way of that very resistance which  
Great-Britain affected to inculcate as a duty,  
at the moment when she was taking the  
most effectual measures to embarrass and  
cenfojnd it ; and when it was also manifest  
that a revocation of those orders would, if  
not attended or followed by a revocation of  
I the decrees of France, place us at issue with  
that power, and result in a precise opposite  
! on by the United States to suefc parts of her  
anti-commercial edicts as it became us to  
repel.  
In a prudential view, my explanations  
seemed still less to be required. Nothing  
could be more clear than that, if Cireat­  
Britain revoked her orders, and entitled  
herself to a suspension of the embargo, her  
object, (if it were any thing short of tiie es­  
tablishment and practical support of an ex­  
clusive dominion over the seas) must, in  
some mode or other, be accomplished, whe­  
ther France followed her example or not.  
In the first case, the avowed purpose of the  
British orders would be fulfilled, and com­  
merce would resume its accustomed prospe­  
rity and expansion. In the last, the just re­  
sistance of the United States, (more effica­  
cious than that of the Briti .li 01 rs,) to  
French irregularities and aggressions would  
be left to its fair operation, (and it was im­  
possible to mistake the consequences,) while  
the commercial intercourse between the La­  
nded Stales and Grcat-Britain bring revived,  
would open the way for a return to good un­  
derstanding, aflu, in the end, for an adjust  
ment of all their differences.”  
“ On the 20lh of July, I met Mr. Canning  
again, and was soon apprized that our dis­  
cussions, if continued at all, must take anew  
form.”  
“As there is now no reason for detaining  
the St. Michael, she will be dispatched im­  
mediately for I/Oricnt.”

already informed you in my private  
letter of the 2Dtli ot June, tliat on the  
morning of its date, i had a long cm­  
j versation with Air Canning whicii had  
! rendered it somewhat probable that  
! the o iject mentioned in your letter ol  
the 30ili of April (of which 1 had re­  
ceived a duplicate by the packet) would  
be accomplished, if I should aut orize  
the expectation which that letter sug­  
gested ; but that some days must elapse  
bclorc I could speak with any thing  
like certainty on the subject: anti I have  
mentioned in another private letter(oi  
the 10th ol j uly) that it was understood  
■ between Air Canning and myself, that  
■ mother interview should take place  
i soon after the prorogation of pariia­

t ning was not prepared to sec me again,  
until the 22dof July, after I had been  
, recalled to London by the arrival ol  
• the St. Michael, and had, in conse­  
: quence reminded him of our arrange­  
  
inenc ny a private note.  
- *• In the interview of the 29th of June,  
i I soon fpund it necessary to throw out an  
intimation, that the power ves&#x27;ed in the

has read and considered) had exhaustet

of Uie other orders dependent upon them. X  
nave already Informed you &quot;in mv private

inr of Us d.ite, I had long conversation  
  
wnh Mr. - Canning, whkj had rendered it  
  
somewhat probnble that the object mentjoned  
  
in your letter ot the 50th of April (or which  
I bsd received a duplicate by the packet)  
  
would be accomplislied, if I should authorize.  
  
the exjiectation which that letter suggests ;  
but that some days niu.it elapse before I could

private letter (of the ldth of Jul?) that it waa  
understood between Mr. Cannmgand my­  
self, tht another interview sliould take place  
  
soon after the prorogatiotV of parliament  
  
In eficct, however, Mr. Canning? was not  
Irepaml&#x27;&#x27;to s me again, Wil the 22d of  
ulr, after I had been recalled to London by  
the&#x27; arrival of the St Mkhael,vsand had, in  
conwaence remised&#x27; him of our arrange­  
tuenl by a private ncfte. z &#x27;  
.In the interview of the ?9ili of. June, I  
soon found it necessary to throw outran inti­  
mation, that the power vested in the Resi­  
dent by Congress, to suspend the Embargo  
act and its supplements, would be exercised  
&#x27; at . regarded G reat-Britain, if their orders  
were repealed, as regarded the United States.  
To have urged the revocation, Upon the mere,  
ground of its strict right, or of general poli­  
cy, ami there to have left the subject, when  
t was authorized to place it: upon grounds  
infinitely stronger, would have been, as it  
appeared to roe, to stop short of my duty.­  
Vour Clctten to Mr, Enkine (which Mr.  
Canning has read andrconsidered) had ex  
hausted the .first of these grounds, and end  
less discussions here, in every variety &#x27; of  
form, in and out of parliament, had exhaus­  
ted the second. There was, besides, bo ob  
jection of any force, to my availing myself,  
without delay, of the powerful Inducements  
which the intimation in question, was likely to  
furmslMo Great-Britain, to abandon her late  
system and it seemed to be certain that, by  
delaying to present these inducements to Mr.  
Cnnning&#x27;a consideration, I should not only  
lose much time, but finally give to my coo­  
duct a disengenuous air, which, while it must  
be foreign o thhykws and sentirnents of the  
Prcsldent,&quot;could bardlyfaU to roake a very  
lirifAvbrable&quot; impression &quot;uponI&#x27;the&quot; mlndst of  
Mr. Canning and his colleagues.&quot; I thought,  
moreo ver, that if I should reserve the sug­  
gestion for a late stage of our discussions, it  
would be made to wear the appearance of  
a concession reluctantly extorted, &quot; rathe t  
than of. what jt was, the spoftUneous . result  
of the characterirtkrfrankne&amp;s and honora­  
ble policyof our government tt &#x27;Vr  
LThe intimation-oncer-made, a -complete  
dcvelopcmcnt of its natural consequences, if  
properly acted opon, followeiVofLcourlwU, an(l  
taklntr advantage of the latitdUe anorded by

and honor, I could (and there was no necen­  
sity to do more) .to the justice and the - pru­  
dence of this government y, 4  
It was not possible, howeveti that Mr.&#x27;  
Canning could, require to be assisted by my.  
explanations. It was plain,- upon their own  
principles, that they could not equitably per­  
severe in their orders in council, uponthe  
foundation of an imputed acquieacence, oa  
our part, in French invasions of our neutral  
rights,- when it was become Q( it waa not al­  
ways) . apparent that , this imputation was  
completely and in all respecta an error ; .  
when , it was manifest that these orders, &#x27; by  
  
Jetting Ioose unon our rights a more destruc  
  
tive and offcosive persecution than it was in  
the power of France to maintain, interposed 7  
  
between us and t ranee,, furnished answer  
to our, remonstrances against her decrees Jc  
pretexu for those decrees, and stood in the  
way of that very insistence which Great-  
Briuin affected to inculcate, as a duty, at  
  
the moment - when she -was taking the most  
efll-ctual measures to emtrarrass and confound  
  
k&#x27;iIrid&#x27; wlien&#x27;it&#x27;&quot;

; lu a prudential view my explanations seem--ed  
still less to be required. .Nothing could  
be more clear than that, if Great-Britain re- -;  
voted . her orders, and entitled herself to a j  
suspension of the Embargo, her object (if it  
were any thing short of the establishment &amp;

course was, that we should un-  
derstand one another as fo our  
respective views, and that a con-  
cise note, which I had in fact pre-  
pared since the last meeting,  
should then be presented and  
acted upon.—You informed me  
that my wish in this particular,  
could not be acceded to; that, if  
I presented a note, you must be  
left at perfect liberty to decide  
upon what it proposed; that you  
could not give me even an inti-  
mation of the probable conse-  
quences of it; and, in a word,  
that you would neither invite nor  
discourage sucha proceeding. You  
added that there were some points,  
belonging to the subject, which  
it would be proper to discuss in  
writing; one of which was the  
connexion between our embargo  
and your orders of November,  
supposed ‘to be implied by m  
proposal. I remarked that, with  
an actual result in view, and with  
a wish to arrive at that result  
without delay, it could not be ad-  
viseable to entangle ourselves in  
a written correspondence, unde-  
fined as to its scope and duration,  
upon topics on which we were  
not likely to agree ; and that, if I  
were to frame my note, with a  
knowledge that it was to provoke  
argument, instead of leading at  
this crisis to a salutary change in  
  
the state of the world, you must  
be conscious that I too must  
argue. And where would this  
end? Towhat wholesome conse-  
quence would it conduct us? At  
the close of the interview I ob-  
served that, as the footing, upon  
which the subject was now placed,  
made delay of no importance, I  
should take time to prepare such  
farther proceeding as the occa-  
sion required.  
  
On the 26th of August I had  
the honour to see you again, and,  
after entering more at large, than  
I had before believed to be pro-  
per, into a consideration of the  
effect of my proposal on the equi-
