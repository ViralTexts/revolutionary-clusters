That this remaining task may be executed under impressions conducive to a just and fair result, some reflections must in this place be indulged, which candour previously suggests. It is a misfortune, inseparable from human affairs, that public measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation which is essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to advance or obstruct the public good; and that this spirit is more apt to be diminished than promoted, by those occasions which require an unusual exercise of it. To those who have been led by experience to attend to this consideration, it

 discussion and accurate judgment of its merits. In some, it has been too evident from their own publications, that they have scanned the proposed constitution, not only with a predisposition to censure; but with a predetermination to condemn: As the language held by others betrays an opposite predetermination or bias, which must render their opinions also of little moment in the question. In placing however, these different characters on a level, with respect to the weight of their opinions, I wish not to insinuate that there may not be a material difference in the purity of their intentions.

e existing confederation is founded on principles which are fallacious; that we must consequently change this first foundation, and with it, the superstructure resting upon it. It has been shewn, that the other confederacies which could be consulted as precedents, have been viciated by the same erroneous principles, and can therefore furnish no other light than that of beacons, which give warning of the course to be shunned, without pointing out that which ought to be pursued. The most that the convention could do in such a situation, was to avoid the errors suggested by the past experience of other countries, as well as of our own; and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors, as future experience may unfold them.  
Among the difficulties encountered by the convention, a very important one must have lain, in combining the requisite stability and energy in government with the inviolable attention due to liberty, and to the republican form. Without substantially accomplishing this part of their undertaking, they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of their appointment, or the expectation of the public: Yet, that it could not be easily accomplished, will be denied by no one, who is unwilling to betray his ignorance of the subject. Energy in government is essential to that security against external and internal danger, and to that prompt and salutary execution of the laws, which enter into the very definition of good government. Stability in government, is essential to national character, and to the advantages annexed to it, as well as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people, which are among the chief blessings of civil society. An irregular and mutable legislation is not more an evil in itself, than it is odious to the people; and it may be pronounced with assurance, that the people of this country, enlightened as they are, with regard to the nature, and interested, as the great body of them are, in the effects of goo

The genius of republican liberty, seems to demand on one side, not only, that all power should be derived from the people; but, that those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people, by a short duration of their appointments; and, that, even during this short period, the trust should be placed not in a few, but in a number of hands

ble of the contrary influence which must have been experienced in the task of forming it.  
Would it be wonderful if under the pressure of all these difficulties, the convention should have been forced into some deviations from that artificial structure and regular symmetry, which an abstract view of the subject might lead an ingenious theorist to bestow on a constitution planned in his closet or in his imagination? The real wonder is, that so many difficulties should have been surmounted; and surmounted with an unanimity almost as unprecedented as it must have been unexpected. It is impossible for any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance, without partaking of the astonishment. It is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it, a finger of that Almighty Hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution. We had occasion in a former paper, to take notice of the repeated trials which have been unsuccessfully made in the United Netherlands, for reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their constitution. The history of almost all the great councils and consultations, held among mankind for reconciling their discordant opinions, assuaging their mutual jealousies, and adjusting their respective interests, is a history of factions, contentions and disappointments; and may be classed among the most dark and degrading pictures which display the infirmities and depravities of the human character. If, in a few scattered instances, a brighter aspect is presented, they serve only as exceptions to admonish us of the general truth; and by their lustre to darken the gloom of the adverse prospect to which they are contrasted. In revolving the causes from which these exceptions result, and applying them to the particular instance before us, we are necessarily led to two important conclusions. The first is, that the convention must have enjoyed in a very singular degree, an exemption from the pestilential influence of party animosities; the diseases most incident to deliberative bodies, and most apt to contaminate their proceedings. The second conclusion is, that all the deputations composing the convention, were either satisfactorily accommodated by the final act; or were induced to accede to it, by a deep conviction of the necessity of sacrificing private opinions and partial interests, to the public good, and by a despair of seeing this necessity diminished by delays or by new experiments.

They love genius and talent, and are ever willing,  
dazzled by their influence, to surrender their entire  
confidence to their sway ; and yet that genius and  
that talent are but too often employed in leading the  
masses, sheep-like, to their own destruction. Mr.  
Madison most truly observes, 44 that it is a misfor­  
4 tune inseparable from human affairs that public  
4 measures are rarely investigated with that spirit  
4 of moderation which is essential to a just estimate  
4 of their real tendency to advance or obstruct the  
4 public good ; and that this spirit is more apt to  
i be diminished than promoted by those occasions

by its labors. Hence, while this ceased to disturb the  
Union, the others continued to rage and to distract its  
counsels. They were, indeed, among the great elements  
of discord, by which the angry passions of men were  
kindled into the flames of the late war.  
  
In regard to the first problem above mentioned, Mr.  
Madison says in The Federalist: ‘Among the difficulties  
encountered by the Convention, a very important one must  
have lain in considering the requisite stability and energy  
in government, with the inviolable attention due to the  
republican form. Without substantially accomplishing  
this part of their undertaking, they would have very imper-  
fectly fulfilled the object of their appointment, or the ex-  
pectations of the public; yet that it could not be easily ac-  
complished, will be denied by no one who is unwilling to  
betray his ignorance of the subject.’......... ‘The genius  
of republican liberty,’ he continues, ‘seems to demand  
on one side, not only that all power should be derived  
from the people, but that those entrusted with it should  
be kept in dependence on the people, by a short dura-  
tion of their appointment.’* How, then, shall thes

_No. For ‘it has been shown,’ says Mr. Madison, ‘that the  
other Confederacies which could be consulted as precedents

therefore, furnish no other light than that of beacons, which  
give warning of the course to be shunned, without pointing out

But does not the wisdom of past ages, even in regard to  
Confederacies, furnish some little light to guide, as well as to  
warn? Does not the history of past ages, or ‘philosophy teach-
