,  
[Middlebrook, 31 May 1779]  
  
The expedition you are appointed to command is to be directed against the hostile tribes of the six nations of Indians, with their associates and adherents. The immediate objects are the total destruction and devastation of their settlements and the capture of as many prisoners of every age and sex as possible. It will be essential to ruin their crops now in the ground and prevent their planting more.  
The troops to be employed under your commmand are—Clintons, Maxwells, Poors and Hands Brigades and ten independent companies raised in the State of Pennsylvania—In Hands Brigade, I comprehend all the detached corps of Continental troops now on the Susquehanna and Spencers regiment—Cortlandts I consider as belonging to Clintons Brigade—Aldens may go to Poors &amp; Butlers &amp; the rifle corps to Maxwells or Hands according to their comparative strength and circumstances.  
Clintons Brigade you are informed has been ordered to rendezvous at Conojoharie, subject to your orders either to form a junction with the main body on the Susquehannah, by way of Otsege—or to proceed up the Mohawk river and co-operate in the best manner circumstances will permit—as you judge most adviseable.  
So soon as your preparations are in sufficient forwardness, you will assemble your main body at Wyoming and proceed thence to Tioga, taking from that place the most direct and practicable route into the heart of the Indian settlements—You will establish such intermediate posts as you think necessary for the security of your communication and convoys, nor need I caution you, while you leave a sufficiency of men for their defence to take care to diminish your operating force as little as possible. A post at Tioga will be particularly necessary—either a stockade Fort or an intrenched camp—if the latter a blockhouse should be erected in the interior.  
I would recommend that some post in the center of the Indian Country should be occupied with all expedition, with a sufficient quantity of provision, whence parties should be detached to lay waste all the settlements around with instructions to do it in the most effectual manner, that the country may not be merely overrun but destroyed.  
I beg leave to suggest as general rules that ought to govern your operations—to make rather than receive attacks, attended with as much impetuosity, shouting and noise as possible, and to make the troops act in as loose and dispersed a way as is consistent with a proper degree of government concert and mutual support—It should be previously impressed upon the minds of the men wherever they have an opportunity, to rush on with the war hoop and fixed bayonet—Nothing will disconcert and terrify the Indians more than this.  
I need not urge the necessity of using every method in your power, to gain intelligence of the enemy’s strength motions and designs; nor need I suggest the extraordinary degree of vigilance and caution which will be necessary to guard against surprises from an adversary so secret desultory &amp; rapid as the Indians.  
If a detachment operates on the Mohawk River the commanding Officer should be instructed to be very watchfull that no troops come from Oswegatchie and Niagara to Oswego without his knowledge; and for this purpose he should keep trusty spies at those three places to advertise him instantly of the movement of any party and its force. This detachment should also endeavour to keep up a constant intercourse with the main body.  
More than common care will be necessary of your arms and ammunition from the nature of the service—They should be particularly inspected after a rain or the passage of any deep water.  
After you have very thoroughly completed the destruction of their settlements; if the Indians should show a disposition for peace, I would have you to encourage it, on condition that they will give some decisive evidence of their sincerity by delivering up some of the principal instigators of their past hostility into our hands—Butler, Brandt, the most mischievous of the tories that have joined them or any other they may have in their power that we are interested to get into ours—They may possibly be engaged, by address, secrecy and stratagem, to surprise the Garrison of Niagara and the shipping on the lakes and put them into our possession. This may be demanded as a condition of our friendship and would be a most important point gained—If they can render a service of this kind you may stipulate to assist them in their distress with supplies of provisions and other articles of which they will stand in need, having regard in the expectations you give them to our real abilities to perform. I have no power at present to authorise you to conclude a treaty of peace with them but you may agree upon the terms of one, letting them know that it must be finally ratified by Congress and giving them every proper assurance that it will. I shall write to Congress on the subject and endeavour to obtain more ample and definitive authority.  
But you will not by any means listen to ⟨any⟩ overture of peace before the total ruin of their settlements is effected—It is likely enough their fears if they are unable to oppose us, will compel them to offers of peace, or policy may lead them, to endeavour to amuse us in this way to gain time and succour for more effectual opposition. Our future security will be in their inability to injure us the distance to which they are driven and in the terror with which the severity of the chastisement they receive will inspire ⟨them.⟩ Peace without this would be fallacious and temporary—New presents and an addition of force from the enemy would engage them to break it the first fair opportunity and all the expence of our extensive preparations would be lost.  
When we have effectually chastised them we may then listen to peace and endeavour to draw further advantages from their fears. But even in this case great caution will be necessary to guard against the snares which their treachery may hold out—They must be explicit in their promises give substantial pledges for their performance and execute their engagements with decision and dispatch. Hostages are the only kind of security to be depended on.  
Should Niagara fall into your hands in the manner I have mentioned—you will do every thing in your power for preserving &amp; maintaining it, by establishing a chain of posts, in such manner as shall appear to you most safe and effectual and tending as little to reduce our general force as possible—Th⟨is⟩ however we shall be better able to decide as the future events of the campaign unfold themselves—I shall be more explicit on the subject hereafter.  
  
When you have completed the objects of your expedition, unless otherwise directed in the mean time, you will return to form a junction with the main army by the most convenient expeditious and secure route according to circumstances—The Mohawk river, if it can be done without too great risk, will perhaps be most elegible on several accounts. Much should depend on the relative position of the main army at the time.  
As it is impossible to foresee what may be the exigences of the service in this quarter, this united with other important reasons make⟨s⟩ it essential that your operations should be as rapid and that the expedition should be perform⟨ed in as little t⟩ime as will be consistent with ⟨its success and e⟩fficacy.  
And here I cannot forbear repeating my former caution, that your troops may move as light and as little encumbered as possible even from their first outset—The state of our Magazines demands it as well as other considerations—if much time should be lost in transporting the troops and stores up the river—the provisions for the expedition will be consumed and the general scantiness of our supplies will not permit their being replaced—conse⟨quently⟩ the whole enterprise may be defeated—I would recommend it to you for this purpose that the General Officers should make an actual inspection of the baggage of their several Brigades and absolutely reject to be left behind, at proper places every articles that can be dispensed with on the expedition—This is an extraordinary case and requires extraordinary attention.  
Relying perfectly upon your judgment prudence and activity—I have the highest expectation of success equal to our wishes; and I beg leave to assure you, that I anticipate with great pleasure, the honor which will redound to yourself and the advantage to the common cause, from a happy termination of this important enterprise.

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
The expedition you are appointed to command  
is to be directed against the hostile tribes of the  
six nations of Indians, with their associates and  
adherents. The immediate objects are the total  
destruction and devastation of their settlements  
and the capture of as many prisoners of every age  
and sex as possible. It will be essential to ruin  
their crops now in the ground and prevent their  
planting more.  
  
The troops to be employed under your com-  
mand are — Clinton’s, Poor’s, Maxwell’s and  
Hand’s Brigades and ten independent companies  
raised in the State of Pennsylvania—In Hand’s  
  
  
  
  
  
139  
  
Brigade, I comprehend all the detached corps of  
Continental troops now on the Susquehanna and  
Spencer’s regiment—Cortlandt’s I consider as be-  
longing to Clinton&#x27;s Brigade. Alden’s may go to  
Poor’s &amp; Butler’s &amp; the rifle corps to Maxwell’s or  
Hand’s according to their comparative strength  
and circumstances.  
  
Clinton’s Brigade you are informed has been  
ordered to rendezvous at Canojoharie, subject to  
your orders either to form a junction with the  
main body on the Susquehanna, by way of Otsege  
—or to proceed up the’ Mohawk river and coope-  
  
| rate in the best manner circumstances will permit  
  
—as you judge most adviseable.  
  
So soon as your preparations are in sufficient  
forwardness, you will assemble your main body  
at Wyoming and proceed thence to Tioga, taking  
from that place the most direct and practicable  
route into the heart of the Indian Settlements—  
You will establish such intermediate posts as you  
think necessary for the security of your communi-  
cation and convoys, nor need I caution you, while °  
you leave a sufficiency of men for their defence  
to take care to diminish your operating force as  
little as possible. A post at Tioga will be partic-  
ularly necessary—either a stockade fort or an  
intrenched camp—if the latter a block house  
should be erected in the interior.  
  
I would recommend that some post in the center  
of the Indian Country should be occupied with  
all expedition, with a sufficient quantity of pro-  
visions, whence parties should be detached to lay  
waste all the settlements around with instructions  
to do it in the most effectual manner; that the  
country may not be merely overrun but destroyed.  
  
I beg leave to suggest as general rules that  
ought to govern your operations—to make rather  
than receive attacks, attended with as much impet-  
uosity, shouting, and noise as possible, and to  
make the troops act in as loose and dispersed a  
way as is consistent with a proper degree of gov-  
ernment, concert, and mutual support—It should  
be previously impressed upon the minds of the  
men whenever they have an opportunity, to rush  
on with the war hoop and fixed bayonet—nothing  
will disconcert and terrify the Indians more than  
this.  
  
I need not urge the necessity of using every  
method in your power, to gain intelligence of the  
enemys strength motions and designs; nor need  
I suggest the extraordinary degrée of vigilance  
and caution which will be necessary to guard  
against suprises from an adversary so secret de-  
sultory and rapid as the Indians—  
  
If a detachment operates on the Mohawk River  
the commanding officer should be instructed to  
be very watchful that no troops come from Oswe-

instantly of the movement of any party and its  
force—This detachment should also endeavour to  
keep up a constant intercourse with the main  
body.  
  
More than common care will be necessary of  
your arms and ammunition from the nature of the  
service—They should be particularly inspected  
after a rain or the passage of any deep water.  
  
After you have very thoroughly completed the  
destruction of their settlements; if the Indians  
should show a disposition for peace, I would have  
you to negotiate on condition that they will give  
some decisive evidence of their sincerity by de-  
livering up some of the principle instigators of  
their.past hostility into our hands—Butler, Brandt,  
&amp; the most mischevious of the tories that have join-  
ed them or any other that may have in their power  
that we are interested to get into ours—  
  
They may possibly be engaged by address, se-  
crecy and stratagem, to surprise the Garrison of  
Niagara and the shipping on the lake and put  
them into our possession. This may be demanded  
as a condition of our friendship and would be a  
most important point gained—If they can render  
a service of this kind you may stipulate to assist  
them in their distress with supplies of provisions  
and other articles of which they will stand in  
need, having regard in the expectations you give  
them to our real abilities to perform. I have no  
power at present to authorize you to conclude a  
treaty of peace with them but you may agree  
  
upon the terms of one letting them know that it |  
  
must be finally ratified by Congress and giving  
them every proper assurance that it will be. I  
shall write to Congress on the subject and endeay-  
  
our to obtain moreample and definite authority. — |  
  
But you will not by any means listen to an  
  
overture of peace before the total ruin of their |  
  
settlements is effected—It is likely enough their  
fears if they are unable to oppose us, will compel  
them to offers of peace, or policy may lead them  
to endeavour to amuse us in this way to gain  
time and succour for more effectual opposition.  
Our future security will be in their inability to  
  
injure us the distance to which they are driven |  
  
and in the terror with which the severity of the  
chastisement they receive [T7wo or three words are  
obliterated.| Peace without this would be falla- |  
cious and temporary—New presents and an addi-  
tion of force from the enemy would engage them  
to break it the first fair opportunity and all the  
expense of our extensive preparations would be  
lost—  
  
When we have effectually chastised them we |  
  
may then listen to peace and endeavour to draw  
further advantages from their fears.  
this case great caution will be necessary to guard  
against the snares which their treachery may hold  
out. They must be explicit in their promises |  
give substantial pledges for their performance and

| execute their engagements with decision and dis-  
patch. Hostages are the only kind of security to  
be depended on.  
  
Should Niagara fall into your hands in the  
manner I have mentioned you will do everything  
in your power for preserving and maintaining it,  
by establishing a chain of posts, in such manner  
as shall appear to you most safe and effectual and  
tending as little to reduce our general force as  
possible—This however we shall be better able to  
decide as the future events of the campaign unfold  
themselves—I shall be more explicit on the subject  
hereafter.  
  
When you have completed the object of your  
expedition, unless otherwise directed in the mean-  
time, you will return to form a junction with the  
main army by the most convenient expeditious  
and secure route according to circumstances—The  
Mohawk river if it can be done without too much  
risk, will be most eligible on several accounts.  
Much should depend on the relative position of  
the main army at the time.  
  
As it is impossible to forsee what may be the  
exigences of the service in this quarter, this united  
with other important reasons make it essential  
that your operations should be rapid and that the  
expedition should be performed in as little time  
as will be consistent with its success and efficacy —  
  
And here I cannot forbear repeating my former  
caution, that your troops may moove as light  
and as little encumbered as possible even from  
their first out set. The state of our Magazines de-  
mands it as well as other considerations—if much  
time should be lost in transporting the troops and  
stores up the rivers the provisions for the expedi-  
tion will be consumed and the general scantiness  
| of our supplies will not permit of their being re-  
  
placed—consequently the whole enterprise may  
  
be defeated. I would recommend it to you for  
  
this purpose that the General officers should make  
  
an actual inspection of the baggage of their seve-  
  
ral Brigades and absolutely reject to be left be-  
| hind, at proper places every article that can be  
| dispensed with on the expedition—This is an ex-  
traordinary case and requires extraordinary atten-  
tion—  
  
Relying so perfectly upon your judgement pru-  
dence and activity—I have the highest expecta-  
tion of success equal to our wishes; and I beg  
| leave to assure you, that I anticipate with great  
  
pleasure, the honor which will redound to your-  
self and the advantage to the common cause, from  
| a happy termination of this important enterprise.

mise. The true character of the Indian atro-  
cities may be fairly judged from the nature of  
these instructions, and it should be borne in  
mind that these were issued soon after the re-  
ports of the Wyoming and Cherry Valley mas-  
sacres had been received at headquarters.  
  
Immediately on the receipt of his orders,  
which were dated on the 3lst of May, 1779,  
General Sullivan began the organization of  
the expedition. The troops to be employed  
were the brigades of Clinton, Maxwell, Poor,  
and Hand, reénforced by certain independent  
companies raised in the State of Pennsylva-  
nia. As these latter companies failed to re-  
port, their place was filled at a later day by
