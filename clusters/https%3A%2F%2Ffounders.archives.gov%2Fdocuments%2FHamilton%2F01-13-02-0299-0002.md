Sir,  
  
I have lost no time in preparing, as far as has been practicable, consistently with the course of facts, the several statements required by the resolutions of the House of Representatives, of the 23d. of last month, and I have concluded to add to them such further statements, as appeared to me necessary to convey fully the information, which is understood to be the object of those resolutions. It was my first intention to submit these statements collectively, with such explanatory remarks, as the occasion might demand, but finding, on experiment, from the extent and variety of the matter, involved in the resolutions, that more time will be requisite for a full developement of it, than I had anticipated, considerations of weight in my mind have determined me to present the different parts of the subject successively. Among other advantages, incident to this course of proceeding, will be that of having it in my power to give a more accurate and mature view of the entire subject, without too great a dereliction of current business of the department. In executing the task I propose to myself, I shall rely on the indulgence of the House, to a latitude of observation, corresponding with the peculiar circumstances of the case.  
The resolutions, to which I am to answer, were not moved without a pretty copious display of the reasons, on which they were founded. These reasons are before the public through the channel of the press. They are of a nature, to excite attention, to beget alarm, to inspire doubts. Deductions of a very extraordinary complexion may, without forcing the sense, be drawn from them.  
I feel it incumbent on me to meet the suggestions, which have been thrown out, with decision and explicitness. And, while I hope, I shall let fall nothing inconsistent with that cordial and unqualified respect, which I feel for the House of Representatives, while I acquiesce in the sufficiency of the motives, that induced, on their part, the giving a prompt and free course to the investigation proposed—I cannot but resolve to treat the subject, with a freedom, which is due to truth, and to the consciousness of a pure zeal for the public interest.  
I begin with the last of the four resolutions; because it is that, which seeks information, relating to the most delicate and important of the suggestions, that have been hazarded.  
Here, however, I have to regret the utter impossibility of a strict compliance with the terms of the resolution. The practicability of such a compliance would suppose nothing less than that, since the last day of December 1792, all the accounts of the Collectors of the Customs, and other Officers of the revenue, throughout the whole extent of the United States, could be digested, made up, and forwarded to the Treasury, could be examined there, settled and carried into the public books, under their proper heads. In a word, that all the revenues, receipts and expenditures of this extensive country could have passed through a complete exhibition, examination, and adjustment, within the short period of twenty three days.  
It was made, (as I presume, from the result) satisfactorily to appear to a Committee of the House of Representatives, who were charged, during the last session, with framing a direction to the treasury for bringing forward an annual account of receipts and expenditures, that the course of public business would not admit of the rendering of such an account, in less than nine months after the expiration of each year; in conformity to which idea, their report was formed, and an Order of the House established.  
  
I need do nothing more, to evince the impracticability of an exact compliance with the resolution in question, than to observe that it is even more comprehensive, though with less detail, than the order of the House, to which I have alluded.  
To evince, nevertheless, my readiness to do all in my power, towards fulfilling the views of the House, and throwing light upon the transactions of the department, I shall now offer to their inspection sundry Statements, marked A, B, C, D, E, F, which contain, as far as is, at this time, possible, the information desired, and with sufficient certainty and accuracy, to afford satisfaction on the points of inquiry involved in the resolution.  
The Statement A, shews, in abstract, the whole of the receipts into, and expenditures from the Treasury, commencing with the first of January, and ending with the last day of December 1792, corresponding with the accounts of the Treasurer. These accounts have been regularly settled up to the end of September, and copies have been laid before the two Houses of Congress. The account for the quarter terminating with the year has not yet passed through the forms of settlement but it is under examination, and will, no doubt, be settled as it stands, the manner of conducting the business, and the usual care and accuracy of the officer concerned, leaving very little room to apprehend mis-statement or error. A copy of this account is herewith submitted in the Schedule, marked, C.  
This Statement takes up the balance of the general account of receipts and expenditures, to the end of the year 1791, as reported to the House of Representatives, within the first week of the present Session, and continuing it down to the end of the year 1792, shews a balance then in the treasury, of seven hundred and eighty three thousand, four hundred and forty four dollars and fifty one cents.  
The Statement, B, is a more comprehensive document. It is a general account of Income and Expenditure. It shews, not merely, the actual receipts of money into the Treasury, but the whole amount of the national revenues, from the commencement of the present government to the conclusion of the year 1792, as well outstanding, as collected—the proceeds of the domestic loans—the whole amount of the sums which have been drawn into the United States, on account of the foreign loans—and all other monies, for whatever source, which have accrued within the period embraced by the Statement.  
Those items form the debit-side of the account, amounting to seventeen millions eight hundred and seventy nine thousand, eight hundred and twenty five dollars and thirty three cents.  
The Credit-side consists of two items. 1st. The whole amount of the actual expenditures, to the end of the year 1791, as stated in the general account of receipts and expenditures before referred to. 2nd. The whole amount of the actual expenditures during the year 1792, as specified generally in the Statement A, and particularly in the several quarterly accounts of the Treasurer, amounting to twelve millions seven hundred and sixty five thousand one hundred and twenty eight dollars and eighty three cents.  
The balance of this account of income and expenditure is consequently five millions one hundred and fourteen thousand six hundred and ninety six dollars and fifty cents; which corresponds with the excess of the public income (including the proceeds of loans, foreign and domestic) beyond the actual expenditure, or, more properly speaking, disbursement, to the end of the year 1792. This of course, is exclusive of those parts of the proceeds of foreign loans, which have been left in Europe, to be applied there; the amount, application and balance of which are exhibited, as far as they are yet known in the treasury, in the Statement, No. I, of my late report on foreign loans.  
This balance, as noted in the Statement, B, is composed of the following particulars:  
  
  
1st.  
Cash in the treasury, per Statement A Dollars  
783.444.51  
  
  
2d.  
Cash in the Bank of the United States, and the offices of discount and deposit of New York and Baltimore, not yet passed to the credit of the Treasurer, per Statement AB  
605.883. 8.  
  
  
  
3d.  
Proceeds of Amsterdam Bills remaining in deposit, in the Bank of North America, including the sum of one hundred and fifty six thousand five hundred and ninety five dollars and fifty six cents, advanced by the Bank without interest, which is credited in the general Account of receipts and expenditures, Statement A  
177.998.80.  
  
  
4th.  
Proceeds of Amsterdam sold, but not yet received  
614.593. 2  
  
  
5th.  
Cash in hands of Collectors of customs, per Abstract D  
151.851.25.  
  
  
6th.  
Bonds unpaid at the end of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two, on account of the duties on imports and tonnage, and falling due between that time and May one thousand seven hundred and ninety four, per Abstract E  
2.442.069.15.  
  
  
7th.  
Uncollected residue of duties on Spirits distilled within the United States, per Abstract F  
341.057.19.  
  
  
  
   Making together Dollars  
5.116.897.    
  
  
This aggregate somewhat exceeds the balance of the account; but in a case where estimates must necessarily supply the deficiency of ascertained results, differences of this nature are of course. It is, at the same time, satisfactory to observe, that the estimates, which have been heretofore communicated, are proved by the official documents, already received, to have been essentially correct.  
It will, no doubt, readily occur to the House, that a very small part of the excess, which has been stated, is a real surplus of income. There remain to be satisfied numerous objects of expenditure, charged upon the fund by the appropriations, which have been made, that cannot fail ultimately to exhaust it, probably within four or five hundred thousand dollars; which will be embraced in the appropriations for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety three. A further explanation on this point is reserved for future communication.  
A due comprehension of the Statements now presented must obviate every idea of a balance unaccounted for, in whatever sense the allegation may have been intended to be made.  
If there was before any obscurity on the subject, it was certainly not the fault of this department. ’Till the last resolutions, no call has been made upon it, which rendered it proper to exhibit a general view of the public monies and funds—or to shew the amount and situation of such as were unapplied. Particular calls for particular objects were made, which, as I conceive, were complied with; but they were not comprehensive enough to embrace a disclosure of that nature.  
It could not, therefore, with propriety, have been alleged, that there was a balance unaccounted for. To infer it, from documents, which contained only a part of the necessary information, was not justifiable. Nor could it otherwise happen, than that conclusions, wholly erroneous, would be the consequences of taking such imperfect data for guides.  
It may be of use, by way of elucidation, to point out some of the most palpable features of the error which has been entertained.  
The following items are stated, as the basis of the supposed deficiency:  
  
  
  Residue of the proceeds of the foreign bills supposed to be unapplied, after deducting the sums furnished for St. Domingo, and the amount of the debt to the foreign OfficersDollars,  
1.668.190.  
  
  
  
  Surplus of the sinking fund, meaning, I presume, that part of the surplus of the revenue to the end of the year 1790, which hath not been applied in purchases  
 400.000.  
  
  
  Surplus of revenue of the year 1792, as reported  
277.385.  
  
  
Deduct in Bank, meaning, I presume, the balance of the Treasurer’s Cash Account  
 790.642.  
  
  
    Balance not accounted for  
1.554.933.  
  
  
It appears, in the first place, to have been overlooked, that in Statement, No 3, of my late report concerning foreign loans, mention is made, that on the 3d of January there remained to be received of the proceeds of the foreign Bills, six hundred and thirty two thousand one hundred and thirty two dollars and two cents; consequently, that sum could not be considered, as in the treasury, and ought to be deducted from the supposed deficiency.  
Among the official papers, which, it is intimated, were consulted, was an original Account rendered by the Bank of the United States, of the sales of Amsterdam Bills, shewing a sum of six hundred and five thousand eight hundred and eighty three dollars and eight cents, as having been received by the Bank, and two of its Offices of discount and deposit, for the proceeds of those Bills. Had that document been understood, it would have been known, that this sum was in bank over and above the balance of the Treasurer’s Cash account; and this also would have served to account for a large part of the supposed deficiency namely, six hundred and five thousand eight hundred and eighty three dollars and eight cents. The course of this transaction will be hereafter explained.  
But among the misconceptions, which have obtained, what relates to the surplus of revenue of the year 1792, is not the least striking. The laws inform, (and consequently, no information on that point from this department could have been necessary) that credits are allowed upon the duties on imports, of four, six, nine, twelve months, and in some cases, of two years. Reason dictates, that a surplus in such case must be considered as postponed in the collection or receipt, ’till all the appropriations upon the fund have been first satisfied. The account of receipts and expenditures to the end of 1791, in possession of the House, shews, that at that time, no less a sum than one million eight hundred and twenty eight thousand two hundred and eighty nine dollars and twenty eight cents, of the antecedent duties, were outstanding in bonds. How, then, could it have happened, that the surplus of 1792 was sought for in the Treasury, at the very instant of the expiration of the year? I forbear to attempt to trace the source of a mistake so extraordinary.  
Let me, however, add, that of the surplus in question, one hundred and seventy two thousand five hundred and eighty four dollars and eighty two cents are not payable ’till April and May 1794, as will be seen by the Abstract E.  
Thus have I not only furnished a just and affirmative view of the real situation of the public account, but have likewise shewn, I trust, in a conspicuous manner, fallacies enough in the Statement, from which the inference of an unaccounted for balance is drawn, to evince, that it is one tissue of error. In this, I might have gone still further, there being scarcely a step of the whole process, which is not liable to the imputation of misapprehension. But I wish not unnecessarily to weary the patience of the House.  
Another circumstance, to which importance has been given, and which was noticed in connection with the suggestion last discussed, is a disagreement between a memorandum in the Treasurer’s Bank book, and the Statement reported by me of the amount of Bills drawn at the treasury upon the foreign fund. A disagreement, no doubt, exists, and to the extent of five millions seven hundred and sixty thousand one hundred and thirty eight florins or guilders.  
But the following circumstances contain the solution of this disquieting appearance.  
There will be found in the Statement A, two several credits, each for two millions of dollars, as for monies received into the treasury, with corresponding debits of equal sums, as for monies paid out of the treasury.  
But neither the one nor the other did, in reality take place. The whole is a mere operation to accomplish the purposes of the eleventh Section of the “Act to incorporate the Subscribers to the Bank of the United States,” without an inconvenient and unnecessary displacement of funds.  
That Section authorizes a subscription to the Stock of the Bank, on account of the Government, not exceeding in amount two millions of dollars, and provides for the payment of it, out of the monies, which should be borrowed, by virtue of either of the Acts of the fourth and twelfth of August 1790, the first making provision for the public debt, the last for reducing it; enjoining, at the same time, that a loan should be made of the Bank, to an equal amount, to replace the monies, which were to be applied to the payment of the subscription.  
It is evident, that nothing could have been more useless, (at the same time that it would have been attended with obvious disadvantages to the Government) than actually to draw from Europe out of the monies borrowed there, the sum necessary for the payment of the subscription to the Bank, and again to remit out of the loan, which was to be obtained of the Bank, a sufficient sum, to replace such monies, or such part of them, as may have been destined for the foreign object. Loss upon exchange in consequence of overstocking the market with Bills, Loss in interest by the delays incident to the operation; and which would necessarily have suspended the useful employment of the funds for a considerable time. These are some of the disadvantages to the Government. To the Bank alone could any benefit have accrued, which would have been in proportion to the delay in restoring or applying the fund to its primitive destination. Such an operation, therefore, could only have been justified by an indisposition, on the part of the Bank, to facilitate the principal object, without the intervention of actual payment.  
But no such disposition existed. On this, as on every other occasion, a temper, liberal towards the government, has characterized the conduct of the Directors of that institution.  
It was accordingly proposed by me and agreed to by them, that the object to be accomplished should be carried into effect by a merely formal arrangement. In this, however, it was necessary to consult the injunctions of law, and the principles of the constitution of the Treasury Department.  
These points then were to be effected—a payment of the subscription money, to vest the Government with the property of the Stock—possession of the means of paying it, which were to be derived from the foreign fund, and, of course, were first to be in the treasury, before payment could be made—the replacing what should be taken from that fund, by a loan of the Bank.  
The following plan for these purposes was devised an executed by previous concert.  
The Treasurer drew bills upon our Commissioners in Amsterdam, for the sums requisite to complete the payment on account of the subscription: these bills were purchased by the Bank, and Warrants in favor of the Treasurer upon the Bank served to place the proceeds in the treasury. Warrants afterwards issued upon the Treasurer, in favor of the Bank, for the amount of the subscription money, which was receipted on the part of the Bank, as paid. Other Warrants then issued in favor of the Treasurer upon the Bank, for equal sums, as upon account of a loan to the Government, which Warrants were satisfied by a redelivery to the Treasurer of the Bills which had been drawn upon the Commissioners. In the first place, warrants were drawn upon the Treasurer, to replace the monies supposed by the arrangement, to be drawn from the foreign fund, which perfected the operation. But from the detail, which has been given, it will be seen, that in fact, no monies were either withdrawn from, or returned to that fund. The Bills were cancelled, annexed to the warrants, and are lodged in the treasury, as vouchers of the transaction.  
These Bills were for two separate sums, each two millions four hundred and seventy five thousand guilders, equal to a million of dollars; the payment having been divided into two parts, upon certain equitable considerations, relative to the dividend of the first half year.  
This transaction explains four millions nine hundred and fifty thousand guilders, equal to the sum, which forms the disagreement, between the memorandum in the Treasurer’s Bank-book, and the Statement reported by me.  
The residue is thus explained. The sum of one million two hundred and thirty seven thousand five hundred guilders, directed to be drawn for, on the thirtieth of November, was directed to be comprised in one or more Bills, as the Bank should desire. It was at first placed in one Bill; but this Bill was afterwards returned, with a request that it might be converted into smaller sums. The Bill returned was cancelled, and in lieu of it, there had been furnished, prior to the first of January, of the present year, nine hundred and thirty four thousand five hundred guilders—the balance, three hundred and three thousand, then remaining to be furnished. The sum of nine hundred and thirty four thousand five hundred guilders, consequently appears twice in the memorandum.  
These two sums of four millions five hundred and ninety thousand, and nine hundred and thirty four thousand guilders, exceed the difference in question, by one hundred and twenty four thousand three hundred and sixty two guilders.  
The Treasurer informs me that there are two bills not included in the memorandum; one for one hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred and fifty, and the other for six hundred and twelve guilders; which make up the above mentioned excess. The former of those two bills was furnished to the Secretary of State, for the purpose contemplated by the third Section of the Act of the last Session, entitled “An Act making certain appropriations therein specified.”  
Is it not truly matter of regret, that so formal an explanation on such a point should have been made requisite? Could no personal enquiry of either of the Officers concerned, have superseded the necessity of publicly calling the attention of the House of Representatives, to an appearance in truth, so little significant? Was it seriously supposable, that there could be any real difficulty in explaining that appearance, when the very disclosure of it proceeded from a voluntary act of the head of this department?  
With perfect respect, I have the honor to be, Sir   Your most obedient and most Hble Servt.  
Alexander Hamilton.Secretary of the Treasury.  
The Honble. Jonathan Trumbull Esqr.Speaker of the House of Representatives.  
P:S: Another Statement of income and expenditure having been made, which presents the subject under aspect, but agreeing in the result with the Statement (B) is herewith also submitted, marked (B

S I R,  
r HAVE loft no time in preparing, as far  
as has been practicable, confidently with  
the course of tails, the several flatements  
required by the resolutions of the Hotife of  
Representatives of the twenty-third of last  
month ; and I have concluded to add to  
them such further flatements as appeared  
to me necetfary to convey fully the infor­  
mation, which is underitood to be the ob­  
ject of those resolutions. It was my firfl  
ntention to submit these flatements collec­  
tively, with such explanatory remarks as  
the occasion might demand. But finding  
on experiment, from the extent and variety  
of the matter involved in the resolutions  
that more time will be requisite for a full  
developement of it, than I had anticipated,  
confederations of weight in my mind have  
determined me to present the different parts  
of the fubjeCl successively. Among other  
advantages incident to this course of pro­  
ceeding, will be that of having it in my  
power to give a more accurate and mature  
view of the intire fubjeft, without too great  
a dereliction of the current business of the  
department. In executing the tail; I pro­  
pose to myfelf, I Jfhall rely on the icdul­  
  
gence of the House to a latitude of obser­  
vation, corresponding with the peculiar  
ciFcumftances of the cafe.  
The resolutions to which I am to answer  
fls&#x27;e not moved ithout a pretty copious  
■..&#x27;ifj«-&#x27;.v of the reasons on which they were  
liffcluled- These reasons are before the  
public, through the channcl of the press.  
They are of a nature to cxtfite attention—  
to beget alarm—to inspire doubts. De­  
ductions ol&#x27;a very extraordinary complex­  
ion may, without forcing the sense, be  
drawn from them.  
I feel it incumbent upon me to meet the  
suggestions which have been thrown out  
with decision and explicitnefs. And while  
I hope I {hall let fall nothing inconfiften  
with that cordial and unqualified refpef  
which I feel for the House of Reprefenta  
tives; while I acquiesce in the fufficienc;  
of the motives, that induced, on their part  
th«- giving a prompt and free course to th&lt;  
inveiligation proposed—l cannot but re­  
solve to treat the fubjeft with a freedom  
which is due to truth and to the confciouf­  
neft of a pure zeal for the public interest  
I begin with the last of the four refolu­  
rio..s; because it is that which seeks infor­  
mation relating to the mail delicate anc  
important of the that have beer  
hazarded.  
Here however I have to regret the uttei  
impossibility of a ftri£t compliance with the  
terms of the refoiution. The practicabili­  
ty of such a compliance would suppose no  
thilg less, than that ftnee the last day o:  
December, one thoufund seven hund-ec  
and ninety-two, all the accounts of the col  
leilors of the cufioms and other officers o  
the revenue, throughout the whole exten  
of ihe United States, could be digefled  
m;, je up and forwarded to theTreafury  
could be examined there, fettled and car  
rif, into the public books under their pro  
Pjfiieads: in a word, that all the account  
iWH&#x27;i&#x27;f?*?/;...&#x27;;, receipts ...Id txpe-tidiutf*  
of rhisextenfive country could have paflee  
through a complete exhibition, examina  
tion and adjustment, within the fliort pe  
riod of twenty-three days.  
tt was made (as I prefumefrom the re  
fult) fatisfa&amp;orily to appear to a committei  
of the House of Representatives, who weri  
charged during the last session with fram  
inga direction to the Treasury for bringing  
forward an annual account of receipts anc  
expenditures, that the course of public bu  
fine ft would not admit of the rendering o:  
such an account in less than nine months  
after the expiration of each year; in con  
fortuity to which idea their report iva  
farmed, and an order of the House eftab  
lifted.  
I need do nothing more to evince the im  
practicability of an exact ccAipliance wit!  
the refoiution in question, than to observe  
tJiat it is even more comprehensive, thougl  
with less detail, than the order of the House  
to which I have alluded.  
To evince nevertheless my readiness te  
do all in my power towards fulfilling the  
views of the House and throwing light up­  
on the tranfatlions of the department, 1  
{hall novv offer to their inspection fundi)  
statements marked A, AB, C, D, E, F.  
which contain as far as is at this time polfi­  
ble, the information deiired ; and with fuf­  
ficient certainty and accuracy to afford fa­  
tisfaction on the points of inquiry involvec  
in the refoiution.  
The statement A, {hews in ajbftract the  
whole of the receipts into and expenditures  
from the Treasury, commencing with the  
firft of January and ending with the last ol  
Dc*etriber one thousand seven hundred anc  
ninety-two, corresponding with the ac­  
counts of the Treasurer. These account:  
have been regularly fettled up to the enc  
of September, and copies have been laid be­  
fore the two houies of Congress. The ac­  
count for the quarter terminating with the  
year, has not yet paffeel through the form:  
of settlement, but is under examination,  
and will, no doubt, be fettled as it stands—  
the manner of conducting the business, and  
the usual care and accuracy of the officer  
concerned, leaving very little room to ap­  
prehend mif-ftateinent, or error. A copy  
of this account is herewith fubiflitted in the  
schedule marked C.  
This statement takes up the balance of  
the general account of receipts and expen­  
ditures to the end of the year one thousand  
seven hundred and ninety-one, as reported  
to the House of Representatives within the  
firft week of the prefen: session, and conti­  
nuing it down to the end of one thousand  
seven hunilred and ninety-two, {hews a ba­  
lance then in the Treasury of seven hundred  
and eighty-three thousand four hundred  
  
[Total No. 134.]  
  
and forty-four dollars and fifty-one cents.  
The statement B, is a more comprehen­  
sive document. It is a general account of  
income and expenditure. It Ihews not  
merely the actual receipts of money intothe  
Treaiiiry, but the whole amount of the na­  
tional revenues, from the commencement  
of the present government to the conclusion  
of the year one thousand seven hundred  
and ninety-two, as well out Jlanding as col­  
lected—the proceeds of domestic loans—the  
whole amount of the fuins which have been  
drawn into the United States, on account  
of the foreign loans—and all other monies  
from whatever source, which have accru­  
ed within the period embraced by the  
statement.  
These items form the debit fide of the  
account, amounting to seventeen millions  
eight hundred and seventy-nine thousand  
eight hundred and twenty-five dollars and  
thirty-three cent«.  
The credit fide consists of two items :  
I ■ The whole timotint of the actual expen­  
ditures to the end of the year one thousand  
seven hundred and ninety-one, as stated in  
the general account of receipts and expen­  
ditures before referred to. 11. sThe whole  
amount of the actual expenditure during  
the year one thousand seven hundred and  
ninety-two, as (pecified generally in the  
statement A, and particularly in the several  
quarterly accounts of the Treasurer, a­  
mounting to twelve millions seven hundred  
and (ixty-five thousand one hundred and  
twenty-eight dollars and eighty-three  
cents.&#x27;  
The balance of this account of income  
and expenditure is consequently five mil­  
lions one hundred and fourteen thousand  
(:x hundred and ninety-fix dollars and fifty  
cents; which corresponds with the exceft  
of the public income (including the pro­  
ceeds of loans, foreign and. domestic) be­  
yond the actual expenditure, or more pro­  
&gt;-•••. V. . ....r. tiicof  
the year one thousand seven hundred and  
ninety-two. This of course is exclusive of  
thftfe parts of the proceeds of foreign  
loans, which have been left in Europe to  
be applied there ; the amount, application  
and balance of which are exhibited, as far  
as they are yet known at the Treafurv, in  
the ltatement No. I. of my late report on  
foreign loan 3.  
This balance as noted in the statement B,  
is composed of the following particulars.  
I. Cash in the Treasury [pcr

inunicateii are proved by the oficial do­  
cuments already received, to have been  
eflentially correct.  
Iz will no doubt readily occur to the  
House, that a very small partipl the excess  
which has been Icated is a real surplus of  
income. There remain to be fatisfied nu­  
merous objects of expenditure charged up­  
on the fund by the which  
have been made, that cannot tail ultimately  
to exhaust it, probably within forvr or live  
htndrsd thousand dollars; winch will be  
embraced in the appropriations for thefer­  
vice of the year one thousand seven hun­  
dred and ninety-three. A further expla­  
nation-on this point is reserved for future  
communication.  
A due comprehension of the statements  
now prefeiited mult obviate every idea ol  
a balance unaccounted for ; in whatevei  
sense the allegation may have been intend­  
ed to be made.  
ll ill re was before any obfeurity on th(  
fulii it. it was certainly not the fault of thi:  
department. THI tl*e last resolutions, nt  
call has been made upon it which rendere&lt;  
it proper to exhibit a general vie-.vofthi  
public monies and funds—or to fliew th&lt;  
amount and lituation of such as were un  
applied. Particular calls for particulai  
•objects were made, which as I conceiv&lt;  
were complied with ; but they were no  
coraprehenjive enough to embrace a dif­  
cloture of that nature.  
It could not therefore with propriet;  
have been alledg-d, that there was aba  
lance unaccounted for—To inter it fron  
documents, which contained only a part o;  
the necellary information, was not jultilia­  
ble- Nor could it otherwise happen, thai  
that cojclutions, wholly erroneous, woulf  
be the consequences of . taking such imper­  
feci data for guides.  
It may be of use, by way of elucidati­  
on, to point out forne of the molt palpable  
feature of the er: or which lias been enter­  
tained.  
The following items are fiated as the ba­  
sis oi: the supposed deficiency :  
Keiidu ot the proceeds of  
the foreign bills supposed  
to be unapplied (after de­  
ducing the films furnillied  
for St. Domingo, and the  
amount of the debt to the  
foreign yififer?) , Dollars 1,668,190  
Surplus of linlcVngfund, mean­  
ing I presume that part of  
the surplus of the revenue  
to tlv. end of the year 1790,  
which had not been appli­  
ed in purchases 400,000  
Surplus of revenue of the year  
1792, as reported 277,385  
-■ „&#x27;,ii&gt;7s  
Dcduct in bank, meaning I  
presume the balance of tne  
Treasurer&#x27;s cadi account, 790,642  
Balance not accounted for 1,554,933  
It appears in the firft place, to have been  
overlooked, that in llatement No. 3 of m&gt;  
late report cone rning foreign loans, men­  
tion is made, ha. 011 the 3d of January,  
there remained to be received of the pro­  
ceeds of the foreign bills, fix hundred and  
thirty-two thousand one hundred and  
thirty-two dollars and two cents; conse­  
quently that sum could not be confulered  
as in the treasury, and ought to be deduct­  
ed from the supposed deficiency.  
A nong the official papers, which it is  
inti Kited were consulted, was an original  
account, rendered by the bank of the Uni­  
ted States, of the sales of Amsterdam bills,  
shewing a sum of lix hundred and five thou­  
sand eight hundred and eighty-three dol­  
lars and eight cents, as having been recei­  
ved by the bank and two of its offices ol  
discount and depolit, for the proceeds ol  
those bills. Had that document been 1111-  
derflood, it would nave been known, thai  
this sum was 111 bank over and above the  
balance of the Tieafurer&#x27;s calh account ;  
and this also would have forved to account  
for a large part of the supposed deficiency ;  
namely, °lix hundred and five thousand  
eight hundred and eighty-three dollars  
and eight cents. The course ofthistran­  
fatf ion will be hereafter explained.  
But among the misconceptions, which  
have obtained, what relates to the surplus  
of revenue of the year 1792, is not the  
least ftrilcing. The Laws inform (and  
consequently no information 011 that point  
from this department could have been ne­  
cellary that credits are allowed upon the  
duties on imports, of four, (ix, nine,  
twelve months, and in some cases of two  
years. Reason diCates, that a surplus in  
such cafe, must be conlidered as pollponecl  
in the collection or receipt, till all the ap­  
propriations upon the fund have been fir 11  
fatisfied. The account of receipts and ex­  
penditures to the end of 1791, in polfelfion  
of the House, l]iews that at that time, 110  
less a sum than Oi&gt;e million eight hundred  
and twenty-eight thousand two hundred  
* and eighty-nine dollars and twenty-eight  
cents of the antecedent duties were out­  
flanding in bonds. How then could it  
have happened, that the surplus of 1792  
was fought for in the treasury, at the -very  
instant of the expiration of the year—l for­  
bear to attempt to trace the source of a  
mistake so extraordinary !  
Let me however add, that of the surplus  
  
in qv.eftion, onehunihed and seventy-two  
thousand five hundred and eighty-lour dol­  
lars and eighty two cents are not payable  
till April and May 1794, as will be iVrwi  
by the abftratt [£•]  
Thus have I not only furniflied a just  
and afnrmative view of the real (ituatipnwf  
the public account, but havelikewife (hewn,  
I trull in a conspicuous manner, fallacies  
enough in the ffatenientj from which the  
inference of an unaccounted for balance  
is drawn, to evince that it is one tHfuc ol  
error. In this, I might have gone (till  
further, there being scarcely a step of the  
whole process, which is not liable to the  
imputation of mifapprelienlion. But 1  
with not unneceflarily to weary the pati­  
ence of the House  
Another circumstance, to which im­  
portance has been given, and which   
noticed in connection with the fuggeftior  
last difcutfed, is a disagreement between  
a memorandum in the Treasurer&#x27;s bank­  
book, and the llatement reported by me  
of the amount of bills drawn at the troi&gt;-  
fury upon the foreign fund. A dilagtee­  
ment no doubt exists, and to the cxteut&#x27;ol  
live millions seven hundred and lixty thoti­  
fand one hundred and thirty-eight florins  
or guilders.  
But the following circumftanees contain  
the solution of this disquieting appear­  
ance.  
There will be found in the statement  
TA] two several credits each for two mil­  
lions of dollars, a, for monies received in­  
to the treasury with correlponding debit:  
of equal sums, as for monies paid out ol  
the treasury.  
But neither the one nor the other did ii  
reality take place. The whole is a mere  
operation, to accompliih the purposes ol  
theiith feftion of the &quot;Act to incorp«  
rate the fubferibers to the bank of the  
United States ; without an inconvenient  
ind unneceflary displacement of fundi.  
That section authorises a fubfeription tc  
the (lock of the bank, on account of the  
jovernment, not exceeding in amount twe  
millions of dollars, and provides for the  
payment of it out of the monies, which  
Ihould be borrowed by virtue of either oi  
the acts of the fourth and twelfth of Au­  
511ft 1790, the firlt making provision for  
the public debt, the last for reducing it,  
enjoining at the fame time, that a loau  
(liould be made of the bank to an equal a­  
mount. to rcplace the monies, which were  
to be applied to the payment of the ftib-  
Icription.  
It is evident, that nothing could have  
aeen more useless, (at the fame time that  
it would have been attended with obvious  
ilifadvantages to the government) jhar  
actually to draw from Europe out oQUje  
monies borrowed there, tits IMMf&#x27;lift &quot;  
for the payment of the fubfeription to ti.  
bank, and again to remit out of the loan  
which was to be obtained of the bank, 1  
&quot;ufficient sum to rcplace such monies, 01  
&quot;uch part of them as may have been defti­  
lcd for the foreign objett. Loss upon ex­  
change, in consequence of overllockinj  
the market with bills—Loss in interest b}  
the delays incident to the operation ; anc  
which would necefiarily have fufpendet  
the ufeful employment of the funds for ;  
coniiderable time. Thefearefome of the  
tlifadvantages to the government. To the  
bank alone could any benefit have ac­  
crued, which would have been in propor  
tion to the delay in restoring or applying  
the fund to its primitive destination.—  
Such an operation therefore could O11I)  
have been jnllified by an indifpolition or  
the part of the bank to facilitate the prin­  
cipal object, without the intervention oi  
aitual payment.  
But no such difpolition existed. Or  
this, as 011 every other occa(ion, a tenjpci  
liberal towards the government has cha­  
ra£terifed the conduct of the directors oi  
that institution.  
It was accordingly proposed by me, antl  
agreed to by them, that the object to be  
accomplilhed Ihould be carried into el£e£t,  
by a merely formal arrangement. In  
this however it was neceflai y to consult  
the injunctions of law, anil the principles oi  
the constitution of the treasury depart­  
ment.  
These points then were to be effected—  
a payment of the fubfeription money tc  
vest the government with the property ol  
the flock— poflellion of the means of g&lt;iy­  
ingit, which were to be derived from rhi  
foreign fund.&#x27;and of course were firftto be  
in the treasury, before payment could be  
made—the replacing what (houkl be takei  
from that fund, by a loan of the bank.  
The following plan for these purpose:  
was devised and executed by previouscon­  
cert.  
The Treasurer drew bills upon oui  
commissioners in Amsterdam for the fbm  
requisite to complete the payment on ac­  
count of the fubfeription. These bills wen  
purchased by the bank, and warrants ir  
favour of the Treasurer upon the banl  
leryed toplace the proceccK in the treasu­  
ry. Warrants afterwards Kitted upon tin  
Treasurer, in favour of the bank, for tht  
amount of the fubfeription money, whicl  
was receipted for on the part of the bank  
as paid. Other warrants then iflued ii  
favor of the Treasurer upon ihe bankfoi  
equal sums, as upon account of a loan t&lt;  
the government; which warrants wert  
falistied by a re-delivery to t!je Treafurei  
  
of the bills that had been drawn upon the  
commiflioners. In the last place warrants  
were drawn upon the Treasurer to replacc  
the monies supposed by the arrangement  
to be drawn from the foreign fnnd, which  
perfected the operation. But from the  
detail which has been given, it will be  
seen, that in fact no monies were either  
withdrawn from or returned to that fund.  
The bills were cancelled, anhexed to the  
warrants, and are lodged in the treasury,  
as vouchers of the tranfaftion.  
These bills were for two separate turns,  
each two millions four hundred and feven­  
ty-five thousand guilders, equal to a milli­  
on of dollars; the payment having been  
divided into two parts, upon certain equi­  
table coniiderations relative to the divi­  
dend of the firft half year.  
This tranfaclion explains four millions  
nine hundred and fifty thousand guilders  
of the sum which forms the disagreement  
between the memorandum in the Treasu­  
rer&#x27;s bank book and the statement repor­  
ted by me.  
The reiidile is thus explained. The  
sum of one million two hundred and thir­  
ty seven thousand five hundred guilders,  
directed to be drawn for on the thirtieth  
of November, was directed to be compri­  
sed in one or more bills, as the bank  
(hould delire. It was at firft placed in  
one bill ; but this bill was afterwards re­  
turned, with a request that it might be  
onverted into smaller films. The bill  
returned was cancelled , and in lieu of it,  
there had been furnilhed prior to the firli  
of January of the present year, nine hun­  
dred and thirty four thousand five hundred  
guilders—the balance three hundred and  
three thousand then remaining to be fur­  
nilhed—Thefumof ninehundred and thir­  
ty four thousand live hundred guilders con­  
feqii tly appears twice iu the memoran­  
dum.  
These two funis of four millions five  
hundred and ninety thousand and nine  
hundred and thirty four thousand guilders,  
exceed the difference in queltion by one  
hundred and twenty four thousand three  
hundred and sixty two guilders.  
The Treaftirer informs me, that there  
are two bills not included in the memoran­  
dum, one for one hundred and twenty  
three thousand seven hundred and fifty,  
ind the other for fix hundred and twelve  
guilders ; which make up the above men­  
tioned excess. The former of these two  
bills was furnilhed to the Secretary ot  
State,for thepurpofe contemplated by the  
third feftion of the ast oi the last feilion,  
&quot; An ast making certain appro­  
priations therein fpecified.&quot;  
Is it not trnly matter of regret, that so  
formal an explanation on ftich a point,  
-&#x27;..ild have been mode requisite r Couiil  
i- personal inquiry of either of the officers  
concerned have luperfeded the neccflity  
of publicly calling the attention of the  
House of Representatives, to an appear­  
ance, in truth, so little fignificant ? Was it  
lerioufly fuppofeable, that there could be  
any real ditaculty in explaining that ap­  
pearance, when the very disclosure of it  
proceeded from a voluntary ast of the

SIR,  
  
I HAVE loft no time in preparing, as  
far as has been pra&amp;icable, confident­  
ly with the courfc of facts, the several  
statements required by the resolutions of  
the House of Representatives of the 23d  
of lad month ; and I have concluded to  
add to them such further statements as ap­  
peared to me necessary to convey fully the.  
information which is ur.derftood to be the  
cbjeft of those resolutions. It was my firft  
intention to submit these Statements col­  
lectively, with such explanatory remarks  
as the occasion might demand ; but find­  
ing on experiment, from the extent and  
variety of the mater involved in the reso­  
lutions, that more time will be riquifite for  
a full development of it than I had anti­  
cipated, considerations of weight in my  
mind have determined me to present the  
different parts of the fubjeft successively.  
Among other advantages incident to this  
course of proceeding, will be that of hav­  
ing it in my power to give a more accu­  
rate and mature view of the entire fubje£t,  
without too great a dereliction of the cur­  
rent business of the Department. In exe­  
cuting the task I propose to myfelf, I  
rely on the indulgence of the House  
to a latitude of observation, correfpopd­  
ing with the peculiar circumstances of  
the cafe.  
  
The resolutions to wliich I am to an­  
swer, were not moved without a pretty  
copious display of the reasons on which  
they were founded. These reasons are be­  
fore the public, through the channel of  
the prefe. They are of a nature to excite  
attention—to beget alarm—to inspire  
doubts. Deductions of a very extraordi­  
nary completion may, without forcing  
the sense, be drawn from them.  
  
I feel it incumbent upon me to meet  
t&#x27;ae suggestions, which have been thrown  
out, with decision and explicitnefs. And  
while I hope, 1 lhall let fall nothing in­  
consistent with the cordial and unqualified  
refpeft which I feel for the House of Re­  
prefcntatives,—while I acquiesce in the  
fufficiency of the motives that induced on  
their part the giving a prompt and free  
course to the invcftigation proposed—l  
cannot but lefolve to treat the fubje&amp; with  
a freedom which is due to truth and to  
the consciousness of a pure zeal for the  
public interest.  
I begin with the last of the four resolu­  
tions ; because it is th»t which seeks in­  
formation relative to the most delicate and  
important of the suggestions that have  
been hazarded.  
  
Here however I have to regret the ut­  
ter impoflibility of a drift compliance  
with the terms of the resolution. The  
  
pra&amp;icability of such a compliance would  
suppose nothing less than that lince the  
feu of December 1792, all the ac­  
counts of all the CdHe&amp;ors of the Customs  
and other officers of the Revenue through­  
out the whole extent of the United States  
could be digested, made up, and forward­  
ed to the Titafury,—-&gt;ould be examined  
thete, fettled and carried into the public  
books under their proper heads. In a  
word, that all the accounts df the reve­  
nues, receipts and expenditures of this ex­  
tensive country, could have passed through  
a complete exhibition, examination and  
adjustment, within the fliort period of  
twenty-three days.  
  
It was made (as I presume from the re-*  
fult) fatisfa&amp;orily to appear to a Com­  
mittee of the Konfe of Representatives,  
who were charged during the lad fefiion  
with framing a direction to the Treasury  
for bringing foi ward an annual account of  
Receipts and Expenditures, that the  
course of public bufmefs would not admit  
of the rendering offuch an account in less  
than nine months after the expiration of  
each year ; in conformity to which idea  
their report was formed and an order of  
the Hotifc eftablithed.  
  
I need do nothing more, to evince the  
impra&amp;icability of an exact compliance  
with the resolution in question, than to  
observe, that it is even more comprehen­  
sive (though with less detail) than the or­  
der of the House &quot;to which I have allud­  
ed.  
  
To evince nevertheless my readiness to  
do all in my power towatds fulfilling the  
views of the House, and throwing light  
upon the tranfaftjons of the department,  
  
I (hall now offer to their infpe&amp;ion sun­  
dry statements marked A, AB, B, C, D,  
E» F, which contains as far as is at this  
time poflible, the information defir«d,—  
and with fufficient accuracy to afford fa­  
tisfa&amp;ion on the points of enquiry involv­  
ed in the Resolution.  
  
The Statement A, shews in ahftradi  
the whole of the Receipts into, and Ex­  
penditurs from the Treasury, commencing  
with the firft of January and ending with  
the lad of December 1792,—correspond-  
ing with the accounts of the Treasurer.  
These accounts have been regjplarty Fet­  
tled lip to the end of September, and co­  
pies have been laid before the two Houses  
of Congress. The account of the quarter  
terminating with the year, has not yet  
palled through the forms of settlement—  
but is fonder examination, and will, no  
doubt, be fettled as it Hands,—the man­  
ner of conducting the business and the  
usual care and accuracy of the officer con­  
cerned leaving very little room to appre­  
hend miftatement or error. A copy of it  
is herewith transmitted in the schedule  
marked C. g§  
  
This Statement takes up the balance of  
the General Account of Receipts and Ex­  
penditures, to the end of the year -1791»  
as repotted to the House of Representa­  
tives, within the firft week ofthe present  
fefiion, and continuing it down to the end  
of 1792, Ihevvs a balance then tn the  
Treasury of 783,444 dollars and 51 cents.  
The Statement B is a .more compre­  
hensive document. It is k Ac­  
count of Income and Expenditure. It  
(hews not merely the actual Reciptc of  
money into the Treasury, but the whole  
amount of the National Revenues from  
the commencement of the present g#vern­  
ment to the conclusion of the yea* 1791,  
as well out/landing as colle&amp;ed,—the pro­  
ceeds of domestic loans,—the whole a­  
mount of the sums which have been drawn  
  
into the United States on account of the  
proceeds of the foreign loans, *and  
all other monies, from whatever source,  
which have accrued, within the period  
embraced by the statement.  
These items form the debit iide of the  
account amounting to 1 dol-  
  
lars and 33 cents.  
Thecreditfide conlilts of two items.First,  
the whole amount of the actual expendi­  
tures to the end of the year 1791, as dat­  
ed in the General Account of Receipts  
and Expenditures before referred to. Se­  
cond, the whole amount of the actual ex­  
penditures during the year 179®, as fpe­  
cified generally in the ftatemeat A, and  
particularly in the several quarterly ac­  
counts of the Treasurer, amounting to  
  
14,765, iaß dollars and 83 cents.  
The balance of the Account of Incotne  
and Expenditure is consequently 5,114-  
696 dotlars and 50 cents ; which corre­  
sponds with the Excess of the Public In­  
come (including the proceeds ofloans fo­  
reign and domestic) beyond the a&amp;ual  
Expenditure, or more properly speaking,  
Di/iurfement to the end of the year 179»»  
This of coutfe is exclusive of thafe parts  
of the proceedis of foreign loani y/hich  
have been left in Europe to be ,applied  
there ; the amount, application and ba­  
lance are exhihited, as far as they are yet  
known at tbe Statement  
No. 1, of my late report on foreign loans.  
. This Balance, as noted in the State­  
ment B, is composed of the following par­  
ticulars :  
I. Calh in the Treafury,per Dollars,  
{latement A. 785444 .51  
11. Calh in the Bank of the Uni­  
ted States, and the Offices of Dis­  
count and Deposit of New York,  
and Baltimore, not yet passed to  
the account of the Treasurer, per  
statement A, B.  
111. Proceeds of Amsterdam bills  
remaining in depolit in the Bank ,  
of North America, including the  
fumof 156,595 dollars and 56, cts.  
advanced by the Bank without in-1 &#x27;  
tereft, which is credited in the ge­  
neral account of receipts and ex­  
penditures, ftatemefit A,  
IV. Proceeds of Amsterdam bills

V. Ca(h in hands of colleitors of  
customs, per ab(lra£t D, 151851 25  
VI. Bonds unpaid at the end of  
the year 1792, on account of the  
duties on imports, and falling due  
between that time and May 1794,  
per abftraa E, 2442069 15  
VII. Uncolle&amp;ed residue of du- &#x27;  
ties on spirits distilled within the  
United States, per abftra&lt;st F,  
  
This aggregate fomewliat exceeds the  
balance of the account ; but in cafe wbere  
estimates mull necessarily supply the defi­  
  
290  
  
cieney of ascertained results, differences  
ef this nature are of course. It is at the  
fame time fatisfattory to observe, that the  
efti mates which have been heretofore com­  
municated are proved by the official docu­  
ments already received, to have been el­  
fentially correct.  
It will no doubt readily occur to the  
House that a very small part of the excess,  
which has been stated, is a real futplus of  
income. There remain to be fatislied ob­  
fe&amp;s of Expenditure charged, upon the  
fund by the appropriations which have  
been made, that cannot fail ultimately to  
exhautt it probably within four or five  
hundred thousand dollars ; which will be  
embraced in the appropriations for the  
service of the year 1793. A further ex­  
planation on this point is reserved for fu­  
ture communication.  
  
A due comprehension of the statements  
now presented, mud obviate every idea of  
a balance unaccounted for ; in whatever  
sense the allegation may have been intend­  
ed to be made.  
  
If there was before any obfeurity on  
the fubjedt, it was cettainly not the fault  
of this Department. Till the last reflati­  
ons, no call has been made upon it, which  
rendered it proper to exhibit a general  
view of the public monies and funds,—or  
to (hew the amount and situation of such  
as were unapplied. Particular calls for par­  
ticular objects were made which as I con­  
ceive were complied with ; but they were  
not comprehensive enough to embrace a  
difclofuit of that nature.  
  
It could not theiefore with propriety  
have been alledged that there was a ba­  
lance unaccounted for. To infer it fron.  
documents, which contained only a part  
of the necessary information, was not juf­  
tifiable, nor could it otherwise happen,  
than that conclusions wholly erroneous  
would be the consequences of taking such  
imperfect data for guides.  
It may be of use by way of elucidation,  
to point out some of the tnoft palpable  
features of the errors which has been en­  
tertained.  
  
The following Items are dated as the  
balls of the supposed deficiency :  
Residue of the proceeds of the Fo­  
r eign bills supposed to be unapplied  
[after deducing the sums furnifhed  
for St. Domingo, and the amount of  
the debt to Foreign officers]  
Surplus of Sinking Fund, meaning,  
that part of the surplus of the revenue  
to the end of the year 1790, which  
had not been applied in purchases  
Surplus of the revenue of the year  
1791, as reported  
  
Dollars 4345575  
Dedu&lt;3 in Bank, meaning, I pre­  
sume, the balance of the trcalurer&#x27;s  
cash account,  
  
It appears in the fit ft place to have been  
overlooked! that in Statement No. 3, of  
my late report concerning foreign loans,  
mention is made, that on the 3d of Janu­  
ary there remained to be received of the  
proceeds of the foreign bills 633,131 dol­  
lars and two cents; consequently that  
sum could not be confldeted a« in the  
Treasury, and ought to be deduced  
from the supposed deficiency.  
  
Among the official papers which it i»  
intimated were consulted, was an original  
account, rendered by the Bank of the  
United States, of the falesof Amsterdam  
Bills, (hewing a sum of 605,883 dollars  
and&#x27;B cents, as having been received by  
the Bank and two of its Offices of Dis­  
count and Depolit, for the proceeds of  
Ihofe Bills. Had that document beer, un­  
derstood, it would have been known, that  
this sum was in Bank over and above the  
Balance of the Treasurer&#x27;s Cash Account;  
and this also would have served to ac­  
count for a large part of the supposed de­  
ficiency ; namely 605,883 dollars and 8  
cents. The course of this tranfa&amp;ion will  
be hereafter explained.  
  
605883 o8  
  
But among the misconceptions which  
have obtained, what telatesto the surplus  
of Revenue for the year 1792, is not the  
least striking. Thelcmis inform (andcon­  
fequently no information on that point  
from this Department could have been  
necelTary) that credits are allowed upon  
the duties on Imports, of four, fix, nine,  
twelve months, and in some cases of two  
years. Reason dictate«, that a surplus in  
such cafe, mull be considered as poltpon­  
ed in the Collection or Receipt, till all the  
appropriations upon the fund have been  
firft fatisfied. The account of Receipts  
and Expenditures for the year 1791, in  
pofleflion of the House, shews that at that  
time, no less a sum than 1,828,289 dol­  
  
17799s 80  
  
341057 19  
  
Dollars j 110897 00  
  
Balaacc unaccounted for  
  
lars and *8 cents of the anticeduft  
were outtlanding in Bonds. How thcn  
could it have happened, that the furplU!  
of 1792, was fought for in the 1 ,eafUry  
at the very infant of the expiration of t&amp;  
year ? I forbear to attempt to rrace ih«  
fourceof a mistake To extraordinary.  
Let me however add, that of the Sut.  
plus in queftioh, 172,584 dollars and 8:  
cents, ate not payable till April and May  
1794, as will be seen by the A hit raft £.  
Thus have I not only furntfhed a jult  
and affirmatiVtf&quot;*iew of the realisation  
of the PublTc Account, but have liltewifc  
shewn, 1 trust in a conspicuous &#x27;manner,  
fallacies enough in the Statement, front  
which the inference ot an unaccounted for  
balance is drawn, to evince that it is one  
tilTue of error. In this, I might have gont  
still further, there being scarcely a ftepoi  
the whole process, which is not liable to  
the imputation of mifapprehenfton. Bat  
I wi(h not unnecessarily to weary the pa.  
tience of the House,  
  
Another circumstance to which im.  
portance has been given, and which »ai  
noticed in connection with the suggestion  
last difcqfled, is a disagreement between  
a Memorandum in the Treafufer&#x27;s Bank  
Book and the Statement reported by me,  
of the amount of Bills drawn at the Trea.  
  
fury upon the Foreign Fund. Such a dis­  
agreement no doubt exists, and to the ex­  
tent of 5,760,138 florins or guilders—  
But the following circumstances con­  
tain the solution of tjjis di&amp;mistiDg ap­  
pearance.  
There will he found in the Statement  
A, two several credits; each for  
2,000,000 dollars, as for monies received  
into the Treasury, with correfpondino  
Debits of equal sums as for monies paid  
out of the Treasury.  
  
But neithei the one t)or the other did  
  
in reality take place. The whole is a  
mere operation, to accomplish the purpo-  
  
Fes of the Xlth feftion of the ast to incor­  
porate the fubferibers to the Bank of the  
United States} without an inconvenient  
and unneceflary displacement of&lt; funds.  
  
That Section authorizes a subscription  
to the stock of the Bank, on account of  
  
the Government, not exceeding in a­  
mount two millions of dollars, and pro­  
vides for the payment of it out of the mo­  
nies which (hould be borrowed by virtue  
of either of the acts of the 4th and nth  
of August 1790, the firft making provisi­  
on for the public Debt, the la ft for reduc.  
  
1668190  
  
400000  
  
ing it ; enjoining at the fame time, that a  
Loan should be made of the Bank to an  
equal amount, to replace the monies  
which were to be applied to the payment  
of the fubfeription.  
It is evident, that nothing could have  
been more useless (at the fame time that  
it would have been attended with obvious  
disadvantages to the government) than  
actually to draw from Europe, out of th«  
monies borrowed there, the sum necessary  
for the payment of the Subscription to  
the Batik, and again to remit out of the  
Loan which was to be obtained of the  
Bank a fufficient sum to replace those mo­  
nies or such part of them as may have  
been dellined for the foreign dbjeft. Loss  
upon exchange in consequence of over­  
(locking of the market with Bills.—Loss  
in i«vtercft by the &lt;Jelayfr incident to (!«:&lt;*  
peration ; and which would necessarily  
have suspended the ufeful employment ot  
the fund for a considerable time. These  
are some of the disadvantages to the Go­  
vernment. To the Bank alone could any  
benefit have acctued ; which would have  
been in proportion to the delay in re&#x27;t°r&#x27;  
ing or applying the fund to its primitive  
destination. Such an operation therefore  
could only have been juftified by an io­  
difpofition on the part of the Bank to fa­  
cilitate the principal object, without the  
intervention of actual payment.  
But no such disposition existed. On  
this, as on every other occlfion, a temper  
liberal towards the Government has cha­  
rafterifed the condudt of the Directors o  
that institution.  
It was accordingly proposed by rnfi  
and agreed to by them, that the objev to  
be accomplished should be carried ,ntc  
effect by a merely formal arrangement.  
In this however it was neoefiary to cos&#x27;  
fult the injunctions of law, and the Prin&quot;  
ciples of the constitution of the Trea urJ  
Department. ,  
These points then were to be eiiettea  
a payment of the Subscription money, ,c  
veil the Government with the property  
of the Stock,—possession of the means ol  
paying it, which were to be derived row  
the foreign fund, and ofcourfe were  
to be in the Tieafury before payment

Cbitld .be made,—the replacing what  
fhouid be taken from that fund, by a loan  
of the Bank.  
  
The following plan for these purposes  
was devised and executed, by previous  
conceit— •  
  
The Treasurer drew bills upon the  
Commifiioners in Amsterdam forthe sums  
Tequifite to complete the payment on ac­  
count of the subscription : These bills  
were purchased by the Bank, and war­  
rants in favour of the Treasurer upon the  
Bank served to place ii\e proceeds in the  
Treasury. Warrants afterwards iffijed  
upon the Treasurer, in favour, of the Bank  
for the amount of the subscription money  
which was receipted for on the part of the  
Bailk, as paid. Other warrants then is­  
sued in favour of the Treasurer upon the  
Bank, for equal sums, as upon account of  
a Loan to the Government; which war­  
rants were fatisfied by a re-delivery to the  
Treasurer of the bills that had been drawn  
Upon the Commifiioners- In the last place,  
wai rants were drawn upon the Treasurer,  
to replace the monies supposed by the ar­  
rangement to be drawn from the foreign  
fund, which perfedted the opeiation. But  
from the detail, whicr« has been given, it  
will be seen that in faß no monies were ei­  
ther withdrawn from or returned to that  
fund. The bills were cancelled, annexed  
to the Warrants, and are lodged in the  
Treasury as vouchers of the tranfaftiop.  
These bills were for two separate sums  
each 3.4.7 TiQQQ Guilders, equal to a mil­  
lion of Dollars ; the payment having  
been divided into two parts, upon certain  
equitable considerations, relative to the  
dividend cf the firft half year.  
This tranfa&amp;ion explains 4,950,000  
Guilders, of thefum which forms the dis­  
agreement between the memoiandum in  
the Tieafurets Bank Book and the State­  
ment reported by me.  
  
The residue is thus explained. The  
sum of 1,237,500 Guilders, dire&amp;ed to  
i&gt;e drawn for, on the 30th of November,  
was direiled to be coinprifed in one or  
more bills, as the Bank (hould desire. It  
was at fit It placed in one bill; but this  
bill was.afterwards returned, with a re­  
quell tha it might be converted into smal­  
ler sums. The Bill returned was cancel­  
led ; and in lieu of it, there had been fur­  
nifhed prior to the tirll of Jauuaty of the  
present years 934..5&amp;oGuildcis,—the bal­  
ance hc.&gt; - fat­  
pifhed. The sum of 934,500 Guilders  
consequently ajjpeiued twice in the Me­  
morandum.  
  
These two sums of 4,590,000 and  
934,500 Guilders, exceed the difference  
inqueftionby 124,362 Guilders.  
The Trcafurer informs me, that .there  
are two bills not included in the memo­  
randum ; one for 113,750 and the other  
for 612 Guilders ; which make up the n­  
bove-mentioned excess. The former of  
these two bills was furnifhed to the Secre­  
tary of State foi the purpose contemplat­  
ed by the 3d feftion of the Ast of the  
]»ft session, entitled, &quot; An Ast making  
certain appropiiations therein fpecified.&quot;  
Is it not truly matter of regret, that so  
formal an explanation on such a point,  
Should have been made requisite ? Could  
no personal enquiry of either of the offi­  
cers concerned, have fuperfsded the neoef­  
lity of publicly calling the attention of  
the House of Representatives to an ap­  
pearance, in tiuth, so little fignifiennt ?  
Was it seriously fuppofeable that there  
conld be any real difficulty in explaining  
that appearance, when the very disclosure  
of it proceeded from a voluntary ast of  
the Head of this Department ?  
With peifeft refpeft,  
I have the honor to be, Sir,  
Your moll obedient,  
And molt humble Servant,
