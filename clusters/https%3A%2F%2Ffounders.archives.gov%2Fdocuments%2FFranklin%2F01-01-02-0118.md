	Last Saturday Morning died here, the Lady of our worthy Governor, at his Country-House near this City, after an Illness which for some Months past had seized her, tho’ she was confined to her Bed four days only before her Death: Her Corpse being brought to Town early on Sunday Morning was decently and honourably interred in our Church about Eight in the Evening. She was descended of an honourable Family in the Southern part of Scotland, which suffered much thro’ their too great Attachment to that unhappy Prince King James the Second: Her two Brothers bred up by their Father in the Protestant Religion, being afterwards seduced from it, the Eldest, dead some years since, held an high Office in the Court of the late Duke of Tuscany, and the other is now Confessor to His most Catholick Majesty. This Lady was much esteemed by all that knew her, for her solid good Sense, exemplary Piety and extensive Charity, in which last few were more private, or according to their Circumstances more bountiful to the unfortunate. She died a true Protestant of the Communion  of the Church of England, for which she had so great an Esteem and Veneration, that very advantageous Offers made to her by her Brothers could not draw her aside from a strict Adherence to the Principles of that excellent Church. Her Death is universally lamented here, and she has left behind her a numerous Family to deplore their irreparable Loss. [September 19]
