“ Whereas, Congress have received information that John Paulding,  
David Williams and Isaac Van Wart, three young volunteer militia-  
men of the State of New York, did, on the 23d day of September  
last, intercept Major André, Adjutant-General of the British army,  
on his return from the American lines, in the character of a spy;  
and, notwithstanding the large bribes offered them for his release,  
nobly disdaining to sacrifice their country for the sake of gold,  
secured and conveyed him to the commanding officer of the district,  
whereby the dangerous and traitorous conspiracy of Benedict  
Arnold was brought to light, the insidious designs of the enemy  
baffled and the United States rescued from impending danger,  
  
“ Resolved, That Congress have a high sense of the virtuous and  
patriotie conduct of the said John Paulding, David Williams and  
Isaac Van Wart.  
  
“In testimony whereof: ORDERED, That each of them receive  
annually, out of the Public Treasury, Two Hundred Dollars in specie,  
or an equivalent in current money of these States, during life, and  
that the Board of War procure for each of them a silver medal, on  
one side of which shall be a shield with this inscription: ‘ Fidelity,’  
and the other the following motto, ‘ Vincit Amor Patrice,’ and for-  
ward them to the Commander-in-Chief, who is requested to present  
the same, with a copy of this resolution and the thanks of Congress  
for their fidelity, and the eminent service they have rendered their  
country.”
