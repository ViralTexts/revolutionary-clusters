Sir,  
Department of State January 5th 1804  
The information and observations which you have as yet received from me since your arrival in London, on the impressment of our seamen, and other violations of our rights, have been in private letters only. The delay in making these injuries the subject of official communications, proceeded first from an expectation that the British Government would have notified formally to the United States, as a neutral power, the state of war between Great Britain and France, which would have been an apt occasion, for combining with assurances of the fairness with which our neutral obligations would be fulfilled, our just claims on a correspondent respect for our neutral rights, and particularly of those which had been least respected during the last war: secondly from the expected arrival of Mr. Merry, which, if he should not be charged with such a notification, might be a favorable opportunity for commencing the explanations and discussions which must precede a thorough correction of the wrongs which we experience.  
Since the arrival of Mr. Merry, accordingly, no time has been lost in calling his attention to the subject, and in preparing both it and him, for the negotiation which is now to be committed to you. If appearances are to be trusted, his impressions and representations will be friendly to it. In my conversations with him, which have been free and full, he has expressed the best dispositions, has listened with candor to the appeals made as well to the considerations of justice, as of the solid interest of his nation; and altho’ he suggests serious difficulties on certain points, he will, I believe, sincerely co-operate in lessening them, and in bringing about an arrangement which will be acceptable to this country. The only topic on which any thing has passed in writing between the Department of State and him, is that of the pretended blockade of St Domingo. Copies of my letter to him, and of his answer, are herewith enclosed; as also of the letter written to Mr. Thornton some time before, and referred to in that to Mr Merry, in relation to a like blockade of Martinique and Guadaloupe.  
Altho’ there are many important objects which may be thought to invite conventional regulations between the United States and Great Britain, it is evedently proper to leave for subsequent consideration, such as are less urgent in their nature or more difficult in their adjustment; and thereby to render the way plainer and shorter to an agreement with respect to objects which cannot be much longer delayed without danger to the good understanding of the two nations. With this view, the plan of a Convention contemplated by the President, is limitted to the cases of impressments of our seamen, of blockades, of visiting and searching our vessels, of contraband of war, and of the trade of hostile Colonies, with a few other cases affecting our maritime rights; embracing however, as inducements to Great Britain to do us justice therein, a provision for the surrender of deserting seamen and soldiers, and for the prevention of contraband supplies to her enemies.  
The plan digested for your use is subjoined. The first column contains the articles which are to be proposed in the first instance, and which are considered as within our just expectations: The second modifies the articles into the concessions which the British Government may possibly require, and which it may be expedient for us ultimately to admit.  
A Convention between the United States and Great Britain  
  
  
1st Proposal.  
2d &amp; Ultimatum.  
  
  
Art. 1   No person whatever, shall upon the high seas and without the jurisdiction of either party, be demanded or taken out of any ship  or vessel belonging to citizens or subjects of one of the other parties, by the public or private armed ships belonging to or in the service of the other, unless such person be at the time in the Military service of an enemy of such other party.  
  
Art 1   No seaman, sea faring or other person, shall upon the high seas and without the jurisdiction of either party be demanded or taken out of any ship or vessel belonging to the citizens or subjects of one of the parties, by the public or private armed ships belonging to or in the service of the other party; and strict and effectual orders shall be given for the due observance of this engagement; but it is to be understood that this article shall not exempt any persons on board the ships of either of the parties from being taken thereout, by the other party, in cases where they may be liable to be so taken according to the laws of nations; which liability however, shall not be construed to extend in any case to seamen, or sea faring persons being actually part of the crew of the vessel in which they may be, nor to persons of any description passing from one port to another port of either of the parties.  
  
  
Art II   Same.  
Art. II No person, being a subject or citizen of one of the parties, and resorting to or residing in the dominions of the other, shall in any case be compelled to serve on board any vessel whether public or private belonging to such other party: And all citizens or subjects whatever of the respective parties, at this time compulsively serving on board the vessels of the other, shall be forthwith liberated, and enabled by an adequate recompence to return to their own Country.  
  
  
Art III   Same.  
Art III   If the ships of either of the parties shall be met with, sailing either along the coasts or on the high seas by any ship of war or other public or private armed ship of the other party, such ships of war or other armed vessels shall; for avoiding all disorder, in visiting and examining the same, remain out of cannon shot, unless the state of the sea or the place of meeting render a nearer approach necessary, and shall in no case compel or require such vessel to send her boat or her papers or any person from on board, to the belligerent vessel; but the belligerent vessel may send her own boat to the other and may enter her to the number of two or three men only, who may in an orderly manner make the necessary enquiries concerning the vessel and her cargo; and it is agreed that effectual provision shall be made for punishing violations of any part of this article.  
  
  
Art IV   Same.  
Art IV   Contraband of war shall consist of the following articles only; Salt Petre[,] Sulphur, Cuirasses, pikes, swords, sword belts, knapsacks, saddles and bridles, cannons, Mortars, Fire arms, Pistols, Bombs, Grenades, Balls, Bullets, firelocks, flints, Matches and Gun powder; excepting however, the quantity of the said articles which may be necessary for the defence or use of the ship, and those who compose the crew; and no other articles whatever not here enumerated, shall be reputed contraband, or liable to confiscation, but shall pass freely without being subjected to the smallest difficulty, unless they be enemys property; and it is to be particularly understood that under the denomination of enemy’s property, is not to be comprized the merchandize of the growth produce or manufactures of the countries or dominions at war which shall have been acquired by the citizens or subjects of the neutral power, and shall be transported for their account, which merchandize cannot in any case, or on any pretext be excepted from the freedom of the neutral flag.  
  
  
Art V   Same.  
Art V   In all cases where the prize Courts of either party shall pronounce judgment against any vessel or property claimed by citizens or subjects of the other, the sentence or decree shall mention the reasons or motives on which the same shall have been founded, and an authenticated copy of the sentence or decree and of all the proceedings in the case, shall, if demanded be delivered to the Commander or Agent of the said vessel without any delay, he paying the legal fees for the same.  
  
  
Art VI   Same  
Art VI   In order to determine what characterizes a blockaded port, that denomination is given only to a port where there is by the dispositions of the power which attacks it with ships stationary or sufficiently near an evident danger in entering.  
  
  
Art VII   Omit the preamble.  
Art VII   (In consideration of the distance of the ports likely to be blockaded by either party from the ports of the other party, and of other circumstances incident to their relative situation) it is agreed that no vessel sailing from the ports of either, shall altho’ cleared or bound to a blockaded port, be considered as violating in any manner the blockade, unless on her approach towards such port, she shall have been previously warned against entering the same.  
  
  
Art VIII   Omit “Captains, officers”  
Art VIII   It is agreed that no refuge or protection shall be afforded by either party to the (Captains officers) mariners, sailors or other persons not found to be its own Citizens or subjects, who shall desert from a vessel of the other party, of the crew whereof the deserter made a part; but on the contrary all such deserters shall be delivered up on demand to the commanders of the vessels from which they shall have deserted, or to the commanding officers of the ships of war of the respective nations, or to such other persons as may be duly authorized to make requisition in that behalf; provided that proof be made within two years from the time of desertion, by an exhibition of the ships papers, or authenticated copies thereof, and by satisfactory evidence of the identity of the person, that the deserters so demanded were actually part of the crew of the vessels in question.  
  
  
  
And for the more effectual execution of this article adequate provision shall be made for causing to be arrested, on the application of the respective Consuls or vice Consuls to the competent authorities, all deserters as aforesaid, duly proved to be such, in order tha⟨t⟩ they may be sent back to the Commanders of the vessels to which they belonged, or removed out of the Country, and all due aid and assistance shall be given in searching for, as well as in seizing and arresting the said deserters, who shall even be detained and kept in the prisons of the Country at the request and expence of the said Consuls or vice Consuls, until they shall have found an opportunity of sending them back or removing them as aforesaid.

Art X   It is however understood that no stipulation herein made shall be construed to empower the Civil or Military officers of either of the parties, to enter forcibly into any of the forts, Garrisons posts or other places, or to use violence of any sort, within the jurisdiction of the other party; or be construed in any manner to contravene or derogate from the prohibition contained in the first of the above articles against demanding or taking persons out of vessels on the high seas, and without the jurisdiction of either of the parties.  
  
  
  
Art XI   Each party will prohibit its citizens or subjects, from clandestinely carrying away from the territories or dominions of the other any seaman or Soldier belonging to such other party.  
  
  
  
Art XII   Neither party shall permit any of the articles above enumerated as contraband of war, to be cleared out from its ports, to any place within the jurisdiction of an enemy of the other party, and in order to enforce this regulation, due proof and security shall be required that all such articles of contraband as may be exported from the ports of either of the parties, have been actually deliverd elsewhere, than within the jurisdiction of an enemy of the other party.  
  
  
  
Art XIII   This convention shall be in force for the term of five years from the date of the exchange of ratifications. It shall be ratified on both sides within 3 months from the date of its signature or sooner if possible; and the ratifications exchanged without delay in the United States at the City of Washington.  
  
  
  
Observations on the preceding plan.  
The first article relates to impressments from american vessels on the high seas. The Commanders of British armed vessels, have, as is well known, been long in this practice. They have indeed not only continued it, under the sanction of their superiors, on the high seas, but have with impunity, extended it to our own coasts, to neutral ports, even to neutral territory, and in some instances, to our own harbours. The article does not comprehend these latter cases, because it would not be very honorable in Great Britain to stipulate against the practice of such enormities, nor in the United States, to recur to stipulations, as a security against it; and because it may be presumed that such particular enormities will not be repeated or unpunished, after a general stop shall have been put to impressments.  
The article, in its first form, renounces the claim to take from the vessel of the neutral party, on the high seas any person whatever not in the military service of an enemy; an exception which we admit to come within the law of nations, on the subject of contraband of war.  
With this exception, we consider a neutral flag on the high seas as a safeguard to those sailing under it. Great Britain on the contrary asserts a right to search for and seize her own subjects; and under that cover, as cannot but happen, are often seized and taken off, citizens of the United States and citizens or subjects of other neutral countries, navigating the high seas, under the protection of the American flag.  
Were the right of Great Britain, in this case, not denied, the abuses flowing from it, would justify the United States in claiming and expecting a discontinuance of its exercise. But the right is denied, and on the best grounds.  
Altho’ Great Britain has not yet adopted in the same latitude with most other nations, the immunities of a neutral flag, she will not deny the general freedom of the high seas, and of neutral vessels navigating them, with such exceptions only as are annexed to it by the law of nations. She must produce then such an exception in the law of nations in favor of the right she contends for. But in what written and received authority will she find it? In what usage except her own, will it be found? She will find in both, that a neutral vessel does not protect certain objects denominated contraband of war, including enemies, serving in the war nor articles going into a blockaded port, nor as she has maintained, and as we have not contested, enemy’s property of any kind. But no where will she find an exception to this freedom of the seas, and of neutral flags, which justifies the taking away of any person not an enemy in military service, found on board a neutral vessel.  
If treaties, British as well as others, are to be consulted on this subject, it will equally appear that no countenance to the practice can be found in them. Whilst they admit a contraband of war, by enumerating its articles, and the effect of a real blockade by defining it; in no instance do they affirm or imply a right in any sovereign to enforce his claims to the allegiance of his subjects, on board neutral vessels on the high seas. On the contrary, whenever a belligerent claim against persons on board a neutral vessel, is referred to in treaties, enemies in military service alone are excepted from the general immunity of persons in that situation; and this exception confirms the immunity of those who are not included in it.  
It is not then from the law or the usage of nations, nor from the tenor of treaties, that any sanction can be derived for the practice in question. And surely it will not be pretended that the Sovereignty of any nation extends, in any case whatever, beyond its own dominions, and its own vessels on the high seas. Such a doctrine would give just alarm to all nations, and more than any thing, would countenance the imputation of aspiring to an universal empire of the seas. It would be the less admissible too, as it would be applicable to times of peace as well as to times of war, and to property as well as to persons. If the law of allegiance, which is a municipal law, be in force at all on the high seas, on board foreign vessels it must be so at all times there, as it is within its acknowledged sphere. If the reason alledged for it be good in time of war, namely that the sovereign has then a right to the service of all his subjects, it must be good at all times, because at all times he has the same right to their service. War is not the only occasion for which he may want their services; nor is external danger, the only danger against which their service may be required for his security. Again; if the authority of a municipal law can operate on persons in foreign vessels on the high seas, because within the dominion of their sovereign, they would be subject to that law, and are violating that law by being in that situation, how reject the inference, that the authority of a municipal law may equally be enforced on board foreign vessels on the high seas, against articles of property exported in violation of such a law; or belonging to the country from which it was exported? And thus every commercial regulation in time of peace too, as well as of war, would be made obligatory on foreigners and their vessels, not only whilst within the dominion of the sovereign making the regulation, but in every sea, and at every distance, where an armed vessel might meet with them. Another inference deserves attention. If the subjects of one sovereign may be taken by force from the vessels of another, on the high seas, the right of taking them when found implies the right of searching for them; a vexation of commerce, especially in time of peace, which has not yet been attempted, and which for that as well as other reasons, may be regarded as contradicting the principle, from which it would flow.  
Taking reason and justice for the tests of this practice it is peculiarly indefensible; because it deprives, the dearest rights of persons, of a regular trial, to which the most inconsiderable article of property captured on the high seas, is entitled; and leaves their destiny to the will of an officer, sometimes cruel, often ignorant, and generally interested, by his want of mariners, in his own decisions. Whenever property found in a neutral vessel is supposed to be liable on any grounds to capture and condemnation, the rule in all cases is that the question shall not be decided by the captor, but be carried before a legal tribunal, where a regular trial may be had, and where the captor himself is liable to damages, for an abuse of his power. Can it be reasonable then or just, that a belligerent commander who is thus restricted and thus responsible in a case of mere property of trivial amount, should be permitted, without recurring to any tribunal whatever, to examine the crew of a neutral vessel, to decide the important question of their respective allegiances, and to carry that decision into instant execution, by forcing every individual he may chuse, into a service abhorent to his feelings, cutting him off from his most tender connections, exposing his mind and his person to the most humiliating discipline, and his life itself to the greatest dangers. Reason, justice and humanity unite in protesting against so extravagant a proceeding. And what is the pretext for it? It is that the similarity of language and of features between american citizens and British subjects are such as not easily to be distinguished; and that without this arbitrary and summary authority to make the distinction, British subjects would escape, under the name of american citizens from the duty which they owe to their Sovereign. Is then the difficulty of distinguishing a mariner of one country from the mariner of the other, and the importance of his services, a good plea for referring the question, whether he belongs to the one or to the other, to an arbitrary decision on the spot, by an interested and unresponsible officer? In all other cases, the difficulty and the importance of questions, are considered as reasons for requiring greater care and formality in investigating them, and greater security for a right decision on them. To say that precautions of this sort are incompatible with the object, is to admit that the object is unjustifiable; since the only means by which it can be pursued are such as cannot be justified.  
The evil takes a deeper die when viewed in its practice as well as its principles. Were it allowable that British subjects should be taken out of american vessels on the high seas, it might at least be required that the proof of their allegiance should lie on the British side. This obvious and just rule is however reversed; and every seaman on board, tho’ going from an american port, and sailing under the american flag, and sometimes even speaking an idiom proving him not to be a british subject, is presumed to be such, unless shewn to be an american citizen. It may safely be affirmed that this is an outrage and an indignity, which has no precedent, and which Great Britain would be among the last nations in the world to suffer if offered to her own subjects, and her own flag. Nor is it always against the right presumption alone, which is in favor of the citizenship corresponding with the flag, that the violence is committed. Not unfrequently it takes place in defiance of the most positive proof, certified in due form by an american officer. Let it not be said, that in granting to american seamen this protection for their rights as such, the point is yielded, that the proof lies on the american side; and that the want of it in the prescribed form, justifies the inference that the seaman is not of american allegiance. It is distinctly to be understood that the certificate usually called a protection to american seamen, is not meant to protect them under their own or even any other neutral flag on the high seas. We maintain, and can never admit, that in such a situation any other protection is required for them, than the neutral flag itself, on the high seas. The document is given to prove their real character, in situations, to which neither the law of nations, nor the laws of their own Country are applicable; in other words to protect them within the jurisdiction of the British laws, and to secure to them, within every other jurisdiction, the rights and immunities due to them. If in the course of their navigation even on the high seas, the document should have the effect of repelling wrongs of any sort, it is an incidental advantage only, of which they avail themselves, and is by no means to be misconstrued into a right to exact such a proof, or to make any disadvantageous inference from the want of it.  
Were it even admitted that certificates for protection might be justly required in time of war from american seamen, they could only be required in cases, where the lapse of time from its commencement had given an opportunity for the American seamen to provide themselves with such a document. Yet it is certain that in a variety of instances, seamen have been impressed from american vessels, on the plea that they had not this proof of citizenship, when the dates and places of the impressments, demonstrated the impossibility of their knowing, in time to provide the proof, that a state of war had rendered it necessary.  
Whether therefore, we consult the law of nations, the tenor of treaties or the dictates of reason and justice, no warrant, no pretext can be found for the British practice of making impressments from american vessels on the high seas.  
Great Britain has the less to say in excuse for this practice, as it is in direct contradiction to the principle on which she proceeds in other cases. Whilst she claims and seizes on the high seas, her own subjects voluntarily serving in American vessels, she has constantly given; when she could give, as a reason for not discharging from her service american citizens, that they had voluntarily engaged in it. Nay, more; whilst she impresses her own subjects from the american service, altho’ they may have been settled and married, and even naturalized in the United States, she constantly refuses to release from hers, american citizens impressed into it, whenever she can give for a reason that they were either settled or married within her Dominions. Thus, when the voluntary consent of the individual, favors her pretensions, she pleads the validity of that consent. When the voluntary consent of the individual stands in the way of her pretensions, it goes for nothing! When marriage or residence can be pleaded in her favor, she avails herself of the plea. When marriage and residence, and even naturalization are against her, no respect whatever is paid to either! She takes by force her own Subjects voluntarily serving in our Vessels—She keeps by force American Citizens involuntarily serving in hers. More flagrant inconsistencies cannot be imagined.  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives which ought to be felt by the British Government to relinquish a practice which exposes it to so many reproaches; it is foreseen that objections of different sorts will be pressed on you. You will be told first, of the great number of British Seamen in the American Trade and of the necessity for their services in time of War and Danger. 2. of the right and the prejudice of the British nation with respect to what are called the British or narrow Seas, where its domain would be abandoned by the general stipulation required. 3. Of the use which would be made of such a Sanctuary as that of American Vessels, for desertions and traiterous communications to her enemies, especially across the Channel to France.  
1. With respect to the British Seamen serving in our Trade, it may be remarked first, that the number tho’ considerable, is probably less than may be supposed; secondly, that what is wrong in itself, can not be made right by considerations of expediency or advantage; thirdly, that it is proved by the fact, that the number of real British Subjects gained by the practice in question, is of inconsiderable importance even in the scale of advantage. The annexed report to Congress on the subject of impressments with the addition of such cases as may be in the hands of Mr. Irving will verify the remark in its application to the present War. The statement made by his Predecessor during the last War, and which is also annexed, is in the same view still more conclusive. The statement comprehends not only all the applications made by him in the first instance, for the liberation of impressed Seamen, between the Month of June 1797, and Septr. 1801, but many also which had been made previous to his Agency by Mr. Pinckney and Mr. King, and which it was necessary for him to renew. These applications therefore may fairly be considered as embracing the greater part of the period of the War; and as applications are known to have been pretty indiscriminately made, they may be further considered as embracing if not the whole, the far greater part of the impressments, those of British Subjects, as well as others. Yet the result exhibits 2.059 cases only; &amp; of this number, 102 Seamen only “detained as being British Subjects,” which is less than 1/20 of the number impressed; and 1142 discharged or ordered to be so, as not being British Subjects, which is more than half of the whole number; leaving 805 for further proof, with the strongest presumption, that the greater part if not the whole were Americans or other Aliens, whose proof of Citizenship had been lost or destroyed, or whose situation would account for the difficulties and delays in producing it. So that, it is certain, that for all the British Seamen gained by this violent proceeding, more than an equal number who were not so were the victims; it is highly probable that for every British Seaman so gained, a number of others not less than 10 for 1 must have been the victims; and it is even possible that this number may have exceeded the proportion of twenty to one.  
It cannot therefore be doubted that the acquisition of British Seamen, by these impressments, whatever may be its advantage, is lost in the wrong done to Americans ignorantly or wilfully mistaken for British Subjects; in the jealousy and ill will excited among all maritime nations by an adherence to such a practice; and in the particular provocation to measures of redress on the part of the U. States, not less disagreeable to them, than embarrassing to G. Britain, and which may threaten the good understanding which ought to be faithfully cultivated by both. The copy of a bill brought into Congress, under the influence of violations committed on our flag, gives force to this latter consideration. Whether it will pass into a law, and at the present Session, is more than can yet be said. As there is every reason to believe, that it has been proposed with reluctance, it will possibly not be pursued into effect, if any hope can be supported of a remedy by an amicable arrangement between the two nations. But such is the feeling thro’ this Country produced by the reiterated and atrocious cases of impressment and other insults on our flag, that a remedy of some kind will ere long be called for in a tone not to be disregarded. A copy of the bill referred to is herewith enclosed.  
There is a further consideration which ought to have weight in this question. Altho’ the British Seamen, employed in carrying on American commerce, be in some respects lost to their own nation, yet such is the intimate and extensive connextion of this Commerce, direct and circuitous, with the Commerce, the manufactures, the Revenue and the general resources of the British nation, that in other respects its mariners, on board American Vessels, may truly be said to be rendering it the most valuable services. It would not be extravagant to make it a question, whether Great Britain would not suffer more by withdrawing her Seamen from the merchant Vessels of the United States, than her enemies would suffer from the addition of them to the crews of her ships of war and cruizers.  
Should any difficulty be started concerning seamen born within the British dominions, and naturalized by the UStates since the Treaty of 1783, you may remove it by observing; first that very few of any such naturalizations can take place; the law here requiring a preparatory residence of five years with notice of the intention to become a citizen entered of record two years before the last necessary formality; besides a regular proof of good moral character; conditions little likely to be complied with by ordinary sea faring persons: secondly, that a discontinuance of impressments on the high seas will preclude an actual collision between the interfering claims. Within the jurisdiction of each nation, and in their respective vessels on the high seas, each will enforce the allegiance which it claims. In other situations the individuals doubly claimed will be within a jurisdiction independent of both nations.  
2d The British pretentions to domain over the narrow seas are so obsolete, and so indefensible, that they never would have occurred as a probable objection in this case if they had not actually frustrated an arrangement settled by Mr. King with the British Ministry on the subject of impressments from American Vessels on the high seas. At the moment when the articles were expected to be signed, an exception of the “narrow Seas,” was urged and insisted on by Ld. St. Vincent; &amp; being utterly inadmissible on our part, the negotiation was abandoned. Mr. King, seems to be of opinion however that with more time, than was left him for the experiment, the objection might have been overcome. This is not improbable if the objection was not merely an expedient for evading a relinquishment of a favorite practice.  
The objection in itself has certainly not the slightest foundation. The time has been indeed when England not only claimed but exercised pretentions scarcely inferior to full sovereignty, over the Seas surrounding the British Isles, and even as far as Cape Finisterre to the South, and Vanslaten in Norway to the North. It was a time however, when reason had little share in determining the law and the intercourse of Nations, when power alone decided questions of right, and when the ignorance &amp; want of concert among other maritime Countries, facilitated such an usurpation. The progress of civilization &amp; information has produced a change in all those respects; &amp; no principle in the code of public law is at present better established than the common freedom of the Seas, beyond a very limited distance from the Territories washed by them. This distance is not indeed fixed with absolute precision. It is varied in a small degree by written authorities, and perhaps it may be reasonably varied in some degree by local peculiarities. But the greatest distance which would now be listened to any where, would make a small proportion of the narrowest part of the narrowest seas in question.  
What are in fact the prerogatives claimed and exercised by Great Britain over these seas? If they were really a part of her domain, her authority would be the same there as within her other domain. Foreign vessels would be subject to all the laws and regulations framed for them, as much as if they were within the harbours or rivers of the Country. Nothing of this sort is pretended. Nothing of this sort would be tolerated. The only instances in which these seas are distinguished from other seas, or in which Great Britain enjoys within them, any distinction over other nations, are, first, the compliment paid by other flags to hers; secondly, the extension of her territorial jurisdiction in certain cases to the distance of four leagues from the coast. The first is a relic of ancient usurpation, which has thus long escaped the correction which modern and more enlightened times have applied to other usurpations. The prerogative has been often contested however, even at the expence of bloody wars; and is still borne with ill will and impatience by her neighbors. At the last Treaty of peace at Amiens, the abolition of it was repeatedly and strongly pressed by France; and it is not improbable that at no remote day it will follow the fate of the title of “King of France,” so long worn by the British Monarchs and at length so properly sacrificed to the lessons of a magnanimous wisdom. As far as this homage to the British flag has any foundation at present, it rests merely on long usage and long acquiescence; which are construed, as in a few other cases of maritime claims, into the effect of a general tho’ tacit convention. The second instance is the extension of the territorial jurisdiction to four leagues from the shore. This too, as far as the distance may exceed that which is generally allowed, rests on a like foundation; strengthened perhaps, by the local facility of smuggling, and the peculiar interest which Great Britain has in preventing a practice affecting so deeply her whole system of revenue, commerce, and manufactures: whilst the limitation itself to four leagues, necessarily implies that beyond that distance no territorial jurisdiction is assumed.  
But whatever may be the origin or the value of these prerogatives over foreign flags in one case and within a limitted portion of these seas in another; it is obvious, that neither of them will be violated by the exemption of american vessels from impressments which are nowise connected with either; having never been made on the pretext either of withholding the wanted homage to the British flag or of smuggling in defiance of British laws.  
This extension of the British law to four leagues from the shore is inferred from an act of Parliament passed in the year 1736 (9 g. 2 C. 35) the terms of which comprehend all vessels, foreign as well as British. It is possible however, that the former are constructively excepted. Should your enquiries ascertain this to be the case, you will find yourself on better ground, than the concession here made.  
With respect to the compliment paid to the British flag, it is also possible that more is here conceded, than you may find to be necessary. After the peace of 1783, this compliment was peremptorily withheld by France in spite of the remonstrances of Great Britain, and it remains for your enquiry, whether it did not continue to be refused, notwithstanding the failure at Amiens to obtain from G Britain a formal renunciation of the claim.  
From every view of the subject, it is reasonable to expect that the exception of the narrow seas from the stipulation against impressments, will not be inflexibly maintained. Should it be so, your negotiation will be at an end. The truth is that so great a proportion of our trade direct and circuitous passes thro’ those channels, and such is its peculiar exposure in them to the wrong practised, that with such an exception any remedy would be very partial. And we can never consent to purchase a partial remedy by confirming a general evil, and by subjecting ourselves to our own reproaches, as well as to those of other nations.  
3. It appears, as well by a letter from Mr. Thornton, in answer to one from me, of both which copies are herewith inclosed, as from conversations with Mr. Merry that the facility which would be given, particularly in the British channel by the immunity claimed for American vessels, to the escape of traitors, and the desertion of others whose services in time of War may be particularly important to an enemy, forms one of the pleas for the British practice of examining american crews, and will be one of the objections to a formal relinquishment of it.  
This plea, like all others, admits a solid and satisfactory reply. In the first place, if it could prevail at all against the neutral claim, it would authorize the seizure of the persons described only, and in vessels bound to a hostile country only; whereas the practice of impressing is applied to persons, few or any of whom are alledged to be of either description, and to vessels whithersoever bound, even to G. Britain herself. In the next place, it is not only a preference of a smaller object on one side, to a greater object on the other; but a sacrifice of right on one side to expediency on the other side.  
Considering, nevertheless, the possible adherence of the British Government to this last objection, and the extreme importance to our seafaring citizens and commerce, of a stipulation suppressing a practice, flagrant in its nature, and still more so in the abuses inseparable from it, you are left at liberty to concur if necessary, in the modification as it stands in the Second column. You will observe that this guards in all cases the crews of our vessels from being meddled with; and in referring for an exception to the immunity on board our vessels, to the law of nations, yields no principle maintained by the United States; inasmuch as the referrence will be satisfied by the acknowledged exception of enemies in military service. Should persons therefore, other than such, be taken, under pretext of the law of nations, the United States will be free to contest the proceeding; and there is the less difficulty in leaving the stipulation on this footing, as the case may never happen, and will be pretty sure to happen but rarely. You will observe also, that in the passage from one port to another of the respective countries, the vessels of the neutral parties are to protect all persons without exception. Independently of the general principle asserted by the United States, this respect is due to the peculiar character of the coasting trade, and the utter improbability that it will at any time be a vehicle to persons of any obnoxious description.  
  
  
On Article II.  
The reasonableness of this article is manifest. Citizens or Subjects of one country residing in another, though bound by their temporary allegiance to many common duties, can never be rightfully forced into military service, particularly external service; nor be restrained from leaving their residence when they please. The law of nations protects them against both; and the violation of this law, by the avowed impressment of american citizens residing in Great Britain, may be pressed with the greater force on the British Government, as it is in direct inconsistency with her impressment of her own subjects bound by much stronger ties to the United States as above explained; as well as with the spirit of her commercial laws and policy, by which foreigners are invited to a residence. The liberation of the persons comprehended by this article, therefore, cannot be justly or honorably refused, and the provision for their recompence and their return home, is equally due to the service rendered by, and the wrong done to, them.  
  
  
On Article III.  
This regulation is conformable to the law of nations, and to the tenor of all treaties which define the belligerent claim of visiting and searching neutral vessels. No treaty can be cited in which the practice of compelling the neutral vessel to send its boat, its officers, its people or its papers to the belligerent vessel, is authorized. British Treaties, as well as those to which she is not a party, in every instance, where a regulation of the claim is undertaken, coincide with the article here proposed. The article is in fact almost a transcript of the XXVI article of the Treaty of 1786 between G.Britain and France.  
The regulation is founded in the best reasons—1st. It is sufficient for the neutral, that he acquiesces in the interruption of his voyage, and the trouble of the examination, imposed by the belligerent commander. To require a positive and active co-operation on his part in behalf of the latter, is more than can be justified on any principle—2d. The belligerent party can always send more conveniently to the neutral vessel, than this can send to the belligerent vessel; having neither such fit boats for the purpose, especially in a rough sea, nor being so abundantly manned. 3d. This last consideration is enforced by the numerous and cruel abuses committed in the practice of requiring the neutral vessel to send to the belligerent. As an example you will find in the documents now transmitted a case where neither the smallness and leakiness of the boat, nor the boisterous state of the weather, nor the pathetic remonstrances of the neutral commander had any effect on the imperious injunctions of the belligerent, and where the task was performed at the manifest peril of the boat, the papers, and the lives of the people. The limitation of the number to be sent on board the neutral vessel is a reasonable and usual precaution against the danger of insults and pillage.  
  
  
On Art: IV.  
This enumeration of contraband articles is copied from the Treaty of 1781 between Great Britain and Russia. It is sufficiently limitted; and that Treaty is an authority more likely than any other to be respected by the British Government. The sequel of the article, which protects the productions of a hostile Colony, converted into neutral property, is taken from the same model, with the addition of the terms “in any case or on any pretext.” This addition is meant to embrace more explicitly, our right to trade freely with the Colonies at war with Great Britain, and between them and all parts of the world in Colonial productions, being at the time not enemy’s, but neutral property: a trade equally legitimate in itself with that between neutral countries directly &amp; in their respective vessels, and such Colonies; which the British regulations do not contest.  
In support of this right, in opposition to the British doctrine, that a trade not allowed by a nation in time of peace cannot be opened to neutrals in time of war, it may be urged, that all nations are in the practice of varying more or less in time of war their commercial laws, from the state of these laws in time of peace, a practice agreeable to reason, as well as favorable to neutral nations; that the change may be made in time of war, on considerations not incident to a state of war, but on such as are known to have the same effect in time of peace; that G. Britain herself is in the regular practice, of changing her navigation and commercial laws, in times of war, particularly in relation to a neutral intercourse with her Colonies; that at this time she admits a trade between neutral countries and the Colonies of her enemies, when carried on directly between them, or between the former and herself; interrupting only a direct trade between such Colonies and their parent state; and between them and Countries in Europe, other than those to which the neutral trade may respectively belong; that as she does not contest the right of neutrals to trade with hostile colonies, within these limitations, the trade can be, and actually is carried on indirectly between such colonies and all Countries, even those to which the Colonies belong; and consequently that the effect of her doctrine and her practice, is not to deprive her enemy of their Colonial trade, but merely to lessen the value of it in proportion to the charges incident to the circuitous course into which it is forced; an advantage to her which if just in itself, would not be sufficiently so, to balance the impolitic vexations accruing to neutral and friendly nations.  
These views of the subject have entered into my conversations with Mr. Merry. He expresses, notwithstanding, a belief that Great Britain will turn an unfavorable ear to any proposition calculated to give her enemies the resources of their Colonial Trade, beyond the degree in which her present regulations permit. This is doubtless to be apprehended; but considering the proposition as an article which may find a balance in the general bargain, it may not be inadmissible; or if inadmissible in the extent proposed, a middle ground may perhaps be accepted. The Colonial Trade in question consists of four branches; first between the Colonies and Great Britain herself, Secondly, between the Colonies and the neutral Countries carrying on the Trade; thirdly, between the Colonies and neutral Countries not themselves carrying on the Trade; fourthly, between the Colonies and the Countries to which they belong or which are parties to the War with Great Britain.  
The first and second branches are those with which her own regulations accord. The last is that to which her aversion will of course be the strongest. Should this aversion be unconquerable, let it be tried then, and then only, whether on our yielding or rather omitting that point, she will not yield to us in return the direct Trade between hostile Colonies and neutral Countries generally. You will be careful however so to modify the compromise as will mark as little as may be, a positive relinquishment of the direct Trade between the belligerent nations and their Colonies.  
Should such a compromise be altogether rejected, you will limit the article, to the simple enumeration of contraband; it being desireable that without a very valuable consideration, no precedent should be given by the United States of a stipulated acknowledgement that free Ships do not make free goods. And you will omit the article altogether, if a proper list of contraband, cannot be agreed on, particularly, one that excludes money, provisions and naval Stores.  
  
  
On Art V.  
This article is taken from the Convention of 1800 between the United States and France, is conformable to the general practice of the prize Courts in the latter, and is the more worthy of adoption every where, as it would contribute so much to the consistency and stability of the rules of Admiralty proceedings. Without a single objection justly lying against it, it will have the important advantages, of being a check on the inferior tribunals, of enabling the superior tribunal where a faulty reason appears on the face of the sentence, to correct the wrong without delay or expence, and of being a check moreover on the decisions of the superior tribunal itself. As prize causes also are tried by Courts not of a third party, but of one of the parties interested, it is but reasonable that the ground should be known to the other on which judgment has passed against its citizen or subject; in order, if deemed proper, that negotiations may be employed for redressing past or guarding against future injustice.  
  
  
On Art. VI  
The fictitious blockades proclaimed by Great Britain and made the pretext for violating the Commerce of neutral nations, has been one of the greatest abuses ever committed on the high Seas. During the late War they were carried to an extravagance which would have been ridiculous, if in their effects they had not inflicted such serious and extensive injuries on neutral nations. Ports were proclaimed in a state of blockade, previous to the arrival of any force at them; were continued in that state without regard to intermissions in the presence of the blockading force; and the proclamations left in operation, after its final departure: The British Cruisers during the whole time seizing every Vessel bound to such Ports, at whatever distance from them, and the British prize Courts pronouncing condemnations wherever a knowledge of the proclamation at the time of sailing could be presumed, altho’ it might afterwards be known that no real blockade existed. The whole scene was a perfect mockery, in which fact was sacri[fi]ced to forms, and right to power and plunder. The United States were among the greatest sufferers; and would have been still more so, if redress for some of the spoliations proceeding from this source, had not fallen within the provisions of an Article in the Treaty of 1794.  
From the effect of this and other arbitrary practices of Great Britain, on the temper and policy of neutral nations towards her; from the spirit of her Treaty made near the close of the late War with Russia; from the general disposition manifested at the beginning of the present, towards the United States, and the comparative moderation observed in Europe with respect to blockades (if indeed the two cases of the Weser and Elbe are not to be excepted) it was hoped that the mockeries and mischiefs practised under the name of blockades, would no where be repeated. It is found however that the West Indies are again the Theatre of them. The three entire and extensive Islands of Martinique, Guadaloupe &amp; St. Domingo have been published as in a state of blockade, altho’ the whole naval force applied to the purpose is inconsiderable; altho’ it appears that a part of this inconsiderable force is occasionally seen at the distance of many leagues at sea; altho’ it does not appear that more than one or two ports at most, have at any time been actually blockaded, and altho’ complaints are heard; that the British Ships of War do not protect their own trade against the numerous Cruisers from the Islands under this pretended blockade.  
  
Inclosed herewith are three letters on this subject; two from me, the first to Mr. Thornton, the second to Mr. Merry; and the third from Mr. Merry to me. You will observe that he does not pretend to justify the measures pursued in the West Indies, but on the contrary, wishes them to be regarded as proceeding from an Officer, who does not pursue the intentions of his Government. Still such measures prove that no general regulations or orders have been yet issued by that Government against the evil, as might reasonably have been expected; and that a stipulated security against it, is an object as important as it is just.  
In the two letters to Mr. Thornton and Mr. Merry, the ground is marked out on which you will be able to combat the false blockades, and to maintain the definition of a real one, contained in the proposed Article, which is a literal copy from the 4th. Art. of the Russian Treaty above cited. In addition to these letters, you will find inclosed a letter of the  of  to Mr. Pinckney, in which some views are taken of the subject, which may also be of use in your discussions with the British Government.  
  
  
On Art. VII  
This article is due, if not to all neutrals, at least to the United States, who are distinguished by the distance of their situation. Decisions of the British Court of Admiralty, have so far respected this peculiarity as to admit a want of information as a plea for going to a blockaded Port, where such a plea would be refused to less remote Countries. But more than this may fairly be claimed. A vessel, knowing that a particular blockade existed two Months before, may well conjecture that before her arrival at the Port, which will require two months more, the blockade will have ceased; and may accordingly clear &amp; steer for such a Port, with an honest intention, in case of finding on her approach, the fact otherwise, not to attempt an unlawful entrance. To condemn vessels under such circumstances would be manifestly unjust; and to restrain them from a distant voyage to a port once in a State of Blockade, until information of a change, shall have travelled a like distance, must produce a delay and uncertainty, little short of an absolute prohibition of the Commerce. To require them even to go out of their course, to seek at other ports information on the subject, would be an unreasonable imposition. The British Government can have little objection to this Article, after defining blockades as is agreed with Russia and as is here proposed; since our distance is of itself, a security against any concert with the blockaded, for surreptitious entries, which might be attempted by nearer adventurers; and since in the case of blockades by a force actually present, a preliminary notice may be required without impairing their efficacy, as might be the case with blockades such as the preceding article guards against.  
The only difference between the articles as standing in the different columns, consists in the preamble to that which is to be admitted, if the proposition of the other, should not succeed. The article is preferable without the recital of any reason particular to the United States; because as a naked stipulation, it strengthens instead of weakening a general principle friendly to neutral and pacific Nations.  
  
  
On Art. VIII and IX. &amp; X.  
These are articles which are known to have been long wished and contemplated on the part of Great Britain, and together with the justice and in many views the expediency to Great Britain herself, of the articles desired on our part, may induce her to accede to the whole. The articles are in substance the same with a project offered to the American Administration in the year 1800 by Mr. Liston, who appears to have borrowed it from corresponding stipulations in the Convention between the United States and France in the year . The project was at that time dropped, owing perhaps in part to the change in the head of the Department of State, between whom and Mr Liston it had been discussed; and principally, to the difficulty of combining with it proper stipulations against British impressments on the high seas. Without such an equivalent, the project had little to recommend it to the United States. Considered by itself it was too the less admissible as one of its articles, under some obscurity of expression, was thought to favor the British pretension to impress British seamen from american vessels on the high seas.  
A copy of this document is inclosed, as it may be not without use in shewing the ideas of the British Government at that time; so far at least as its minister here was an organ of them.  
The terms in which these articles are to be proposed, differ but slightly from those in which they may be admitted. In the former the delivery of deserters is confined to soldiers and seamen, without requiring a delivery of Officers, whose desertion will not be from the service of their Country, but on account of Offences, for which it might sometimes be more agreeable to the United States to be unbound to give them up for trial and punishment. At the same time this consideration ought not to be a bar to an arrangement, which in its general character will be so important to the interests of the United States.  
  
  
On Art XI.  
This is a stipulation which is not to be yielded but in the event of its being made an indispensable condition. It cannot be essential for the object of it, whilst the British Government is left free to take the precautions allowable within its own jurisdiction for preventing the clandestine departure of its seamen or its soldiers in neutral vessels. And it is very ineligible to the United States; inasmuch as it will be difficult to enforce the prohibition, whether we regard the embarkation of such persons in British ports, or their landing on the american shores; and inasmuch as the inefficacy of regulations for such purposes, tho’ made with due sincerity and care, may become a source of secret jealousy and dissatisfaction, if not of controversy and reproach.  
The article is copied from that in the arrangement (of which you have a copy) discussed and brought near to a conclusion between Mr King and the British Ministry; and you are authorized to accede to it, on the supposition, that it may again be insisted on. It is to be recollected however, that the article was then understood to be the only price given for relinquishing the impressment of American seamen. The other offers now substituted, will justify you in pressing the omission of the original one.  
  
  
On Art XII  
The law of nations does not exact of neutral powers the prohibition specified in this article. On the other hand it does not restrain them from prohibiting a trade which appears on the face of the official papers proceeding from the Custom House, to be intended to violate the law of nations, and from which legitimate considerations of prudence may also dissuade a Government. All that can be reasonably expected by belligerent from neutral powers, is that their regulations on this subject be impartial; and that their stipulations relative to it, when made in time of war at least, should not preclude an impartiality.  
It is not certain what degree of value GBritain may put on this article, connected as it essentially is with the article which limits the list of contraband. It will at least mitigate her objection to such a limitation. With the range given to contraband by her construction of the law of nations, even as acquiesced in by the United States, a stipulation of this sort would be utterly inadmissible.  
The last article, in making this city, the place for exchanging the ratifications, consults expedition in putting the Treaty into operation, since the British ratification can be forwarded at the same [sic] with the instrument itself. And it is otherwise reasonable that as the negotiation and formation of the Treaty will have taken place at the seat of the British Government, the concluding formality should be at that of the Government of the U States.  
In addition to these articles, which with the observations thereon, I am charged by the President to communicate to you as his instructions, he leaves you at liberty to insert any others which may do no more than place British armed vessels with their prizes on an equality within our ports and jurisdiction with those of France. This would only stipulate what would probably be done by gratuitous regulations here, and as it would no doubt be acceptable to GBritain, it may not only aid in reconciling her to the principal objects desired by the U States, but may induce her to concur in the further insertion of articles, corresponding with those in the Convention of 1800 with France, which regulate more precisely and more effectually the treatment of vessels of the neutral party on the high seas.  
The occasion will be proper also, for calling the attention of the British Government to the reasonableness of permitting american Consuls to reside in every part of her dominions, where and so long as she permits our citizens to trade. It is not denied that she has a natural right to refuse such a residence, and that she is free by her treaty with us, to refuse it in other than her European dominions. But the exception authorized with respect to the residence of Consuls elsewhere, having reference to the refusal of our trade elsewhere, the refusal of the one ought manifestly to cease with the refusal of the other. Where our vessels and Citizens are allowed to trade to ports in the West Indies, there is the same reason for a cotemporary admission of Consuls to take care of it, as there is for their admission in ports where the trade is permanently allowed. There is the juster expectation of your success on this point, as some official patronage is due to the rights of our Citizens in the prize Courts established in the West India Islands. Should the British Govt. be unwilling to enter into a stipulated provision, you may perhaps obtain an order to the Governors for the purpose. Or if Consuls be objected to altogether, it is desirable that Agents may be admitted, if no where else⟨,⟩ at least in the Islands where the Vice Admiralty Courts are established.  
It has been intimated that the articles as standing in the different columes, are to be considered, the one as the offer to be made, the other as the ultimatum to be required. This is however not to be taken too strictly; it being impossible to foresee the turns and the combinations, which may present themselves in the course of the negotiation. The essential objects for the U. States are the suppression of impressments, and the definition of Blockades. Next to these in importance, are the reduction of the list of contraband and the enlargment of our neutral trade with hostile Colonies. Whilst you keep in view therefore those objects, the two last as highly important and the two first as absolutely indispensable, your discretion in which the President places great confidence, must guide you in all that relates to the inferior ones. With Sentiments of great respect &amp; esteem I remain Sir. Yr Most Obedt. svt.

effect ofrepelling wfOngs of any sort,  
it is an incidental advantage only, of  
which they avail themselves-, and is by*  
no means to be misconstrued intoa right  
to exact su if, or to make aov  
disadvantageous interference from the  
want of it,  
Were it even admitted that ccrtifi- i  
ca&#x27;tea for protection might :.- re­  
quired in time of war, from American  
ien, they con&#x27;! only be required in  
cases where th n its  
commenc?.mci:i, n an opp-.n-ru­  
nity for the Amerh n seamen to provide  
themselves with such a document. Yet  
it i.-&gt; certain that in a variety of in  
ccs, seamen ii ive been impressed from j  
j American vessels, on th&lt;&gt; plea that they I  
: had not this proot ot citii when !  
the dates and places of the impress j  
ments demonstrated the impossibility cf ;  
their knowing, in time to provide the 1  
; proof,-t&#x27;m.t a state of war had rendered  
j it necessary.  
Whether, therefore, we consult the  
; law of nations, the tenor of treaties, or  
the dictates of reason and justice, no  
warrant, no pretext can lie found for  
; the British practice of making impress­  
-1 mentsfrpm American vessels on the  
high  
■ Great Britain has the less to say in  
&#x27; excuse for this practice, us it is in di­  
i rect conti i the principles on  
1 which she proceeds in other cases.  
I Whilst she claims and seizes on the  
high seas, her own subjects, voluntari­  
ly serving in American vessels, she has  
: constantly riven, when she could  
I as a reason for not discharging from her  
j service American citizen?, that  
&gt;j had voluntarily engaged in it. Nay,  
: more, whilst she impresses her own  
s&#x27;.iii the American service, ni­  
gh they may have been settle:&#x27;, and  
married, and even naturalised in th  
S. the constantly refuses to release from  
tier&#x27;s, American citizens impressed into  
it, whenever she can give for a reason,  
that they werceither settled or marri-  
Ithin her dominions. Tims, when  
the&#x27;voluntary consent of the individual  
favors herpretensions, she pleads the  
validity of that consent. When the vo­  
luntai &#x27;&#x27;• of the individual stands  
in the way of &quot;her pretensions, it goes  
for nothing ! When marriage or resi­  
dence can be pleaded in her favor, she  
avails&quot;herself of the plea. When mar­  
riageand residence, and even naturali­  
zation are against her, no respect  
whatever is paid to either ! She tal &lt;s ,  
by force her own subjects, voluntarily !  
serving in our vessels. She keeps  
force American citizens, invohiiit.rily  
serving in hers. More flagrant Incon­  
sistencies cannot be imagined.  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives  
which ought to be felt by the British go­  
vernment to relinquish a practice which  
exposes it to so many reproaches, it is  
foreseen that objections of different sorts  
will be pressed on you. You will be told j  
first, of the great number of British !  
seamen in the American trade, and of  
the necessity for their services in time  
of war and danger. Secondly, ot the  
right and the prejudice of the. British  
nation, with respect to what are called  
the British or narrow seas, where its  
domain would be abandoned by the gene­  
ral stipulation required. Thirdly, of ,  
the uce which would be made of such a  
sanCtrjafy as that of American vessels,  
for desertions, and traitorous communi­  
cations to her en mies, especially across  
the channel to France.  
let. With respect to the British sea­  
men serving in our trade, it may be re­  
marked, first, that the number, though  
derable, is probably less than  
be supposed. Secondly, that what is  
wrong in itself cannot be made right hy  
j considerations of expediency or advan­  
; tage. Thirdly, that it is proved by the  
fact, that the number of real British  
subjects&#x27;gained by the practice in questi­  
on, is of inconsiderable importance, even  
in the scale of advantage. The annex­  
ed report to Congress on the subject of  
impressments, with theadditi  
cases as may be in the hands of Mr.  
Erving, will verify the remark in its  
appii- the present war. Tho  
statement made by his predecessor dur­  
ing the last war, and which is also an­  
nexed, is in the same view sdil more  
conclusive. The statement compre­  
hends not only all the. applications made  
by him in tlie first instance, for the li­  
- ion of impressed seamen, uct ■  
the month of June \797, and September,  
1801, but many also whicn had been  
made previous tti his agency, by iVir.  
Pinckr.ey and Mr. King, and which it  
was necessary for him to rcn:\v. These  
applications therefore may fairly be  
: e.s embracing the gi&lt;  
part of the period of the war; ami ,ts  
ii lions, are kn v.n to be pretty in­  
discnmmatciy made, they may further  
be considered as c\.: ir icing, if net the  
whole, the far greater part of the im­  
pressments, those of British •übjei &#x27;  
well as others. Vet the: result exhibits  
2,059 cases only, and of this number 103  
seamen only, detained as being British  
subjects, which is less than 1-20 of the  
number impressed, and 1,142 discharg­  
ed or ordered to be so, as not being Bri­  
tish subjects, which is more than half  
of the whole number, leaving I(03 fei  
further proof, with the strongest pre­  
sumption that the greater part, it nol  
the whole, were Americans or other  
1 Aiicas, whose proof of citizenship had  
  
been lost or destroyed, or whose situa* j  
tion would account for the difficulties  
Hrtrl delays 1n producingit. So that rt is  
iI, that for ftrttish se mien  
gained by thi* y ceedmg, more J  
than an cqi. il number who were not so ]  
i were the victims ; . probable]  
that i Ii seamen so gam- j  
ed, :r niimii&#x27;-&#x27;- of others, less than 10 for &#x27;  
one, must have been th* victims, and if. j  
ssible that this number may I  
have exceeded the proportion of 20 to j  
on \
rt cannot therefore be doubted, that  
the acquisition of British seamen, by  
these impre«inentß, whatever may be  
! its advantage, is lost in the- wfoag done  
jto American i ■ mis­  
j taken for .&#x27;■ albo­  
id ill-will excited among at! mari­  
&#x27;&lt; time nation* by an adherence to such a  
j practice, and in the particular provoca­  
j ri&#x27;in to measures of&#x27;reriress&#x27;on the part |  
■U S.nol lessdisagreeable toth  
than embarrassing to G. Britain,  
which may threaten the good under- 1  
standing which ought to be faithfully  
cultivated by both. The copy of a bill  
brought into Congress under the i&#x27;l  
ence of violations committed on our  
nig, gives fofeetothis latter considera­  
tion. Whether it will pass into a law,  
and atthe present session, is mi  
cfin yet bf said. As there is every rea­  
son to believe that it haft been pro..  
with reluctance, it will probably not be  
pursue! into effect, if any hope can He  
orterl of a remedy, by an amicable  
arrangement between th,- twon itions.  
There is a further consideration  
to hive weight in this  
question. Although the British seamen  
oyed iii carrying on American J  
.-)&#x27;• resp cts lost to j  
their own nation, vet such is the inti- J  
mate and extensive connexion of this |  
commerce, direct and circuitous, with t  
the commerce, the manufactures, reve­  
nue, and the general resources of the  
British nation, that in other&quot; respects its  
mariner:-, on board American   
may truly b«: said to be rendering it the  
most valuable services. It would not  
be extravagant to make it a question, |  
whether Great Britain would not suf- [  
fer more by withdrawing her scan.en  
from tlie merchant vessels of tlie 11.  
S. than her eiiemies would suffer from |  
the addition of them to the crews of  
her ships of war. and cruizers.  
j Should any difficulty be started con- [  
j cerning seamen born within the British j  
&#x27; dominions, and naturalized by the U. i  
S. since the treaty of 178$, you may l  
remove it by observing.; First, that ye- j  
ry few, if any such naturalizations can I  
take place, the law here requiring a  
preparatory residence of live years,  
with, notice of the intention to become 1  
a citizen entered of record two ye  
before the last necessary formality, be­  
! sides a regular proof of good moral &#x27;  
I character, conditions little likely to lie :  
! Complied with by ordinary sea-faring  
persons. Secondly, that a disceutinu- \
anci: of impressments on the 1  
will preclude an actual collision between  
the interfering claims. Within the fu- I  
risdiction of each nation, and in their  
respective veesels on the high seas,  
I yen. will enforce the allegiance which  
jit claims irn other situations the indi­  
\ vidua!* doubly claimed, will be within  
a jurisdiction independent of both na­  
tions.  
Secondly, The British pretensions  
to domain over the narrow seas are so  
obsolete and so indefensible, that they  
never would have occurred as a proba­  
ble objection in this case, it they had  
not actually frustrated an arrangement  
settled by Mr. King with th.  
ministry on tin;subject of impressments I  
from American vessels on the high seas.  
At the moment when the articles were  
expected to be signed, an exception of  
the &quot; narrow si urged and in-  
A on by lord St. Vincent ; and br­  
ing utterly inadmissible on our part,  
the negotiation wa* abandoned.  
TII2 objection in ii i ertainly  
not the slightest foundation; The time  
has been, indeed, w fieu England not on­  
ly claimed, but exercised pretensions  
scarcely inferior to full sovereignty over  
•is surrounding ihe British isles,  
and even aafar as Cape Finistere to  
the south&gt; and Van Staten, in Norway   
to the north. It was a time, however,  
n reason had little share in deter­  
mining the law, and the intercourse of  
nations; when power alone decided  
questions of fight, and when the igno­  
rance and want of concert among i  
maritime countries facilitated such an  
usurpation. The progress of civiliza­  
tion and information h.-.s produced a  
change in all those respects,and lit prin­  
ci] le i&#x27;l lb Of public law IS at  
pi,-sent better established, than the  
common freedom ot the leal beyond*  
very limiteddistanc.e from the territories  
•ed by them. This distance is net,  
in ff.l, fixed with absolute precision, It  
is varied in a small degree by written  
authorities, and perhaps it maybe rea­  
sonably varied in some degree by local  
peculiarities. But the greatest dist­  
ance which would now be listened to a­  
i,y where, would make a small propor­  
tion of the narrowest part of tlie nar­  
rowest seas in question.  
What are, in fact, the prerogatives  
claimed and exercised by U. Britain o­  
vi&#x27;f these seas i If they were really a

Ibe the same there ?s within her n

la&#x27;sa.re distinguished from  
or in which G. Britain eu«

ment p.iid by other flags to hers,  
ron.llv, the extension or her territorial  
jurisdiction in certain Cases to the ■  
ance of four leagues from the c  
This first is a relic of auciont usurpa­  
tion, which has-thus long escaped the  
&#x27;tion, which modern «nd more  
enlightened times hive applied tool  
patioi . The prerogative has bectt  
often contested, however, even at tins  
expence of bloody wars, and is stilt  
borne with ill will and impatience by  
her neighbors. At the list treaty of  
the abolition of it was  
repeatedly and strongly pressed by  
France ; and it isnnt improbable th  
no remote day it will follow the fate of  
the title of &quot; King of France,&quot; so long  
worn by the British rrYonarcha, and at  
length so properly sacrificed to the h s­  
sonsofa magnanimous wisdom, As far  
as this homage to the British flag has a*  
ny foundation at present, it rests merely  
on loi and long acquiesci  
which (trued, as in a few &lt;■  
cases of maritime claims, into the el­  
fei iof A general though tacit c *i een­  
tlon. The second hist .nee is the &lt;  
sion of the t&lt; rritorivl jurisdiction to four  
leagues from the shore. This top, ■■.*  
is the distance may exceed

j like foundation, strengthened, perh  
jby the local facility of smut-;

) has iv preventing a practice ah&quot;  
so deeply her whole system of revenue,

the limitation itself to 4 leagues, neei

This extension,ol the British hirti  
■ four leagues from the shore, is infei red  
; from an act of parliamen n tlie  
year 1736 (9 G. 2 c. 35.) the ternis of  
which comprehend all vessels foreign  
las well as British. It is possible hpw­  
, that the former are constructively  
pted. Should your enquiries  
certain this to lie the base, you will hud  
i yourself on better ground than the coi­  
j cession here made.  
j With respect to the compliment paid  
[to the British flag, it is also  
that more is here conceded than you  
may find to be necessary. After the  
peace this compliment was pe­  
remptorily withheld by France, in spite  
of the remonstrances of G iin :  
and it remains for your inquiry,  
theritdid not continue to be ul  
notwithstanding the failure at Amiens  
to obtain from G&lt;-eat Britain a formal  
renunciation of the claim.  
From ci e-y view ot the subject, it is  
reasonable to expect that the exec \
of the narrow seas, from the Stipulation  
ipressments, will not be inflex­  
ibly maintained. Shei &gt;d it be so, your  
negociatioa will be at an end. The truth  
it~, that so great a proportion of our trade  
direct and circuitous, pasr.es thl  
those channels, and such is its peculiar  
exposure in them to the wrong practis­  
ed, thai with such exception any reme y  
would be vx ry partial. And we can never  
consent to purchase a pirtial reme J  
dy, by confirming a general evil,  
and by subjecting ourselves to our own  
reproaches, as well as to those of other  
nation.*.  
Third, It appears, as well by a letter  
from Mr. Thornton, in answer to one  
from me, of both which copies areea­  
■.&#x27;■, as from conversations with Mr.  
Merry, that the facility which would  
be given, particularly in the British  
iiel, by the immunity claimed fetf  
American vessel , to the escape oftrai­  
tors,andthe desertion of others whose  
sen i&lt;-es in time of war may be particu­  
larly Impo i enemy, forms one  
of the pie&#x27;s for the British practice of  
examining American crews, and will be  
one of the objections to a formal relin­  
quishment of it.  
This plea, like all others, hdmlti a  
sfactory reply. In the  
first place, if it could prevail r.t ai&#x27; si­  
neutral tlatm, it would a&lt;jthe«  
rise the seizui&#x27;i sons dest.]  
only, and m vessels bound to a hostile  
country only ; Whereas the practice of  
impressing is applied to persons, few or  
any of whom are alleged to be* of either  
description« and to vessels whithersoe­  
ver bound,even to Great Britain  
self. In the next place, it is  
preference of a smaller object r  
side to a greater object en the o.  
but a san nice of right on one side to

jeer-s are such as not easily to be distin­  
guished; and that without this arhitzary  
and-summary authori-y to make the dis.  
tinction, British suhj-ss-cts would , escape,  
under the name of American citizcus, from  
the duty which they owe to their sonereign.  
is then the difficulty os distinguisihisig &amp;  
mariner of one country-from the marincr  
of the other, and the importance of his  
services, a good plea for sell-tring the  
ssqttcstmn whether he bisilOﬂ&#x27;ﬂ to the one or  
to the other, to an arbizrary decision on  
the spot, by an interested and unresponsi­  
ble officer? in all other cases, the dzﬄcul­  
ty and the importance of questions are  
considered as reasons for reqotring greater  
care and formzlity in investtgatiug them,  
andssgreaterssseeurity for a right decision on  
them. To say that precautions of this.  
ct—zort are inccmpatible with the object, is to  
admit that the object is unjustifiahle; since  
the only means by which it cansibe pursued  
are such as cannot be justified.  
-..The evil takes &amp; deeper die when view­  
ed in its practice as well as its principlcs.  
Were it alinwable that British subjecxs  
  
ss should be taken out of American vessels  
  
on —the high seas, it might at least be re­  
quired that the proof of their allegiance  
  
should lie on the British side. This obvi­  
  
ous and just rule is, however, reversed;  
  
; and every seamztn on ,boai&#x27;d, though going  
  
from an American port, and sailing under  
  
sithe Americsn &quot;Rag. and sometimes even  
  
speaking an idiom proving him—not to be a­  
British subjec , is presumed to be such,  
unless proved to be an Amerisican citizcn.  
it may safely he: nffiz&#x27;ssmecl that this is an,  
  
si outrage and indignity which has no siprece.  
  
tient, and which Great Bt&#x27;itain Would be.  
  
!  
  
among the last nations in the world to ssul.  
ser, it oﬀered to her own subjects and her  
.wu Rag. Nor is it always against the  
right pscsuniption alone, which is to lat­  
wot of the citisszenship corresponding with  
the Bag, that the violence is committed --  
Not unlreq-sm-lsictv it takes place in delimce  
of the most positive proof, certificd in due  
lorm by an American officer. Let it not  
be said, that in granting to American sen­  
mensichs prdtectionifor their rights as such,  
the point is yie&#x27;ded, that the proof lies on  
the American side, and that the want of it  
in the prescribed form ssjttstisies the infer­  
encesithssssit the seaman is not of Americao  
allegimce. _.lr. is—sidis&#x27;inctly to be under.  
stood, that the certificxte usually called  
a protection to American seamen, is not  
mean: to protect them under their own, or  
evco any other neutral ﬂag on the high s&#x27;eag.  
We can neverssadmit, that in, - such a situa­  
tion, any other prOtection is required for  
them, then the ncutral &#x27;ﬂsi-tg itself on the  
high scas. The document is given to  
proveicheir real character, in situatioo&#x27;s to  
which neither the law of nations, nor the  
law of their own country, are applicable;

We confider a neutral flag, on the high f.-as.  
as a Safe guard to thofc rtitiog under it. Great  
Britain, on the contrary, aflertsa right to Search  
tor, and Seize her own fuhjefts ; and under rhat j  
cover, as cannot hnt happen, are often ft -zed j  
and taken oft, citizen* of the U. S. and citizens !  
or fuhjeifts of other neutral countries, navigat- i  
ing the high Sear, under the prote&amp;ion of the  
American Hap.  
Were the right of Great Britain* in this cafe  
not.denied, the abufr&quot; flowing from it would  
juftify the U. S. in claiming - d expetting a dif­  
i continuance of its exricife. But the r;ght is  
denied, and on the bed grounds.  
Although Gic.-U Britain has not yet adopted, I  
! in the fame. latitude with mod other nations,  
the immunities of a neutral flag, fhe will not  
deny the general freedom ef the high ft-as, and  
of neutral veffels navigatug them, with fuch ,  
exceptions only as arc anpixed to b by the law  
of nations. She molt produce then fuch an ex­  
ception in the law of nations, n favor of the  
right flic contends for. Rut in what written and  
received authority wiij ihe find it 2 In what  
ufage except her own, will it be found 2 She  
will find in both, that a neutral vtflei does not  
protect certain objedts denominated contraband  
)f war, including eneniim ferving in the war,  
nor articles gob t&gt; into a blockaded port, nor,  
j*&gt; fhe has main:.&#x27; :ed, and-as we have tint cot;­  
teiled, enemy&#x27;s property rf any kind. But no  
where will flie find an - •i.-rption *o thi freedom  
of thefeas, aud of neutr. flags. which uiftifies  
Ihe taking away of any pn. -n, no* an enemy,  
in military fervifx, found cn bo.lrd a neutral vef­  
fel.  
  
If treaties. P-itifh as we&#x27;.rs others, are to be  
confulted on this fnhjc5t, i*- will equally ap­  
pear, that no cu &quot;.utcnapcc to the practice can  
be found in ‘hen.. Whilfl they admit a con­  
traband of war, by enumerating its articles, and  
the effect of a real blockade by defining it, in no  
ir.ftar.ee do tluy afiiru. or imply a right in any  
fovereign to enforce his claims to the allegiance  
of his fubjetf*, on board neutral veflels on the  
high fea9. On the contrary, whenever a bel­  
ligerent claim again!) perfons on boat&#x27;d a neutral  
velfel, is referred to in treaties, enemies in mili­  
tary fcrvice alone are excepted from the general  
immunity of perfons in that fituation ; and this  
exception confirms the immunity of thofe who  
are not included in it.  
It is not then from the law or the ufage of  
nations, nor from the tenor of treaties, that any  
famftion can he derived for the practice in quef­  
tion. And furely it will not be pretended that  
the fovercignty of any nation extends, in any  
cafe whatever, beyond its own dominions, and  
its own vcffcls on the high feas. Such a doc­  
trine would give juft claim to all nations, and  
more than any thing would countenance the  
imputation of afpiring to an univerfil empire of  
the feas. It would he the Jefs admiffible too,  
as it would he applicable to times of peace, as  
well as to times of war, and to property as well  
as to perfons. If the law of allegiance, which  
is a municipal law, be in force at all on the high  
feas, on board foreign veflels, it mult be fo at  
all times there as it is within it* acknowledged  
fpherc. If the reafon alleged for it be good in  
time cf war, namely, that tiie foverign has then  
a right to the fcrvice of all hisfuhjelts, it muf)  
he good at all times heeaufe at all times, he has  
the fame right to their fcrvice. War is not the  
only oceafion for which he may want their fer­  
viccs, nor in external danger the only clanger  
again!) which their fertfees may Ire required for  
his fertirity. Again; if the authority of a mu­  
nic ipal law can operate on perfons in foreign  
vrfTels on the high feas, heeaufe within the do­  
minion of their fovereign they would be fubjeft  
to that law, and arc violating that law by being  
in that fituation, how rcjeifl the inference that  
the authority erf a municipal law may equally be  
enforced, on hoard foreign veffels, on the high  
feas, againfl articles of property exported in  
violation nf fnch a law, or belonging to the  
country from which it was exported ? And  
thus every commercial regulation, in time of  
peace too, a* well as of war, would hr made ob­  
ligatory on foreigners and their vcffcls, not on­  
ly whilfl within the dominion of the fovereign  
making the regulation, but in every fea, and at  
every diftancc where an armed veffi I might meet  
with them. Another is ft fence deferves atten­  
tion. If the (objects of one fovereign ni.sy be  
  
the high feas, the ripht of taking them when  
found, implies the tight offearching for them ; ;  
a vexation of commerce, efpecially in time of J  
peace, which has not yet been attempted, and I  
which forth it as Well as other reafons, may be &#x27;  
regarded a* contradicting the principle from j  
which it would flow.  
Taking reafon and jufticc for the tcfts of this I  
practice, it is peculiarly indefenfiblr; becaufe  
it deprives thedeareft rights of perfqns of a re­  
gular trial, to which the moft inconfiderable ar­  
ticle of property captured on the high fcas, is  
entitled; and leaves their delliny to the will of;  
an officer, fometimes cruel, often ignorant, and ‘  
generally interefted by his want of mariners, in j  
bis own dcciflons. Whenever property found J  
in a neutral vcflcl, is fuppofed to be liable on &#x27;  
any grounds to capture and condemnation, the •  
nlc in all cafes is that the queftiou ffiall not be .  
decided by the captor, but be carried before a 1  
iegal tribunal, where a regular trial may be had,  
and where the captor himfelf is liable to damag. j  
es, for an abufe ot his power. Can it lie reafon- ;  
able then, or juft, that a belligerent commander !  
  
who is thus reftridcd, and thus refponfible in a  
cafe of mere property of trivia* amount fhould 1  
be permitted, without recurring to any tribunal &#x27;  
whatever, to examine the crew of a neutral vef- j  
fel, to decide the important queftion of their j  
refpeftivc allegiances, and to carry that decifi- |  
on into inltant execution, by forcing every in* 1  
dividual hemaychufe, into&#x27;a fervice abhorrent  
to his feelings, cutting him off from his molt  
tender connections, exposing his mind and his  
perfon to the moft humiliating difciplinc, and  
his life itfelf to the greateft dangers ? Reafon,  
juftice and humanity, unite in protefting againft  
I&#x27;o extravagant a proceeding. And what is the  
pretext for it i It is that the fimilarity of lan­  
guage and of features between American citi­  
zens and Britifli fuhjeCts, arc fuch a3 not cafily  
to be diftinguifiied ; and that without this ar­  
bitrary and funnmary authority to make the dif­  
tinction, Britifli fubjedls would efcape, under  
the name of American citizens, from the duty  
which they owe to their lovereign. Is then the  
difficulty of diftinguilhing a mariner of one  
country from the mariner of the other, and the  
importance of his fervices, a good plea for re­  
ferring the queftion whether he belongs to the  
one or to the other, to an arbitrary decifion on  
the fpot, by an interefted and Hnrefponfible of­  
ficer ? In all other cafes, the difficulty and the  
importance of queftions are confidered as rca- j  
ions for requiring greater care and formality in  
| inveftigating them, and greater fecurity for a  
right decifion on them. To fay that prce&amp;uti­  
I ons of this fort are incompatible with the ob­  
| j‘ dt, is to admit that the ohjedt is unjuftifiahle ;  
j fince the only means by which it can be purfu­  
ed are fuch as cannot bejuflified.  
riie evil takes a deeper die, when viewed in  
its practice as well as its principles. Were it  
allowable that Bririfh fubjedls fhould be taken  
out of American veltels on tile high feas, it  
might at leaft be required that the proof of their  
allegiance fhould lie on the Britifh lide. This  
obvious and juft rule is, however, reverfed ;  
and every feamen on board, though going from  
an American port, and failing under the Ame­  
rican flag, and fometimes even foenking an idi­  
om proving him not to be a Britifh fuhjcdl, is  
prefumed to he fuch, unlef? fhewn to be an A­  
nacrican citizen. It mayfafelybe affirmed that  
this is an outrage and an indignity which has  
no precedent, and which Great Britain would  
be among the laft nations in the world to fuffer,  
if offered to her own fubjedls, and her own  
flag. Nor is it always againft the right prefump­  
tton alone, which is in favor of the citize ifhip  
correlponding with the flag, that the violence is  
committed, Nutunfrequcntly it takes place  
in defiance of the moft pofitive proof, certified  
in due form by an American officer. Let it not  
i be ftid, that in granting to American feamen  
t is protection for their rights as fuch, the point  
is yielded, that tUe proof lies on the American  
lide, and that the want ot it in the preferibed  
form juftifies the inference that the feamen is  
not of American allegiance. It is diftinaiyto  
h» understood, that the certificate ulually cil­  
led a protection to American feamen, is not  
niearit to prntedt them under their own, or even  
any other neutral flag on the high feas. We can  
i nevf r admit, that in fuch a fituatinn, any other  
; protection js required for them, than the neu­  
t tra! flag itfelf on the high feas. The document  
. is given to prove their real charadlcr, in fitua­  
tr.uis to vvhich neither the law of nations, nor  
I the law .»&lt; their own country, are applicable;  
1 wort^s» to protedl them within the ju­  
rifdidtion of the Britifh laws, and to ftcure to  
them, within every other jurifdidlion, the rights  
and immunities due to them. If in the courfe  
of their navigation even on the high feas, the  
document fhould have the cffedl of repe&#x27;ling  
wrongs ofany fort, it is an incidental advan­  
tage only, of which they avail thcmfclves, and  
is by no means to be mifeonftrued into a right  
toexadr fuch a proof, or to make any difadvan­  
tageous interference from the want of it.  
Were it even admitted that certificates for  
protection might be juftly required in time of  
war, from American feamen, they could only  
he required in cafes where the lapfe of time  
from its commencement, had given an oppor­  
tunity for the American feanv.n to provide  
. cmfelves with, fuch a document. Yet it is  
certain that in a variety of inftances, feamen  
have been imprefled from American veffels, on  
the pleii that they had net this proof of citizen­  
fhip, when the dates and placesof the impieff­  
ments demonftrated the impoffibility of their  
knywing, in time to provide the proof, that a  
ftr.te of war had rendered it neceffary.  
Whether, therefore, we confult the law of  
nations, the tenor of treaties, or the didtates  
of reafon and juftice, no warrant, no pretext  
can hr found for the Britifh pradlice of making  
unpreffments from American veffels on the  
high feas.  
  
Great Britain has the |efs to fay in exmfc for  
this practice, as it is in direct contradiction to  
the principles on which fhe proceeds in other  
cafes. Whilft (he claims and feizes on the liirh  
teas, her own fubjeCts, voluntarily ferving in A­  
merican vefTels, die has conftantly given, when  
ftic could-give, as areafon for not difcl.a.ghig  
from her fervice American citizens, that they  
^oluntarijy engaged in it. Nay, more,  
whilft fhe imprefles her own fnbjcCIs from the  
American fervice.afthough they may have been  
it o married, and even naturalifed in the  
U. S. fhe conftantly refufes to releafe from  
her s, American citizens imprcfTed into it,  
whenever fhe can give for a reafoii, that they  
were either fettled or married within her domi­  
nions. Thus, when the voluntary confent of  
the individual favors her pretenfions, fhe pleads  
the validity of that confent. When the volun­  
tary confent of the individual (lands in the way  
of her pretenfions, it goes for nothing ! When  
marriage or refidence can be pleaded in her fa­  
vor, flie avails hcrfclfof the pie,. When mar­  
riage and rcfidcnce, and even naturalization  
arc agamft her, no refpcifl whatever is paid to  
either. She takes by force her own fubjetfts,  
voluntarily ferving in our vefTels. She keeps

not be imagine &lt;i.  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives which  
ought *o be felt by the Britifh government to  
i relmquilh a practice which expofesit la to nia­  
  
77&quot; IBM 0M*Woft1To7  
difieri*lit forts will he prefTed on you. Tou wilt  
be told firft, of the great number of Britifti fea­  
me&#x27;&#x27;1,1 *ke American trade, and of the ntcrlR­  
ty for their lervices in time of war and danger.  
Secondly, of the right and the prejudice of the  
Britifti nation, with refpedt to what are called  
the Britifh or narrow feas, where its domain  
would be abandoned by the general ftipulatiou  
required. Thirdly, of the life which would be  
made of fuch a faniluary as that of American  
veflcls, for defertions, and traiteroua commu­  
nication to her enemies, cfpeciaily acrofs the  
channel to France.  
^lft. With refped to the Britifli teamen ferving in  
our trade, it may Ins remarked, firft, that the num­  
ber, though confidcrable, improbably left titan may be  
fuppoled. Secondly, that w-hat is wrong in iifelf can­  
not be made right by confiderations of expediency or  
advantage. &#x27;1 hirdly.tliat it is proved by the fad, that  
the number of real Britifh fubjeds gained by the  
prxdicc in queilinn, is of confidcrable importance,  
even in the fcaie of advantage. The annexed report  
to Cmgreft on the fubjed of iinprefTinents, with the  
addi tion of fuch cafes as may be in the hands of Mr.  
Erving, will verify the remark in its applicatiwn to  
the prefent war. The ftateinem nu/.c by his pred-^  
cellor during the latt war, and which is alfo annexed,  
is in the fame view Hill more conduliv. The  
llateuicot comprehends not only ail the application*  
made by him ift the firft inftance, for die liberation  
of impreffeo feamcn, between the month of June 171,7  
and September, &lt;801, but many alfo which had been’  
made previous to his agency, by Mr. Pinckney and  
Mr. King, and which it was neceflary for him to re­  
new. Thefe applications therefo.e may fairly be  
confidercd as embracing the greater part of the peri­  
od of the war ; and as applications are known to be  
pretty mdifcriminately made, they may furthti be  
eonfidered as embracing, if not the whole, the far  
greater part of the imprelTments.thofe of Britifli fub­  
jeCts as well as others. Yet the refult exhibits 2,053  
cafes only, and of this number 102 feamen only, de­  
tained as being Britifh fubjeds, which is left than  
1-20 of the number ininreffed, and J ,1 -12 difeharged  
or ordered to be fo, as not beir.* Britifh fubjeds,  
winch is more than half of the wHole number, leav­  
ing 805 for further proof, with the ft rouge ft pre­  
fmnption that the greater part, if not the whole, were  
Americans or other Aliens, whole proof of citi-eu­  
fhip had been loft or deftroved, or whole fixation­  
would account for the difficulties and . delays in pro­  
ducing it. So that it is certain, that for all the Bri­  
tish feamen gained by this violent proceeding, more  
than an equal number w ho were not fo w ere the vic­  
tims ; it is highly probable that for every Britifh fea­  
men fo gained, a number of others, left than 10 for  
one, muft have been tile vidims, and it is even pofii­  
ble that this number may have exceeded the proporti­  
on of 20 to one. 1  
  
It cannot therefore he doubted, that the acquifition  
of Bntilh feamen, by tlicfe iniprelTment.v, whatever  
maybe its advantage,is loft in the wrong done to  
Americana ignorantly or wilfully miftaken ?«r British  
fubjeds.in the jealoufy and ill-will excited among ma­  
ritime nations by an adherence to fuch a pradice, and  
m the particular provocation to meafures of redrefs on  
the part of the United States, not lefs dil’agreeabie to  
them, than embarraflir.g to Great Britain, and which  
may threaten the #ood underAandintr which otrdit to  
he faithfully cultivated by both. The copy of a bdl  
brought into Gongrefs uuder tile influence of violati­  
ons committed on our flag, gives force to this Litter  
consideration. Whether it wiil pafs into a law, and  
at the prefeut leflsoii, is more than can yet be faid. As  
there is every realon to believe that it has been pro­  
poi«d with rcludance, it will probably not be purlu­  
ed into efled, if any hope can be fupportedof a re­  
tuedy, by an amicable arrangement between the t*vo  
nations  
1 here is a further cor.fideratinn which ought to have  
weight in this queftion. Although the Britifh iea­  
nien employed in carrying on American commerce, be  
hi fonie i **it eds loft to their own nation, yet fuch is  
the intimate and extcnlive connexion of this commerce,  
dired and circuitous, with the commerce, the manu­  
factures, revenue, and the general refources of tk»  
B. it.fli nation,’.hat in other reij eds its mariners, ou  
board American veflois, may truly be faid to be re-i­  
deringit the moft valuable fervices. It would not be  
extravagant to make it a queftion, whether Giv- -  
Britain would not luller more by withdrawing her  
teamen from the merchant veflelsof the U. States;  
than her enemies would fuffer from the addition of  
them to the crews of hcrlhipsof war, and erttizers.  
Should an) difficulty be ftarted concerning feamen  
born within the britilu dominions, and naturalized by  
the U. S. fince the treaty of I7K3, von may remove’  
it by obfervir.g : Firft, that very few, if any fuch na­  
turahzations can take place, the law here requiring a  
preparatory refidence of five years, with notice of the  
intention to become a citizen entered of record two  
years before the laft. neceflary formality,befidcs a re­  
gular proof of good moral charader, conditions littl*  
likely to be complied with by ordinary feu-faring per­  
lons. Secondly, that a difc.i&#x27;itinuance ofimprcflments  
oil the high feas will preclude an adual col&#x27;ifi-.n be­  
tween the interfering claims. Within the iimfdidiou  
of each nation, and in their tefpedive vtffels on the  
high leas, each will enforce the allegiance which it  
claims. In other fictions the individuals doubly  
claimed, will be within a jurifdidio* indepeudent «f  
, both nations.  
  
Secondly, The Britifh pretcnfions to domain ov,r  
the narrow Teas art? io nhlolete and *0 indcfonfiMe  
that they never would have occurred as a probable  
objedion in this cafe, ii they had not ailuully fi nfira­  
ted an arrangement fettled by Mr. King v.ith the  
Bntilh miniflry on the fubiedi of impreflinciits from  
American vefT-ls on the high feas. At the moment v  
when the articles were expelled to be figned, an ,-x­  
ception of the “ narrow feas” was urged and infilled  
on by lord St. Vincent; and being utterly inadn. t­  
fib.e on otrr part, the r.egociation was abandoned.  
—-1’he objetftion in itfclf has certainly not the flight­  
eft foundation. The time has been, indeed, when  
England not only claimed, but extreifed pretenfions  
tcarcvly inferior to full fovereignty over the feas fur­  
rounding the Britifh ifles, and even as far as Cape l&#x27;i­  
mftere to the fouth, and Van Staten, in Norway, to  
tne north. It was a time, however, when reafvtl  
had little fharc in determining ihe law, and the in­  
tercourfe of nation* ; when power alone decided ques­  
tionsof right, and when the ignorance, and want of  
concert among other maritime countries facilitated  
fuch an ufirpation. The progrefs of civilization and  
and information has produced a change in all thole  
refpeiSs, and no principle in the code of public law  
ii at prefent better ellabiilhed, than the common free­  
dom of the feas beyond a very limited diftance from  
the territories walhed by them. This diftance is not  
indeed fixed with abfolutc precifion. It is varied irv  
a fmall degree by written authorities, and peii.arv  
it may he reafonably varied in (nine degree by bcai  
peculiarities. But the greateft diftance which would  
now be liflrned to any where, would rti.d.v a jmsll  
proportion of the narroweft part of the narrov/rft fe .  
in queftion.  
  
| Wlist are, in fa&lt;9, the prerogative* claimed agd  
exercifed by Ci. Britain over tbefc teas? If the/  
were really a part of her domain, her authority would  
be the fame there a* within her other domain. Fo­  
reign vefTel* would be fubjeA to all the law* and re­  
gulations framed for them, at much a* if they w,re  
within the harbor* or river* of the country. Nothing  
of this fort i* pretended. Nothing of this fort would  
be tolerated. The only inftancr* in which thefe fca*  
are diftinguifhed from other f«a»,or in which G. Bri­  
tain enjoys within them, any diftindlion over other  
nations, are firft the compliment paid by other flag*

Britifh monarch*, and at length fo properly fatrificed  
to the leifoas ef magnanimous wifdom. As far as  
this homage to the Britifh flag has any foundation at  
prefent, it refts merely on long ufage and long acqui­  
efcence, which are conftrued, as in a few other cafes  
of maritime claims .into the effed ef a general though  
tacit convention. The fecund inftance is the exten­  
fion of the territorial jurifdidion to four leagues from  
the (bore. This too, as far as the diftance may ex­  
ceed that which is generally allowed, refts on a like  
foundation, ftrengthened, perhaps, by the local faci­  
lity of fmuggling, and the peculiar filtered which G.  
Britain has in preventing a pradiceof afledtng fo deep­  
ly her whole fylleni of revenue, commerce and ma­  
im failures ; whilft the limitation itfelf to four leagues  
neceffarily implies that beyond that diftance no terri­  
torial jurifdidion is aflumed.  
But whatever may be the origin or the value of  
thefe prerogatives over foreign flags in one cafe, and  
within a limited portion of thefe feas in aiiother, it it  
obvions that neither of them will be violated by the  
exemption of American vcffels from imprefl&#x27;ments,  
which are no wife conneded with either; having ne­  
ver been made on the pretext either of withholding  
the wonted homage to the Britifti flag, or of fmug­  
gling in defiance of Britifh laws.  
This extenfion of the Britifh law to four leagues  
from the ftiore, is inferred from an ad of parliament  
palled in the year 173€ (9 C. 2 c. 95) the term* of  
which comprehend all vcffels foreign as well as Bri­  
tifli. It is poflible however, that the former are con­  
flrucAively excepted. Should your enquiries ascer­  
tain this to be the cafe, you will find yourfelf on bet­  
ter ground than the conceflion here made.  
With refped to the compliment paid to the Britifti  
flag, it,is alfo poflible that more is here conceded than  
you may find to be neceffary. After the peace of  
1783 this compliment was peremptorily withheld by  
France, in fpite of the reman (trances of Great Bri­  
tain ; and it remains for your enquiry, whether it  
did not continue to be refufed, not withftandixg the  
failure at Amiens to obtain from Geeat Britain a for­  
mal renunciation of the claim.  
From every view of the fubjed, it is reafonable to  
exped that the exception of the narrow feas, from  
the ftipulation againft imprefl&#x27;ments, will not be in­  
flexibly maintained. Should it be fo, your negocia­  
tion will be at an end. The truth is, that fo great  
a proportion of our trade dired and circuitous, paff­  
es through thofe channels, andfuch is its peculiar ex  
pofiire in them to the wrong pradifed, that with  
fuch exception any remedy would be very partial.  
And we can never confent to purchafe a partial re­  
medy, by confirming a general evil, and by fubjed­  
ing ourfelves to our own reproaches as well as to thofe  
of other nations.  
  
Third, It appears, as well by a letter from Mr.  
Thornton, iti atifwer to 6ne from me, of both which  
coplea are etic.ofed, as from conversions with Mr.  
Merry, that the facility which would be .riven par­  
ticularly in the Britifh channel, by the*’ immunity  
claimed for American velTcls, to theefcape of traitors  
and the defection of others whofe fervices in time  
of war may be particularly important to an enemy  
form s one of th» pleas for the Britifh practice of ex­  
amining American crews, and will be one of the ob­  
je&lt;51io06 to a formal rt linquilhmcnt of it.  
This plea like all others, admits a folid and fatis­  
fa^ory reply In the firft place, if it could prevail  
at all again ft the neutral claim, it would aHthonfe the  
leizure of the perfons defcribed only, and in vefTels

of impreflTmg is applied to perfons, -few or any of  
whom are alledgedto be of either defeription, &amp; to vef­  
fels whitherfott-.-er bound, even to ®. Britain herfelf.

We consider a neutral 9 .g, on the high seas, as a  
safeguard to those s .i.ing under it. Great Britain,on  
the contrary, asserts aright to search for, and to  
seize her own subjects ; and under that cover, as  
cannot but happen, are often seized and taken off,  
citizens of the United Suies, and citizens or sub­  
jects of other neutral countries, navigating the  
high seas, under the protection of the American  
flag.  
Were the right of Great Britain, in this case not  
denied, the abuse* flowing from it would justify the  
United States in claiming ami expecting a disconti­  
nuance of its exercise. But the right is denied, and  
on the best grounds;  
Although Grc it Britain has not vet adopted, in the  
same lattituue with most other nations, the immuni­  
ties of a neutral flag, she will tint deny the general  
freedom of the high seas, and of neutral vessels na­  
  
* &quot;b uukih-aviihiuiu t/iiij&#x27; as n; t cm  
ncxeiJtu it by the law of nations. She must produo  
such an exception in the law of nations, in favour •  
the right she contends for. But in what written ai.f  
reccivejl authority will she find it f In what usage  
cxrept her own will it be found ? She will find i&#x27; j  
both, that a neutral vessel does not protect certain  
objects denominated contraband of war, including  
enemies serving in the war, nor articles going into a  
blockaded port, nor, as she has maintained, and as  
we have not contested, eneim’s property of any  
j kind. But no where will she find an exception to  
! this freedom ot the seas, and of neutral flags, which  
justifies the taking away of anv person not an ene­  
my, in military service, found on board a neutral  
vessel.  
| li treaties, British as well as others, are to be con­  
sulted on this subject, it will equally appear, that no  
countenance to the practice can be found in them.  
\\ hilst they admit a contraband of war, by enume­  
rating its articles, and the effect of a real blockade  
by defining it, in no Instance do they affirm or imply  
a right in any sovereign to enforce bis claims to the  
nhcginnce of his subjects, on board neutral vessels on  
the high seas. On the contrary, whenever a bellige­  
rent claim against persons on board a neutral vessel,  
is referred to in treaties, enemies in military&#x27; service  
alone are excepted from the general immunity of  
persons in that situation; and this exception con­  
fit ins the immunity of those who are not included  
in it.  
  
1- ,s not then from trie law or the usage of nations,  
nor from tin; tenciur of treaties, that any sanction can  
be derived lor the practice in question. And surely  
it will not be pretended that the sovereignty of any  
nation extends, in any case whatever beyond its own  
dominions, and its own vessels on the high seas.  
Such a doctrine would give just claim to all nations,  
and more than any thing would countenance the im­  
putation of a-pit tug to an universal empire of the  
seas. It would be the less admissible too, as it would  
be applicable in times of peace, as well as to times  
ot war, and to property as well as to persons. If  
t.ie law of allegiance, which is a municipal law, be  
at Ion e at all on the high seas, on board foreign ves­  
sels, it must be so at all times there, as it is within its  
acknowledged sphere. If the reason alleged for it  
be good in tune of war, namelv, that the sovereign  
has then a right to the service of all his subjects, it  
must be good at all times because at all times, be has  
the same right to their service. &#x27; War is not the on­  
ly occasion for which he may want their services,  
nor is external danger the only danger against which  
their services may be required, for his security.  
Again ; it the authority of a municipal law can ope­  
rate on persons in foreign vessels on the high seas,  
because within the dominion ot their sovereign tliev  
would be subject to that law, and the violating that  
law by being in that situation, how reject that infer­  
ence that the authority of a municipal law may  
equally be enforced, on board foreign vessels on the  
high seas, against articles of property exported in  
violation of such a law, or belonging to the country  
from which it was exported i and thus every com­  
mercial regulation, in time of peace too, as we ll as  
of war, would be made obligatory on foreigners and I  
their vessels, not only whilst within the dominion of  
the sovereign making the regulation, but in every  
sea, and at every distance where an armed vessel  
might meet with them. Another inference deserves  
attention. If the subjects of one sovereign may he  
taken by force from the vessels of another, on the  
higu seas, the right of taking them when found, im­  
plies the right of searching for them ; a vexation of  
commerce, especially in time of peace, which has  
not yet been attempted, and which for that as well as  
ether reasons, may he regarded as contradicting the  
principle from which it would flow.  
Taking reason and justice for the tests of this  
practice, it is peculiarly indefensible ; because it do­  
pnves the dearest right* &lt;&gt;t pm &gt;^,,c of u «•* i- I  
al, to which the most inconsiderable article of pro- I  
periy captured on the high seas, is entitled ; and I  
leaves their destiny to the will ot ail officer, some- ^  
times creel, often ignor^t, and generally interest- !  
e i by his want ot manners, in his own decisions.—  
Whenever projHrrty found in a neutral vessel, is sup­  
posed to be liable on any grounds to capture and con­  
demnation, the rule in all cases is that the question  
shall not be derided by the captor, but lx; carried be- ;  
foie a tribunal, where a regular trial may be had, j  
and where the captor himself is liable to damages, |  
  
““ ;usr ms power. t,an it r&gt;c reasonable  
tin i), or just, tint a belligerent commander who is  
thus restricted, and thu-, responsible in a case rd  
more property of trivial amount, should, be permit­  
ted, without recurrin;; to anv tribunal whatever, to  
examine the crew of a neutral vessel, to decide the  
important question of their respective allegiances,  
and to carry that decision into instant execution,  
by forcing every individual he may chase, into a  
service abhorrent to his feeling, cutting him off from  
his most tender connection, exposing his mind and  
his person to to the muse humiliating discipline, and  
his life itself to the greatest dangers ? Reason, jus­  
tice and humanity unite in protestmg against so ex­  
travagant a proceeding. And what is the pretext  
tor it ? It is that the similarity of language and of  
features between American citizens anil British sub­  
jects, are such as not easily to be distinguished ; and  
that without this arbitrary and summary authority to  
make the distinction, British subjects would escape,  
under the1 name of American citizens, from the duty  
which tlicv owe to their sovereign. Is then the dif­  
ficulty of distinguishing a mariner of one country  
from the mariner of the other, and the importance  
of his services, a good pica for referring the ques­  
tion whether he belongs to the one or to the other, to  
an arbitrary decision on the spot, by an interested  
and unresponsible officer ? In all other cases, the dif­  
ficulty and the importance of questions are consider­  
ed as reasons for requiring greater care and forma­  
lity in investigating them, and greater security for a  
right decision on them. To say that precautions of  
this sort arc incompatible with the object, is to ad­  
mit that the .object is unjustifiable ; since the only  
means by which it can be pursued arc such as cannot  
be justified.  
The ev il takes a deeper die, when viewed In its  
practice as well as its principles. Were it allowable  
that British subjects should be taken-out of Ameri­  
can vessels on the high se-.s, it might at least be re­  
quired that the proof of their allegiance should lie  
on the British side. This obvious and just rule is,  
however, reversed ; and every seaman on board,  
though going from an American’ port, and sailing un­  
der the American flag, and sometimes even speak­  
ing an idiom proving him not to lie a British subject,  
is presumed to be such, unless shewn to be an  
American citizen. It may safely he affirmed that  
this is an outrage and an indignity which has no pre­  
cedent, and which Greet Britain would be the  
last nation in the world to suffer, if offered to her  
own subjects, and her own flag. Nor is it alwavs  
against the right presumption alone, which is in fa­  
vour of the citizenship corresponding with the flag,  
that the violence is committed. Not unfrequently it  
takes place in defiance of the most positive proof,  
certified in due form by an American officer. Let it  
not be said, that in granting to American seamen  
this protection for their rights as such, the point is  
yielded, that the proof lies on the American side,  
and that the want of it in the prescribed form justi­  
fies the inference that the seaman is nut of Ameri­  
can allegiance. It is distinctly to he understood, that  
the certificate usually called a protection to Amen  
can seamen, ts not meant to protect them under tln.ii  
own, or even any other neutral flag on the high seas.  
  
VVC can ner«-r artn.it, that in such a situation, am I  
.then protection is required for them, than the nco  
r d flag itself on the high seas, i’he document i- i  
given to prove their re d character, in situations t&lt; !  
which neither the law of nations, nor the law 01  
iheir own country, are applicable ; in other words. J  
to protect them within the jurisdicti m of the Bri- |  
Msh laws, and to secure to them, within every other  
jurisdiction, the rights and immunities due to them  
if in the course of their navigation even on the high  
seas, the document should have the effect of repelling  
wrongs of any soit, it is an incidental advantage om  
lv,of which tlicv avail themselves, Sc is bv no means  
to be construed into a right to exact such a proof, or  
to make any disadvantageous interference from the  
want of it.  
Were it even admitted that certificates for protec­  
tion might be justly required in time of war, from j  
American seamen, thev could only be required in  
cases where the lapse of time from its commence- |  
ment, had given an opportunity for the Ameruan !  
seamen to provide themselves wit a such a document.  
Vet it is certain that in a variety of instances, sea­  
men have been imnressed from American vessels on  
the plea that they had not this proof of ettizenshiti,  
when the dates and places of the impressments demon­  
strated the impossibility of their knowing, in time to  
provide the proof, that a state of war had rendered  
necessary.  
  
ucmer, uicrcrore, wec.onsult thelnw ofnations.  
t!ie tenor of treaties, or the dictates of reason and  
justice, no warrant, no pretext can he found for tin­  
British practice of making impressments from Ame­  
rican vessels on the high seas.  
Grout-Britain has the less to say in excuse for this  
practice, as it is in direct contradiction to the prin­  
ciples on which she proceeds in other cases. Whilst  
she claims and seizes on the high seas, her own sub­  
jects, voluntarily serving in American vessels, she  
has constantly given, when she could give, as a rea­  
son for not discharging from her service American  
citizens, that they had voluntarily engaged in it._  
Na\, more, wnilst she impresses her own subjects  
from the American service, although they may have  
been settled and married, and even naturalized in  
the U. States, she constantly refuses to release from  
her’s, American citizens impressed into it, whenev­  
er she can give for a reason, that they were either  
settled nr married within her dominions. Thus, when  
the voluntary consent of the individual favours her  
pretensions, she pleads the validity of tint consent.  
When the voluntary o nsent of the&#x27;indii idual stands  
in the way of her pretensions, it goes for nothing i  
When marriage or residence can he pleaded in ifer  
favour, she avails herself of the plea. When mar­  
riage and residence, and even naturalization are a­  
gainst her. no respect whatever is paid to either ! —  
She takes by force her own subjects, vnhr.t.ri&#x27;c serv­  
ing in our vessels. She keeps by force Am- ric.m  
citizens, involuntarily servingin hers. More flat-rant  
inconsistencies cannot he imagined. °  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives which ought  
to be felt by the British g-ivcrnnu nt t &gt; relinquish a  
practice whicu exposes it to so m my reproaches, it  
is foreseen that objections of different sorts will he  
pressed on vou. You will be told first, of the great  
number of British seamen in the American trade,  
of the necessity for their services in time of war and  
danger. Secondly, of the right and prejudice of the  
British nation, with respect to what are called the  
British or narrow seas, where its domain would be  
abandoned by the general stipulation requited_  
thirdly, of the use which would be made of such a  
sanctuary ns that of American vessels, lordescrtions,  
and traiterous communications to her enemies, espe­  
cially across the channel to France.  
1st. \\ itli respect to the British scanscti sereins- j  
in our trade, it may be remarked, first, that the !  
number, though considerable, is probably- less chan i  
may be supposed. Secondly, that what i- wiongiul  
Ue mane iiguiuy considerations of ex­  
pediency or advantage. Thirdly, that it is proved |  
by the tact, that the number of real British subjects  
gained by the practice inquestion. is of inconsidera­  
ble imp -rtance, everi in the scale of advantage, The ^  
annexed report to Congress on the subject of imr-icss- !  
meuts, with the addition of such cases as may he in j  
the hands ot Mr. Erring, will verify the remark in  
its application to the present war. The statement  
made by his predecessor during the last war, and  
which is also annexed, is in the same view still more  
conclusive. The statement comprehends not onlv  
  
.... iwu.iii!, mauc i;y mm in the first instance,  
for the liberation of impressed seamen, between the  
m&lt; iii111 of June, 1, 97, anti Sept. 1801, but many also  
winch hatl been made previous to his agency, bv Mr.  
Pinckney and Mr. King, and which it was ntcessa­  
i\ for him to renew. I hese applications tl?trefore  
may fairly be considered as embracing the greater  
part of the period ot the war ; and as applications  
are known to t&gt;e pretty indiscriminately mule, they  
may farther be considered as embracing, if not the  
whole, the far greater part of the impressments,  
those of British subjects as well as others. Yet the  
result exhibits 2,059 cases only, and of this nunb-r  
10- seamen only, detained ns being Briti.h subjects,  
which is less than 1-20 ot the number impressed, and  
l.l tp discharged or ordered to be so, as not bei..­  
British subjects, which is more thin half of the -.vVie  
number, leaving 80.5 for further proof, with th &gt;  
strongest presumption that the greater r : rt, if not  
the whole, were Americans or other aliens, where  
proof citizenship liad been lost or destroyed, or whose  
situation would account for the difficulties and delays  
in producing it. So that it iscertain, that for all the  
Bntrdi seamen gained by this vi dent proceeding,  
more than an equal number who were not so were  
the victims ; it is highly probable that for every Bri­  
tish seaman gained, a number of others, less than  
ten for one, must have been the vii tims, and it is  
even possible that this number may have exceeded  
the proportion of 20 to one.  
It cannot therefore be doubted, that the acquisition  
of British seamc n by these impressments, whatever  
may beits advantages, is lost in the wrong done to  
Americans u.nor .ally or wilfully mistaken for Brit­  
ish subjects, in the jealousy and ill-will excited a­  
mong all maritime nations by an adherence to such  
a practice, and in the particular provocation to mea­  
sures of redress on the part of the U. States, not less  
disagreeable to them, than embarrassing to Greut­  
Britain, which may threaten the good understand­  
ing which ought to be faithfully cultivated by both.—  
The copy of a bill brought into Congress under the  
influence of violations committed on our II ig, gives  
force to this latter consideration. Whether it will  
pass into a law, and at toe present session, is more  
th in can vet be said. As there is every reason to  
believe that it has been proposed with reluctance, it  
will probably not be pursued into effect, if any hope  
can be supported of a remedy, by an amicable ar­  
rangement between the two nations.  
There is a further consideration which ought to  
have weight in this question. Although the British  
seamen employed in carrying on American com­  
merce, he in some respect lust to their own nation,  
yet such is the intimate and extensive connexion of  
this commerce, direct and circui i us, with the com­  
merce, the m mifxctures, revenue, and the general  
resources of the British nation, that in other respects  
its mariners, on board American vessels, may trulv  
be s lid to be gendering it the most valuable services, j  
It would not be extravagant to make it a question,  
whether Great Britain would not suffer more by  
withdrawing her seamen from&#x27;the merchant vessel,  
of the United States, than her enemies would suffer  
from the addition of them to the crews of her ships  
a war and cruisers. , 1  
  
v,]io-.ild any difficulty be started concerning sc-’men  
bnni within the ! tiibh dominions, and&#x27;naturalized  
by the United States mix e llie treaty of IT\c.u  
(&quot;ay remove it hv observing! First, that very few,  
ii any sui h naturalizations can take place, the law  
here requiring a prepnatnry residence of five years  
with notice ot the intention to become a citizen entetl  
ed of record two years before the last necessary for.  
nullity, besides a regular prCof of good nu.ral’ chit,  
raster, cotitli. ions little likely to he complied with by  
ordinary sea-faring persons. Secondly, that a dis­  
continuance &lt; r. impressments on the high seas will  
preclude ; imn tuxl f.oiltssion between the interferin&#x27;*  
claims. Y\ ithin the jurisdiction of each nation, and  
in their respective vessels on the high seas, each  
will enfi rce the.allegiance which it claims. In other  
situations the individuals doubiv claimed, will be  
within a jurisdiction independent’of botii nations.  
■condly. The iiritish pretesions to domain over  
lie n u row seas are so obsolete&#x27; and so indefen :&#x27;-&#x27;~  
&#x27;liat they never would h ive occurred as a probable  
0 m otion in this Case, if they had not actually frus­  
t&#x27;ated an arrangement settled by Mr. King with the.  
Ki itish ministry on the subject of impressments from  
American vessels ori the high seas. At the moment  
when the articles were expected to be signed, an ex­  
ception of toe ‘‘narrow seas” was urged and insisted  
on bv h.id St. \ lucent; and being utterly inadmissi­  
ble ou cur part, tlie negociatnm was abandoned.  
I he objection in itself has certainly not the slight..  
rst foundation. The time Ins been’, indeed when  
I&#x27;.ngland not only claimed, but exercised prc%r. ,ion%  
scai civ inferiour to Tull sov erc&#x27;nrotv over the S&#x27; e &lt; in  
rounding the lfritMi isles, ami even -« far&#x27; -Vs ci.ne  
Finistcre to the south, and Van Staten, in Norway  
to the north. It was a time, however, when ret srm  
• l.ul h.t.c share in determining the law, and Mm ii.­  
terc.Gur.se of nations; when power alone decided  
questions of right, and when the ignorance and want  
ot r &gt;ni ei t among other m u itimeoMintiies facilitated  
such an usurpation. The nro-rcss of civilization and  
information has produced a change in all those ins­  
pects, arid no principle in the code of publiek law is  
;t present better established, than the common free­  
t.om ot t..e seas beyond a very limited distance from  
the territories washed by them. This distance is  
not, indeed, fixed with absolute precision, ft is va­  
1 led in a small dertjee bv written authorities, and  
perhaps it may be reasonably varied in some degree  
by local peculiarities. Rut the greatest dUtatvce  
winch would now be listened to any where, would  
inai-.e a small proportion of tire narrowest part of the  
narrowest seas in question.  
  
V “7‘ ‘perogatrvcs claimed and ex­  
ercised nv (neat Hritrin over these seas ? If the/  
were really :i part nf her domain, her authority would  
be the same there :is within her other d .mains. Fo­  
reign vessels would he subject to all the laws and re­  
gnhtions fr ..tied lor them, as tnurh as if they were  
&quot;t!lc ‘lurhours or rivers of the country. Nothing  
of tin s sort is pretended. Nothing of this sort would  
be tolerated, The only instances in which these seas  
a; ■;distinguished from other seas, or in which Great  
bri.ain enjoys within them, any distinction iatr  
other nations, are first, the compliment paid hv  
other flags to hers. Secondly, the extension of her  
territorial jurisdiction in certain Cases to the distance  
of four league, from the coast. This first is a rthek  
ot ancient usurpation, which has thus long escaped  
the correction, which modern and more enlightened  
times have aptdied to other usurpations. The prern­  
tMtive has !« en often contested, however, even at the  
expeiice_ofhloo.lv wars, and is still borne with ill  
w ill and impatience by her neighbours. At the last  
treatv of peace at Amins, theabolition of it was rC­  
peitedly and sti-or-gly pre sed by France ; and it is  
not improbable ;.t no rem to dav it will follow the  
fate of the title of “ King of&#x27; France,” so long worn  
hv the British irmnarchs, and at !e:,;th so properly  
aav, im ..1 to the lessons of a m ignauimous wisdom.  
As tar as this homage to the British Bag has any  
foundation at present, it rests merely on lo-w- usa-v‘  
and long acijmesence, which are a nstrued, ns in ;•!  
lew other cases ot ina dime claims, into the effect of  
a general though tacit convention. The sec- nd in­  
•tauce is the extension of the territorial jurisdiction to  
f.ur .eagues trom the shore. This too, as far as the  
instance may exceed that which is generally allow&#x27;d&#x27;,  
rests on a lue foundation, strengthened, perhaps, by  
t.ie local facility of smuggling, and the peculiar in­  
tcre.U which C.re.at Britain has in preventing n prac­  
tice alfectmg so deeply her whole s\ stem of revenue,  
commerce and manuf.irtures : whilst the limitation  
itseli ui l.air leagues, necessarily implies th it beyond  
that instance no territorial jurisdiction is assumed.  
  
- ‘Ciin ’i uu: VrtlUC.Ot  
..(CSCprerogatives over foreign fl-gs in one rase, and  
within I mited portion of the c seas in another, it is  
obvious that neither of them will hen lated bv the  
exemption of American vessels from impressment1  
which are no wise connected with either; having nrl  
ver been made on the pretext either of withholding  
the wmted homage to the British flag, or of smug­  
gling m defiance of British laws. “  
. 1 tlis &lt;‘xteiisu.ii (if the British law to four leagues  
trom the shore, is inferred from an act of parliament  
P &#x27;ssed m the ye.r 173d, (!) G. 2 e. 35.) the terms of  
wInch comprehend ail vessels foreign as well as Bri­  
tidi. It is possible, however, that the former are.  
constructively excepted. Should your enquiries as­  
eci, tin this to he the case, you will find yourself on  
better ground thau the concession here m &gt;de.  
With respect to the compliment paid to the British  
flag, it is also possibly that more is here conceded  
than vou may find to be necessary. After the peace  
of I7d3, this compliment was peremptorily withheld  
bv France, in spite of the remonstrances of Great  
Britain ; and it remains for your inquiry, whether  
it did not continue to lie refused, not withstanding the  
failure at Amiens to obtain from Great Britain a for­  
mal renunciation of the claim.  
From every view of the subject, it is reasonable to  
t Xpert that the exception of the narrow seas, from  
the stipulation against impressments, will not be in­  
flexibly m lintained. Should it be so, y()Ur negotiati­  
on will be at an end. The truth is, that so great a  
proportion of our trade direct and circuitous, passes  
through those channels, and such is its peculiar ex­  
posure in them to the wrong practised, that with  
such exception any remedy would be ever partial_  
And we can never consent to purchase a partial re­  
medy, by confirming a general evil, and by subject­  
ing ourselves to our own reproaches, as well as to  
those of other nations.  
Third, it appears, as well by a letter from Mr.  
Thornton, in answer to one from me, of both which  
copies are enclosed, as from conversations with Mr.  
Merry, that the facility which would be given, purti­  
cnhtrly in the British channel, bv the immunity clai­  
med for American vassels, to the escape of traitors  
and the deser tionof others whose services in time of  
war may he particularly important to an enemy,  
forms one of the pleas for the British practice of exa­  
mining American crews, and will be one of the ob­  
jections to a formal relinquishment of it.  
This plea, like all others, admits a solid and satis­  
factory reply. In the first place, if it could prevail  
at all against the neutral claim, it would authorise  
the seizure of the persons described only, and iu ves­  
sels bound to a hostile country only ; whereas the  
practice of impressing is applied to persons, few or  
any of whom are alledged to he of either description  
and to vessels whithersoever bound, even to Greatl  
Britain herself. I11 the next place, it is not only a  
preference of ,a smaller object on one side to a greater  
object on the other ; but a soenflee of right on ene  
side to expediency on the other side.

Extract of a letter Jram the becrciuty .j/\[  
Stale, to James Monroe, Esq. dated 5th r  
January, I 804, relative to im/iressmenls. *  
We consider a neutral flag, on the high [  
eas, as a safe-guard to those sailing un- v  
er it. Great Britain, on the contrary, j.  
sserts a right to search lor, and seize her  
wn subjeds; and under that cover, as \
annot but happen, arc often seized and v  
iken off, citizens of the United States,  
nd citizens or subjects of other neutral ti  
ounlries, navigating the high seas, under  
le protection of the American flag. r  
Were the rightof Great Britain, in this r,  
ase, not denied, the abuses flowing from Cl  
would justify the United States in claim- „  
»g and expecting a discontinuance of its ai  
xemise. But the right is denied, and on n  
rie best grounds. f(  
Although Great Britain has not yet a- o  
opted, in the same latitude with most u  
ther nations, the immumtes of a neu- v  
ral flag, she will not deny the general *  
recdom of the high seas, and of neutral t|  
e»»cls navigating them, with such ex- tl  
eptions only as are annexed to it by the f&lt;  
A\y of nations. She must produce then ii  
uch an exception in th« law of nations, c  
  
&gt;n favor of the right she contends for  
But in what written and received autho  
rity will she find it? In what u^age ex  
ccpt her own, will ii be found ? She wii  
find in both, that a neutral vessel doei  
not protcirl cert air) objcCls denominated  
contraband of war, including enemies  
serving in the war, nor articles going into  
a blockaded port, nor, as she has main­  
tained, and as we have not contested, ene­  
my’s property of any kind. But no  
where will she find an exception to this  
freedom ot the seas, and of neutral flags,  
which justifies the taking away of any  
person, not an enemy, in military seivice,  
found on hoard a neulial vessel.  
If treaties, British as well as others, are  
to be consulted on this suhjed, it will  
equally appear, that no countenance to  
Inc practice can he found in them. Whilst  
they admit a contraband of war, by enu­  
merating its articles, and the effe€k of a  
real blockade by defining it, in no instance  
do they affirm or imply a right in any so­  
vereign to enforce his claims to the alle­  
giance of his subjects, on b»uid neutral  
vessels on the high seas. On the contra­  
ry whenever a belligerent claim against  
persons on hoard a neutral vessel, is refer­  
red to in treaties, enemies in military ser- j  
vice alone are excepted from the general!  
mmunity of persons in that situation ;&#x27;  
uid this exception confirms the imtnuni­  
y of those who are n &gt;t included in it.  
It is not then from the law or the usage  
&gt;f nations, nor lroin ti&gt;e tenor of tieanes,  
hat any &amp;an6lion cun be derived for the  
iraclice in question. And sure y it vviii  
»ot be pretended that tile sovereignty of j  
my nation extends, in any case whu.tverj  
icyond its own dominions, and its own ;  
essel* on the high seas. Such a doctrine i  
  
voii 1.1 give us claim to al! nations, anti  
nore than any thing would counleu tnee  
he imputation of aspiring to a universal ,  
:rnpire of ihe seas. It would be the le^s !  
nimissibie too,as it would be applicable!  
0 times of peace, as well as to times of:  
T4&#x27;&#x27;, to property as well as to persons.;  
1 the law cl allegiance, which is a muni-1  
:ipal law, be in force at all on the high j  
ieas, on board foreign vessels, it must be  
,r&gt; at all limes there, as ii is within its ac* i  
tnowledgetl splicre. If the teason ulledg- j  
:tl for it lie good in time of war, namely, j  
hat the sovereign has then a right to the !  
ercice ofall his subje&amp;s, it must be good i  
l al! times, because at all times he has j  
he same right to their service. War is i  
lot the only occasion for which he may  
l’#nt their services, nor is external dan*  
;er the only danger against which their  
ervices may lie required, for his securi­  
y. Again, if the authority of a muniri­  
ial law can operate on persons in foreign  
essels on the high seas, because within  
he dominion of their sovereign they would  
e subject 10 that law, and are violating  
he law by being in that situation how  
cjct\ the inference that the authority «,f ■  
municipal law may equally be enforced, j  
ri board foreign vessels, on the high seas,  
gainst articles of property exported in  
relation of such a law, or belonging to  
he country from whirl, if w.,u i  
  
^rnl thus every commercial regulation,  
n time of peace too, us well as of war,  
vould be made obligatory on foreigners  
ltd their vessels, not only whilst within  
he dominions of the sovereign making the  
emulation, but in every sea, and at every  
hstanr.e where an armed v- ssel might  
licet with them. Another inference de*  
ervea attention. If the subjects of one  
overeign may be taken by Force from the  
C3scl3 ol another, on the high seas, the  
ight of taking them when found, implies  
lie right of searching for them : a \exa­  
ion of commerce, especially in time of  
•eace, which has not yet been attempted,  
nd which for that as well as o&#x27;her rea  
ons, may be regarded as contradicting  
he principle from which it would flow.  
Taking reason and justice for the trsis  
f this prafitice, it is peculiarly imkfm-1  
ihle; because it deprives (lie dearest  
ighls of persons of a regular trial, to  
diich the most inconsiderable article of  
roperty captured on the high seas, is cn­  
tled ; and leaves their destiny to the  
&#x27;ill of an officer, sometimes cruel, often  
(norant, and genrally intetested by his  
ant ol mariners, in his own decisions.  
Vhenever property found in * neutral  
fssel, is supposed to be liable on any  
rounds to capture and condemnation, .  
te rule in all cases is that the question  
tall not hr decided by the capiot,1&gt;ut be &gt; &lt;  
trried before a legal tribunal, tvheic a 1 &lt;  
■gnlar trial may be had, and where the i  
iptor himself is liable to damages, for \
1 abuse of his power. Can it be reason­  
jle then,or just, thul a belligerent coin-1  
lander who is thus restricted, and thus  
ispynsible in a came of mere property  
F trivial amount should be permitted,  
ithout recurring to any tribunal wbate­  
:r, to examine the crew of a neutral ves­  
:l, to dec de the important question ol  
leir respective allegiances and to cariy  
ist decision into instant execution, by  
ireing every individual he m»y cliuse  
ito a service abhorrent to his feelings,  
utting Hun off from his most tender i  
  
./connexions, exposing his mind and his  
* person to the most humiliating discipline*  
• and his life itself to the greatest dangers f  
I /^Reason, justice and humanity unite m  
protesting against so extravagant a pro­  
ceeding. And what is the pretext for it ?  
It is that the similarity of language and  
of features between Americin citizens  
and British subjeXs, are such as not ea­  
sily to be distinguished ; and that without  
this arbitrary and summary authority to  
make the distinXion, British subjeXs  
would escape, under the name of Ame- |  
rican citizens, from the duty which they  
owe to their sovereign. Is then the dif­  
ficulty of distinguishing a mariner of one  
.country from the mariner of the other*  
and the importance of his services, a  
j good plea for referring the question wlie­  
I ther lie belongs to the one or to the olner*  
to an arbitrary decision on the spot, by  
an interested and uttresppnsibie e&amp;ecr ?  
In all other cases, the difficulty and the  
importance of question are considered  
as reasons for requiring greater care and  
IbriTiiilily in investigating them, k great­  
er security for a right decision on them*  
I o say that precautions of this sort are  
incompatible with the objeX, is to admit  
th.it Hie objeX is unjustifiable, since the  
oi.lv means by which it can fie pursed

1 he ev.l takes a deeper die, when  
viewed in its praXicc as well us its prin­  
ciples. ere it allowable that iittlish  
subjeXs should be taken out or American  
vessels pn the high seas, ir might at least  
be required that the proof of their alle­  
eiance should ii» ■ ■ .  
  
This obvious and just rule is, however,  
reversed ; and evciy seaman on boaid,  
‘bough going from an American port, and  
sailing under the American flag, and  
sometimes even speaking an idiom prov­  
ing him not to lie a British subject, is  
presumed lobe such, unless shewn lo be  
American citizen. It may safely be af­  
firmed that this is an outrage and zu in­  
dignity which has no picccdent, and  
wlnco C.icat Britain would be among the. •  
last nations in the world to suffer, u 0f­  
hred to her own stdijccls’, and her own  
fug. iHor is it always against tJie riv--iit  
presumption alone, which is in favor of  
&#x27;he c^wnahip conesponding with the  
‘hat the violence is committed. Not  
uofrerpiently it lakes j I ice in defiance of  
the most positive proof, certified in due  
.orm by an Aineiieun officer. I^t jt „ot  
be said, that in granting ,o American  
seamen this protection for their rights as  
such, the point is yielded, that the proof  
lies on the American side, and that the  
want of u in the pi.scriUd fmm ju,tifiep  
the inference that the seamen is not of  
American allegiance. It i, disiinfilly to  
be understood, that the certificate usually  
called a protection lo American seamen,  
is not meant to protea them under their  
own or even any other neutral flag o„  
the h’gh sea*. VVc can never admitfthat  
in such a situation, any other protection  
!f rt (lu,re^ for them, than the neutral flag  
itsell on the high seas. The document  
is given to prove their real charter, in  
situations to which neither the taw of na­  
tions, nor the law of their own country,  
aie app.icable ; in other words, to protect  
them within fht- _r . ...  
  
tish law, and to secure to U,*m, udthim  
every other jurisdiction, the rights and  
immunites due to them. If mtl.ecou.se  
of their navigation even on the high * cas  
the document should have thc t fieft of  
repelling wrongs of any sort, it is an in­  
cidental advantage only, of which they  
avail themselves, and is by no means ,o  
be misconstrued into a right to exatf such  
a proof, or to make any disadvantageous  
interference from the want of it.  
Were it even admitted that certificates  
for protection might be justly required  
II time of war, from American seame n,  
they could only be requited in ca*es  
where the lapse of time from its com­  
mencement, had given an opportunity  
lor the American seam,,, to provide  
themselves will, such a document. Yet  
;l is certain that in a variety of instances

Although tfi.v iiiv.y have been settled and  
roareied, and mu naturalised in the U. i  
States, she constantly refuses to release,  
from hrr’s American citizen* impressed j  
into it, whenever shecsn give for a rea­  
son, that they were either set&#x27;led or mar­  
ried within her dominions. Thus, when  
the voluntary consent of the individual fa*  
vors her pretensions, she pleads the vali­  
dity of that consent. When the volun.  
tary consent of the individual stands in the  
way of her pretensions, it goes for no­  
thing! When marriage or residence can  
. be pleaded in her favor, she avails herself  
of the pica. When marriage and resi.  
der.ee, and even naturalization are against  
her no respeCl w hatevev is paid to either!  
She takes by force herown subjeC\s, vo  
kwuarily serving in our vessels. She  
keeps by force American citizsns, invo  
lyntarily serving in hers. More flagrant ■  
inconsistencies cannot be imagined.  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives  
which ought lobe felt by-the British go­  
vernment to relinquish a praCVice which  
exposes it to so many reproaches, it is  
foreseen that objections of different sorts  
w ill he pressed on you—You will be told  
first,M the great number of British sea­  
men in the Am.-rican tiade, and of tire  
rocessify for their services in time of  
war and danger. Secondly, of the right  
un.l lire prejudice of the British nation,  
wuh respect to what are called the Brh  
lish or narrow &lt;-eas, where its domain  
would be abandoned by the general 8&lt;i*  
pulation required. Thirdly, of the use  
winch would be made of such a *anC\ua­  
ry as that of Ameiican vessels, for deser­  
tions. and traitcrous communications to  
her enemies, especially across the chan­  
nel to France.  
1st. With respeCt to the British seamen  
serving in our trade.it may be rema*k«  
e&lt;i, fifiit, that the number, though con­  
siderable, is probably less than may be.  
  
supposed. Secondly, that what is wrong  
in itself cannot lie made right by const,:  
deration of expediency or advantage.  
&#x27;1 h&gt;rdly, that it is proved by the fac\,thUt  
Ujs number of leal British subjects gain­  
ed by tiic platTice in requisition, isofin­  
f-uad.erable importance, even in the  
kCulc of advantage. The annexed re­  
port to congress on the subjec\ of im­  
pressment, with the addition of suclnfca­  
se* as m .y be in the har.dsof Mr Erwitig,  
will verity the remark in its application  
to the present war.—1 he s •. &#x27;enuent made j  
by his pitdeces«or duiing the Iasi war,’  
fend which is also annexed, i&gt; in the tome I  
view s ill more conclusive. The state- !  
ment comprehends not only all the ap­  
plications made by him in the Si&#x27;s’, in  
&#x27;stance, for the liberation of impressed sea­  
men, between the month ol June, 1797,  
and Sepi 18:)I, but many also which had  
been made previous to his agency, by  
r.&#x27;ir Pinckney and Mr King, and which it  
&quot;ns neces-ia,) for him to tr.new. These  
fcjO&#x27;iic.idoMi theiffoie may fairly he con  
vhertif as c inbr.ici.ig the greater part of  
the period oi the war ; and as applications  
ice known to be pietty indiscriminately j  
made, tiity m &gt;y furthei be considered as !  
embracing, if not the whole, the fargrea-j  
ter part of die impressments, those of  
Britiiili subject5 as well a-, others. Yet  
the tcsuii exhibits 2.U59 cases oi.ly, anti  
«d this number !02 seamen only, detain­  
ed as bung Butisli subjects, which is less  
titan l-SO of the number impressed, and  
1.142 discharged or ordered to be so, as  
»iol being British subjects, which is more  
than hail’of the whole number—leaving  
feui lor lurlher proof, with the stronger.  
r» esuinnticn that &#x27;.he greater part, ii not  
the whole, were Americans or other ali­  
ens, whose proof t;l citizenship had been  
lost or ue.Mioycd, or whose situation  
would account for the difficulties and d*  
1 »ys in pi uducing it. bo that it is certain  
  
&gt;‘&gt;ui o; ail ;ne uiinsh seamen gained by  
il&gt;m violent proceeding, more than an e­  
tjoal number who were not ao were the  
Vitlims ; it io highly probable that for e­  
Vtry ihiu-.ii seaman so gained,a number  
of otl.cis, less than ten for one, must  
have been the victims, and it is even pos­  
s.b e that this number may have exceed­  
ed the ptopoilion of twenty to one.  
It cannot therefore be doubted that the  
acquisition of British seamen by these  
imptessmeitU. whatever maf he its ad­  
vantage, is iost in the wrong done to A­  
ineileans ignorantly or wilfully mistaken  
lot British suhjctfls, in the jealousy arid ill  
Will excited among all the niaiitimu na­  
tiortl by an t dneiei.ee to such a practice,  
and in the particular prov&#x27; cation to mea­  
sures o! redress on the part nt the Uni  
ted States, not less disagreeable to them  
than embarrassing to (.ireal Britain, and  
w hich rn..y ihi eaten the good understan­  
ding winch ought to be taitnfully culti­  
vated by both. The copy of a bill bro’l  
into congress under the influence of vio­  
lations committed on our flag, gives force  
to this latter consideration. Whether it  
will pass into a law and at the present  
session, is more than can yet he said. As  
there is every reason to hsheve that it  
has been proposed with teiullance. it will  
piobsbly not be pm sued iu o iffvcl, if any  
hope can be supported of a remedy by  
an amicable arrangement between the  
two nations.  
There is r further consideration which  
ought to have weight in this question.  
Although tiie British seamen employed  
in can)mg on American commence, be j  
in some respects lost to their own nati- ,  
on yet such is the unirna oaud extensive j  
&lt; i.nnvxion ol tins roinmetce, diret! and  
ciicaitous, with the rrrnn.eice, the ina-1  
i i laCtuie-, revenue, and the general re 1  
•oiiir.es oi he British nation ih.,( in other  
ri .j.cct, its ntaiincraon beard American j  
  
vessels, may only be said to be tendering  
•t the most valuable services- It would  
not be extravagant to make a question,  
whether Great Britain would not suffer  
more by withdrawing her seamen from  
the merchant vessels of the U. S. than  
her enemies would setter from the addi­  
tion of them to the crews of her ships ol  
war and cruizers.  
Should any difficulty be started con  
ccrning seamen born within the British  
dominions, and naturalized by the U. S.  
since the treaty of 1783, you may re­  
move it by observing: First, that very  
few if any such natutalizations can take  
place, the law here requiring a preparato­  
ry residence of fire years, with notice ol  
the intention to become a citizen entered  
on record two years before the last neces­  
sary formality, besides a regular proof ol  
good moral character, conditions little  
likely to be complied wi*h by’ ordinary ser  
faring persons. Secondly, that a discon­  
tinuance of impressments on the high  
seas will preclude an actual coalition be  
tween the interfering claims. Within  
the jurisdiction %fcach nation, and their  
respective vessels on the high seas, each  
will enforce the allegiance which it claims.  
In other situations the individuals doubly  
claimed, will bo within a jurisdiction in­  
dependent of both nations.  
Secondly, The British pretensions to  
domain over ike narrow seas are so obso­  
lete and so indefensible, that they never  
| would have occurred as a probable objee­  
I tion in this case, if they had not actually  
frustrated an arrangement settled by Mr.  
| K;ng with the British ministry on the  
subject of impressments from American  
I vessel# on the high sea». At the mo  
men: when the articles were expected to  
be signed, and an exception of tho nar»  
row seas was urged and insisted on by  
i St. Vincent; and being utterly inad­  
jpv.ssible on our part, the negociation was  
jsibaitdone&#x27;d.  
1. Tk„ a:_• . . .  
  
r* “ mi iit&gt;uii ii«^ ^criamijr ntc  
[ ihe slightest foundation. The lime has  
been, indeed, when England not only  
claimed,but exercised pretension* scarce­  
ly inferior to full sovereignty over the  
seas surrounding the British isles, and e­  
&#x27; ven ns far as Cap* Finisterre to the south,  
and Van Staten, in Norway, to the north.  
It was a time, however, when reason had  
little share in determining the law, and  
the intercourse of nations; when power  
alone decided questions of right, and  
when the ignorance and want of concert  
among other maritime countries facilitat­  
ed such an usurpation. I he progress of  
civilia *icn and information has produced  
a change in all thssr respeds, and no  
principle in the code of public law is at  
present better established, than the coin­  
mon freedom of the seas beyond a very  
limit&#x27;rd distance from the territories wash­  
ed by them. This distance is not, indeed,  
wxed with absolute precision. It is vari­  
ed in a small degree by written authori­  
ties, and perhaps it may be reasonably  
varied in some degree by local peculi­  
critics. But the greatest distance which  
would now he listened to any where,  
would moke a small proportion of the nar­  
rowest part of the narrowest seas in ques­  
tion. 1  
What are, in faft, the prerogatives  
Claimed and exercised by Great Britain  
over these seas ? If they were really a  
part of her domain, her authority wauld  
be the same there, as within her  
other domain. Foreign vessels would  
be subjea to all the laws and regu­  
lations framed lor them, as much as if  
they were within the harbors or rivers of  
the country. Nothing of this sort is pre.  
tended. Nothing of this sort would be  
tolerated. The only instances in which  
ihese seas are distinguished from ml.nr  
  
seas, or in winch Great Britain enjoys  
within them, any dislinfitton over other  
nations are first, the compliment paid by  
other flags to liars. ScccocJly, the exten­  
sion of her ten Kona! jni isdiCliou in cer­  
tain cases to the distance of four leagues  
from the coast.—This first is a relic of  
ancient usurpation, which has thus long i  
escaped the corre&amp;ion which modern and i  
mote enlightened times have applied to  
other usurpations. The prerogative has  
been often contested, however, even at  
the expense of bloody wars, and is still  
home withill will nnd impatience by her  
neighbors. At the last treaty of peace  
at Amiens, the abolition of it was repeat­  
edly and strongly pressed by France ; and  
it li. not improbable that at no remote day  
it will follow the fate of the title of “ King  
or France,” s &gt; long worn by the British  
monarch*, and at length so properly ta­  
ct ificed to the lessons of a magnanimous  
wisdom. A» far a* this homage to the  
British flag ha* any foundation at pre­  
sent, it rests merely on long usage and  
long acquaintance, .which are construed,  
as in a few other cases of maritime  
claims into the efFeCl of a general though  
tacit convention. 1I he second instance  
.s the extension of the territorial juris­  
diction to four leagues from the share.  
1 his, too, as far as the distance may  
exceed that which is generally allowed,  
rests on a like foundation, strengthened  
perhaps, by the local facility of smug­  
gling, and the peculiar interest whic*h  
Great Britain has in preventing a prac­  
tice of affecting so deeply her whole  
sys&#x27;em of revenue, commerce and ms­  
nufacWts; whilst the limitation itself  
to 4 leagues necesaiily implies that be­  
yond that distance no territorial jurisdic­  
tion is assumed.  
But whatever may be the origin or the  
value of these prerogatives over foreign  
fiags in one cate, and within a limtttcU  
portion of these seas in another, it is ob­  
vious that neither of them will be vio­  
lalcd by the cx.inption of Atnericau yt«J  
  
I -els from impressments which are no  
j wise connected with either ; having n­  
! ver hren made on the pretext cither of  
i withholding the wonted homage to the  
• Bi uish flag or of smuggling in defiance  
oi British laws,  
j This extension of the Rritish law to  
i ft&gt;ur leagues from the shore, is inferred  
| irons an aCl of parliament passed in the  
(year 1736 (9 G. 3 c. 35) the term of  
which comprehend all vessels foreign as  
well as British. It is possible however,  
that the former are constructively ex­  
empted. Should your enquiries ascer­  
tain this to be the case you will find your­  
self on better ground than the concession  
here made.  
With respeCt to the compliment paid  
to the British flag, it is also possible that  
more is hera conceded than you may  
find to be necessary. After the peace  
of 1783 this compliment was peremptori­  
ly withheld by France, in spite of the re­  
monstrances of Great Britain ;and it ro­  
mains for your enquiry, whether it did not  
continue to be rat&#x27;uscd, notwithstanding  
the failure at Amiens to obtain from Great  
Britain a formal renunciation ofthe claim.  
From every view of the subject, it is  
reasonable to expect that the exception  
of the na row seas, from the stipula’io.i  
against impressments, will not be inflexi­  
bly maintained- Should it be so, your ne­  
gociatian will be a: an end. The t:u:h  
is, that bo great a proportion ofour trade  
direCI and circuitous, passes through those  
channels, and such is its peculiar expo  
sure in them to the wrong praftiied,  
that with such exception any remedy  
would be very partial. And we can ne­  
ver consent to purchase a partial remedy,,  
by confirming a general evil and by sub­  
jecting ourselves to our own reproaches, i  
as well as to those or other nations.  
Third, It appears as well by a Icfer  
i from Mr. Thornton, in answer to one I  
  
irom me, oi both which copies are enclo.  
sed, as from conversations with Mr. Mer­  
ry, that tlie facility which would be 51  
ven, particularly in the British channel,  
by the immunity.claimed for American  
vessels, to the escape of traitors, hum the  
desertion of others whose services in time  
of war may be particularly important to;  
an enemy, forms one of the picas Tor the  
British practice of examining American •  
crews, and will be one of the objections i  
to a formal relinquishment cf it.  
This pUa, like all others admits a so­  
lid and satisfactory reply. In the first &#x27;  
place, if it could prevail at all against the |  
neutral claim, it would authorise tha sei.  
zure of the persons described only, and in  
vessels bound to a hostile country only ;  
whereas the pra£lica ol impressing is ap­  
plied to persons, few or any of whom arc j  
alledgcd to be of either descriptions, and  
to vessels whithersoever bound, even to  
Great Brituin herself. In the next place,  
; it is not only a preference of a srn«llcr ob­  
jeft on one side to a greater objefl on the  
other ; but a sacrifice of right on one to  
expediency on the other side.

WE confidera neutrai flag, on the high feas, as a fafeguard to thofe  
failing under it. Great Britain, on the contrary, afferts a right to fearch for,  
and feize her own fubjects ; and under that cover, as cannot but happen, are  
often feized and taken off, citizens of the United Stats, and citizens or fub-  
jects of other neutral countries, navigating the high feas, under the protec-  
tion of the American flag.  
  
Were the right of Great Britain, in this cafe, not denied, the abufes flow-  
ing from it would juftify the United States in claiming and expecting a dif-  
continuance of its exercife. But the right is denied, and on the beft grounds.  
  
Although Great Britian has not yet adopted, in the fame latitude with moft  
other nations, the immunities of a neutral flag, fhe will not deny the general  
freedom of the high feas, and of neutral veffels navigating them, with fuch  
exceptions only as are annexed to it by the law of nations. She muft pro-  
duce then fuch an exception in the law of nations, in favour of the right fhe  
contends for. But in what written and received authority will the find it ?  
In what ufage except her own will it be found? She will find in both, that a  
neutral vefiel does not protec certain objects denominated contraband of  
war, including enemies ferving in the war, nor articles going into a blockaded  
port, nor as fhe has maintained, and as we have not contefted, enemy’s pro-  
perty of any kind. But no where will the find an exception to this freedom  
of the feas, and of neutral flags, which juftifies the taking away of any per-

them. Whilft they admit a contraband of war, by enumerating its articles,  
and the effect of a real blockade by defining it, in no inftance do they affirm  
or imply a right in any fovereign to enforce his claims to the allegiance of  
his fubjects, on board neutral veffels on the high feas. On the contrary,  
whenever a belligerent claim againft perfons on board a neutral veffel, is re-  
ferred to im treaties, enemies in military fervice alone are excepted from the  
general tmmunity of perfons in that fituation ; and this exception confirms  
the immunity of thofe who are not included in it.  
  
It is not then from the law or the ufage of nations, nor from the tenor of  
treaties, that any fanction can be derived for the practice in queition. And  
furely it will not be pretended that the fovereignty of any nation extends, in  
any cafe whatever, beyond its own dominions, and its own veffels on the high  
feas.. Such a doctrine would give juft claim to all nations, and more than  
any thing would countenance the imputation of afpiring to an univerfal em-  
pire of the feas. It would be the lefs admiffible too, as it would be applica-  
ble to times of peace, as well as totimes of war, and to property as well as to  
perions. If the law of allegiance, which is a municipal law, be in force at all on  
the high feas, on board foreign veffels, it muft be fo at all times there, as it is  
within its acknowledged fphere. If the reafon alleged for it be good in time  
of war, namely, that the fovereign has then a right to the fervice of all his  
fubjects, it muft be good at all times, becaufe at all times, he has the fame  
  
tight to their fervice. Waris not the only occafion for which he may want  
their fervices, nor is external danger the only danger againft which their fer-  
vices may be required for his fecurity. Again; if the authority of a muni-  
ctpal law can operate on perfons in foreign veffels on the high feas, becaufe  
within the dominion of their fovereign, they would be fubjeé&amp; to that law,  
and are violating that law by being in that fituation, how reject the inference  
that the authority of a municipal law may equally be enforced, on board for-  
eign vefiels, on the high feas, againft articles of property exported in vielation  
of fuch a law, or belonging to the country from which it was exported ? And  
thus every commercial regulation, in time of peace too, as well as of war,  
wouid be made obligatory on foreigners and their vefiels, not only whilft  
within the dominion of the fovereign making the regulation, but in every fea,  
and at every diftance where an armed veffel might meet with them. Another  
inference deferves attention. Ifthe fubjccts of one fovereign may be taken  
by force from the veffels of another, on the high feas, the right of taking  
them when found, implies the right of fearching for them ; a vexation of  
commerce, efpecially in time of peace, which has not yet been attempted,  
and which for that as well as other reafons, may be regarded as nontinadlion  
the principle from which it would flow.  
  
Taking reafon and juftice for the tefts of this practic e, it is peculiarly  
indefenfible ; becaufe it deprives the deareft rights of perfons of a regular  
trial, to which the moft inconfiderable article of property captured on the  
high feas is entitled ; and leaves their deftiny to the will of an officer, fome-  
times cruel, often ignorant, and generally interefted by his want of mariners,  
in his own decifions. Whenever property found m a neutral veffel is fup-  
pofed to be lable on any grounds to capture and condemnation, the rule in  
all cafes is that the queftion fhall not be decided by the captor, but be carried  
before a legal tribunal, where a regular trial may be bad, and where the  
captor himiclfis liable to damages, for an abuie of his power. Cam it be  
reafonable then, or juit, that a belligerent commander who is thus retlrict-  
ed, and thus refponfible in a cafe of mere property of trivial amount, fhould  
be permitted, without recurring to any tribunal whatever, to examine the  
crew of a neutral veffel, to decide the important queftion of their refpective  
allegiances, and to carry that decifion into inftant execution, by forcing every  
individual he may chnofe, into a fervice abhorrent to his feelings, cutting him  
off from his moft tender connections, expofing his mind and his perfon to the  
moft humiliating difcipline, and his life itlelf to the greateft dangers ? Reafon,

And what isthe pretext for it ? It is that the fimilarity of language and of  
features between American citizens and Britith fubjeéts, are fach as not eafily  
to be diftinguifhed ; and that without this arbitrary and fummary authority  
to make the diftinction, Britifh fubje&amp;ts would efcape, under the name of  
American citizens, from the duty which they owe to their fovereign. 33 then  
the difficulty of diftinguifhing a mariner of one country from the mariner of  
the other, and the importance of his fervices, a good plea for referring the  
queftion whether be belongs to the one or to the other, to an arbitrary deci-  
fion on the the fpot, by an interefted and unrefponfible officer ? In all other  
cafes, the difficulty and the importance of queftions are confidered as reafons  
for requiring greater care and formality in inveftigating them, and greater  
fecurity fora right decifion of them. To fay that precautions of this fort  
are incompatible with the object, is to admit that the object is unjuftifiable 5  
fince the only means by which it can be purfued are fuch as cannot be  
juftified. 3  
The evil takes a deeper die, when viewed in its practice as well as tts prin-  
ciples. Were it allowable that Britith fubjects fhould be taken out of Ameri-  
can veffels on the high éeas, it might at leaft be required that the proot of  
their allegiance fhould lie on the Britifh fide. This obvious and juft rule is,  
however, reverfed ; and every feaman on board, though going from an Ameni-  
can port, and failing under the American flag, and fometimes even. {peaking  
an idiom preving him not to be a Britifh fubject, is prefumed to be fuch, unlefs  
fhewn to be aw American citizen. It may fafely be affirmed that this is an  
outrage and an indignity which has no precedent, and wich Great Britain  
would be among the laft nations inthe world-to fuffer, if offered to her own  
fubjects, and her own flag. Nor is it always againit the right prefumption  
alone which is in favour of the citizenfhip correfponding with the flag, that  
the violence is committed. Not unfrequently it takes place in. defiance of  
the moft pofitive proof, certified in due torm by an. American officer. ; Let it  
not be faid, that, in granting to American feamen this protection for their  
rights as fuch, the point is yielded, that the proof lies on the American fides  
and that the want of it in the prefcribed form juftifies the inference that the  
feamen is not af American allegiance. It is diftinétly te be wnderitood, that  
the certificate, ufually calbed a protection to American feamen, is Not meant  
to protect tham under their own, or even any other neutral flag on the high  
feas, We can never admit, that in fuch a fituation, any other protection is  
required for thera, than the neutral flag itfelf on the high feas. . The docu-  
ment is givea to prove their real character, in fituations to which neither the law  
of nations, nor the law of their own country, are applicable ; im other words,  
to protect them within the jurifdiction of the Britith laws, and to. feeure to  
them, within every other jurifdidion the rights and immunities due te  
them. If, ia the courle of their navigation even on the high feas, the docu-  
ment fhould have the effect of repelling wrongs of any fort, it is an inciden-  
tal advantage only, of which they avail themfelves, and is by no means to be  
&#x27; mifcoaftrued into a right toexadt fuch a preof, or to make any difadvanta-  
geous inference from the want of it,  
  
Were it even admitted that certificates fer protection might be juftly re-  
quired in time of war from American feamten, they could only de required  
iu cafes where the lapfe of time from its commencement had given an oppor-  
tunity for the American feamen to provide themfelves with fuch a document.  
Yet it is certain, that, in a variety of inftances, feamen kave been imprefled  
from American veffels, on the plea that they had not this proof of citizen-  
thip, when the dates and places of the impreffments demonftrated the im-  
poflibiliiy of their knowing, in time to provide the proof, that a ftate of war  
had rendered it nece lary.  
  
Whether, therefore, we confult the law of nations, the tenor of treaties, or  
  
the dictates of reafon and juitice, no warrant, no pretext can be found for the

Britifh practice of making impreffments from American veffels on the high feas.  
  
Great-Britain has the lefs to fay in excufe for this practice, as it is in dire&amp;  
contradiction to the principles on which fhe proceeds in other cafes. Whiltt  
fhe claims and feizes on the high feas, her own fubjeéts, voluntarily ferving in  
American veffels, fhe has conftantly given, when fhe could give, as areafon  
for not difcharging from her fervice American citizens, that they had volun-  
tarily engaged in it. Nay, morc, whilft fhe impreffes her own fubjects from  
the American fervice, although they may have been fettled and married, and  
even naturalifed in the United States, fhe conftantly refufes to releafe from  
her’s, American citizens impreffed into it, whenever fhe can give for a reafon,  
that they were either fettled or married within her dominions. Thus, when  
the voluntary confent of the individual favours her pretenfions, fhe pleads the  
validity of that confent. When the voluntary confent of the individual ftands  
in the way of her pretenfions, it goes for nothing! When marriage or refi-  
dence can be pleaded in her favour, fhe avails herfelf of the plea. When  
marriage and refidence, and even naturalization are againft her, no refpecé  
whatever is paid to either! She takes by force her own fubjeéts, voluntarily  
ferving in our veffels ; fhe keeps by force American citizens, involuntarily  
ferving in hers. More flagrant inconfiftencies cannot be imagined.  
  
Notwithftanding the powerful motives which ought to be felt by the Britith  
government to relinquifh a practice which expofes it to fo many reproaches,  
it is foreieen that objections of different forts will be preffed on you. You  
will be told firft, of the great number of Britith feamenin the American trade,  
and of the neceffity for their fervices in time of war and danger. Secondly,  
of the right and the prejudice of the Britifh nation, with refpeét to what are  
called the Britifh or narrow feas, where its domain would be abandoned by  
the general ftipulation required. Thirdly, of the ufe which would be made  
of fuch a fanctuary as that of American veffels, for defertions, and traitorous  
communications to her enemies, efpecially acrofs the channel to France.  
  
rft. With refpect to the Britifh feamen ferving in our trade, it may be re-  
marked, firft, that the number, though confiderable, is probably lefs than ma  
be fuppofed. Secondly, that what is wrong in itfelf cannot be made right by  
confiderations of expediency or advantage. ‘Thirdly, that it is proved by the  
fact, that the number of real Britifh tubjeéts gained by the practice in quef-  
tion, is of inconfiderable importance, even in the feale of advantage. The  
annexed report to congrefs on the fubject of imprefiments, with the addition  
of fuch cafes as may be inthe hands of Mr. Erving, will verify the remark  
in its application to the prefent war. The ftatement made by his predeceffor  
during the laft war, and which is alfo annexed, is in the fame view ftill more  
conclufive. The ftatement comprehends not only all the applications made  
by him in the firft inftance, for the liberation of impreffed feamen, between  
the month of June, 1797, and September, 1801, but many alfo which had  
been made previous to this agency by Mr. Pinckney and Mr. King, and  
which it was neceffary for him to renew. Thefe applications therefore may  
fairly be confidered as embracing the greater part of the period of the war ;  
and as applications are known to be pretty indifcriminately made, they may  
further be confidered as embracing, if not the whole, the far greater part of  
the impreffments, thofe of Britifla fubjects as well as others. Yet the refult  
exhibits 2,059 cafes only, and of this number 102 feamen only, detained as  
being Britith fubje&amp;s, which is lefs than 1-20th of the number impreffed, and  
¥,142 difcharged or ordered to be fo, as not being Britith fubjeéts, which is  
more than half of the whole number, leaving 805 for further proof, with the  
ftrongeft prefumption that the greater part, if not the whole, were Americans  
or other aliens, whofe proof of citizenfhip had been loft or deflroyed, or  
whofe fituation would account for the difficulties and delays in producing it.  
So that it is certain, that for all the Britifh feamen gained by this violent pro-  
ceeding, more than an equal number who were not fo were the victims ; it  
is highly probable that for every Britifh feaman fo gained, a uumber of oth-

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS. 37  
  
ers, lefs than ro for one, muft have been the victims, and it is even poffible  
that this number may have exceeded the proportion of 20 to one.  
  
it cannot therefore be doubted, that the acquifition of Britifh feamen by  
thefe impreffments, whatever may be its advantage, is loft in the wrong done  
to Americans ignorantly or wilfully miftaken for Britifh fubjeGs, in the jeal-  
oufy and ill-will excited among all maritime nations by an adherence to fuch  
a practice, and in the particular provocation to meafures of redrefs on the  
part of the United States, not lets difagreeable to them, than embarrafling to  
Great-Britain, and which may threaten the good underftanding which ought  
to be faithfully cultivated by both. The copy of a bill brought into Con-  
grefs under the influence of violations committed on our flag, gives force to  
this latter confideration.. Whether it will pafs into a law, and at the prefent  
feffion, is more than can yet be faid. As there is every reafon to believe that  
it has been propofed with reluctance, it will probably not be purfued into ef-  
fect, if any hope can be fupported of a remedy, by an amicable arrangement  
between the two nations.  
  
There isa further confideration which out to have weight in this queftion.  
Although the Britifh feamen employed in carrying on American commerce,  
be in fome refpects loft to their own nation, yet fuch is the intimate and ex-  
tenfive connection of this commerce, direét and circuitous, with the com-  
merce, the manufactures, the revenue and the general refources of the Britifh  
nation, that in other refpeéts its mariners, on board American veffels, may  
truly be faid to be rendering it the moft valuable fervices. It would not be  
extravagant to make it a queftion, whether Great Britain would not fuffer  
more by withdrawing her feamen from the merchant vefiels of the United  
States, than her enemies would fuffer from the addition of them to the crews  
of her fhips of war and cruifers.  
  
Should any difficulty be ftarted concerning feamen born within the Britifh  
dominions, and naturalized by the United States fince the treaty of 1783, you  
may remove it by obferving : Firft, that very few, if any, fuch naturaliza-  
tions can take place, the law here requiring a preparatory refidence of five  
years, with notice of the intention to become a citizen entered of record two  
years before the laft neceffary formality, befides a regular proof of good mor-  
al character, conditions little likely to be complied with by ordinary fea-far-  
ing perfons. Secondly, that a difcontinuance of imprefiments on the high  
feas will preclude an actual collifion between the interfering claims. Within  
the jurifdiétion of each nation, and in their refpective veffels on the high feas,  
each will enforce the allegiance which it claims. In other fituations the  
individuals doubly claimed, will be within a jurifdiction independent of both  
nations.  
  
Secondly. The Britith pretenfions to domain over the narrow feas are fo  
odiolete, and fo indefenfible, that they never would have occurred as a pro-  
bable objeétion in this cafe, if they had not actually fruftrated an arrangement  
iettled by Mr. King with the Britifh miniftry on the fubje&amp;t of imprefiments  
irom American vefiels on the high feas. At the moment when the articles  
were expected to be figned, an exception of the “ narrow feas” was urged  
and infifted on by lerd St. Vincent ; and being utterly inadmiffible on our  
part, the negociation was abandoned.  
  
The objection in itfelf has certainly not the flighteft foundation. The time  
has been, indeed, when England not only claimed, but exercifed pretenfions  
‘carcely inferiour to full fovereignty over the feas furrounding the Britifh  
ilies, and even as far as Cape Fintfterre to tke fouth, and Van Staten, in Nor-  
way, tothe north, It wasa time, however, when reafon had little thare in  
determining the law, and the intercourfe of nations ; when power alone de-  
cided queftions of right, and, when the ignorance and want of concert  
among other maritime countries facilitated fuch an ufurpation. The progrefs  
ot civilization and information has produced a change in all thofe refpeéts, and  
20 principle in the code of publick law, is at prefent better eftablifhed, than

the common freedom of the feas beyond a very limited diftance from the  
territories wafhed by them. This diftance is not, indeed, fixed with abfolute  
precifion. It is varied in a {mall degree by written authorities, and perhaps  
it may be reafonably varied in fome degree by local peculiarities. But the  
greateft diftance which would now be liftened to any where, would make a  
imall proportion of the narroweft part of the narroweft feas in queftion.  
  
What are, in fact, the prerogatives claimed and exercifed by Great Britain  
over thefe feas? If they were really a part of her domain, her authority  
would be the fame there as within her other domain. Foreign veffels would  
be fubjeé&amp; to all the laws and regulations framed for them, as much as if they  
were within the harbours or rivers of the country. Nothing of this fort js  
pretended. Nothing of this tort would be tolerated. The only inftances in  
which thefe feas are diftinguifhed from cther fcas, or in which Great Britain  
enjoys within them, any diftinction over other nations, are, firft, the compli-  
ment paid by other flags to her’s. Secondly, the extenfion of her territorial  
jurifdiction in certain cafes to the diftance of four leagues from the coaft. The  
firft is a relick of ancient ufurpation, which has thus long efcaped the correc.  
tion, which modern and more enlightened times have applied to other ufur.  
pations. The prerogative has been often contefted, however, even at the cx.  
penfe of bloody wars, ard is ftill borne with ill will and impatience by her  
neighbours. At the. laft treaty of peace at Amiens, the abolition of it was  
repeatediy and ftrongly preffed by France ; and it is not improbable, that at  
no remote day it will follow the fate of the title of “ King of France,’’ fo  
Jong worn by the Britith monarchs, and at length fo properly facriticed to  
the teffons of a magnanimous wifdom. As far as this homage to the Britif  
flag has any foundation at prefent, it refts merely on long ufage and long ac-  
  
uiefcence, which are conftrued, asin a few other cafes of maritime claims,  
into the effect of a general though tacit convention. The fecond inftance is  
the extenfion of the territorial jurifdidtion to four leagues from the fhore.  
This too, as far as the diftance may exceed that which is generally allowed,  
reftson a like foundation, ftrengthened, perhaps, by the local facility of  
fmuggling, and the peculiar intereft which Great Britain has in preventing a  
practice affecting fo deeply her whole fyftem of revenue, commerce, and  
manufactures : whilft the limitation itfelf to four leagues, neceffarily implics,  
that beyond that diftance no territorial jurifdiction is affumed.  
  
But whatever may be the origin or the value of thefle prerogatives over  
foreign flags in one cafe, and within a limited portion of thefe feas in another,  
it is obvious that neither of them will be violated by the exemption of A-  
merican veffels ftom imprefiments, which are no wile connected with either;  
having never been made onthe pretext either of withholding the wonted  
homage to the Britifh flag, or of fmuggling in defiance of Britifh laws.  
  
This extention of the Britifh law to four leagues from the fhore, is inferred  
from an act of parliament paffed in the year 1736 (9 G.2¢. 35) the terms of  
which comprehend all veffels foreign as well as Britifh. It is poflible how-  
éver, that the former are conftructively excepted. Should your inquiries 2i-  
certain this tobe the cafe, you will find yourfelf on better ground, than the  
conceffion here made.  
  
With refpcét tothe compliment paid to the Britith flag, itis alfo poffibe  
that more is here conceded than you may find to be neceffary. After the  
peace of 1783 this compliment was perempterily withheld by France,  
ipite of the remonftrances of Great Britain ; and it remains for your inqu&#x27;&#x27;ys  
whether it did not continue to be refufed, notwithftanding the failure 4  
Amiens to obtain from Great Britain a formal renunciation of the claim. —  
  
From every view of the fubjec, it is reafonable to expe&amp; that the exceptton  
  
of the narrow feas, from the ftipulation againft impreffments, will not be in-  
  
flexibly maintained. Should it be fo, your negotiation will be at an end:  
The truth is, that fo great a proportion of our trade, dire&amp; and circuitous, pafl-  
es through thofe channels, and fuch is its peculiar expofure in them to the

wrong practifed, that with fuch an exception, any remedy would be very par-  
tial. And we can never confent to purchafe a partial remedy, by confirming  
a general evil, and by fubjecting ourfelves to our »wn reproaches, as well as  
to thofe of other nations.  
  
Third, It appears, as well by a letter from Mr. Thorntorn, in anfwer to  
one from me, of both which copies are enclofed, as from converfations with  
Mr. Merry, that the facility which would be given, particularly in the Britifh  
channel, by the immunity claimed for American veffels, to the efcape of trai-  
tors, and the defertion of others whofe fervices in the time of war may be  
particularly important to an enemy, forms one of the pleas for the Britéth  
practice of examining American crews, and will be one of the objections to  
a formal relinquifhment of it.  
  
This plea, like all others, admits a folid and fatisfactory reply. In the  
firft place, if it could prevail at all againft the neutral claim, it would author-  
ive the feizure of the perfons defcribed only, and in veffels bound to a hoftile  
country only ; whereas the practice of imprefling is applied to perfons, few  
or any of whom are alleged to be of either defcription, and to veflels  
whitherfoever bound, even to Great Britain herfelf. In the next place, it is  
not only a preference of a fmaller object on one fide to a greater object on  
the other ; buta facrifice of right on one fide to expediency on the other fide.

Extrnft of a inter from the Secretary of Stole  
to James Aloe.. or, Efq. dated 3th January,  
1S04.  
We confider a neutral flag, on the high Teas,  
as a fate-guard to thole failing under it. Great  
Britain, on the contrary, aflerts aiight tofeaich  
for, and feize her own fuhjeits j and tinder  
that cover, as cannot but happen, are often  
f&#x27;eized and taken off, citizens of the United  
States, and citizens or fuhjeCls of other neu­  
tral countries, navigating the high fcas, under  
the protection ofthe American flag.  
YVere the right of Great Britain, in this cafe,  
not denied, the abufes flowing from it, would  
juftify the Ugiteri States in claiming and ex­  
pecting a difcontinuance of its exereife. But  
the right is denied, and on the belt grounds.  
Although Great Britain has not yet adopted,  
in the fame latitude with mo ft other nations,  
the immunities of a neutral flip, fhe will not  
deny the general freedom of the high fcas, and  
of neutral veflels navigating them, with fuch  
exceptions only as are annexed to it by the law  
of nations. She tnufl produce then fuch an  
exception in the law of nations, in favor ofthe  
right flic contends for. But in what written  
and received authority will (he find it ? in what  
uftge except her own, witl it be found ? She  
will find in both, that a neutral vtflel does not  
proteft certain oojedts denominated contraband  
of war, including enemies ferving in the war,  
nor articles goi g into a blockaded port, nor as J  
flii: lias maintained, and as we have not conteft­  
ed, enemies property of any kind. But no  
where will flir find an exception to this free­  
dom of the lea*, and of neutral fl igs, which  
juftifies the taking away of any ptrfon, not an  
enemy in military fervice, found on board a neu­  
tral vefTcl.  
If treaties, Britifli as well as others, are to  
be conmited on this fabjeCt, it will equally ap­  
pear, that no countenance to the practice can  
be found in them. YVhilft they admit aeon,  
traband of war, hy eimmchiting its articles, and  
the effect of a real blockade hy defining it, in  
no injtance do they affirm orimply a tight in an r  
fevereign to inforce bis claims to the allegiauce of  
htt JubjeMs, on board neutral wffels bn the high  
fens. On the contraiy, whenever a belligerent  
claim againft perfons on board a neutral vefTcl,  
is referred to in treaties; enemies In military fer­  
vice alone aie excepted from the general immu­  
nity of perfon* in that lituatiori ; and this ex­  
ception confirms the immunity of thofe who  
are not included in it.  
Ir is not then from the law or the ufage of  
mtione, nor Iroin the ti nor of the treaties, that  
any fandion can be derived for the practice in  
queflion. And fnrely it will not be pretended  
that J tic fovcrcignty of any nation, extends in  
any e.ife whatever, beyond its own dominions  
and its own &#x27;vejfels on the high Jeas. Such a  
doCtiiue would give jolt alarm lo ail nations,  
and more th in any thing would countenance  
the imputation of afpiring to an umverfal em­  
pire of the fens. It would he the lefs admlfli­  
ble too, as it would be applicable to times of  
pt-ar e, as well as to times of war, and to pro­  
perty as Weil as to perlon*. If the law of alle­  
giance, which is a municipal law, be in force at  
all on the high feas, onboard foreign veflels, it  
  
muu nr 10 at an tmirstncrc, as it is witlmi itn  
acknowledged fphrre. If the reafon alledgrd  
for it he good in time of war, namely, that the  
fovereign has tlitna right to the fervice of all  
| his fubjetis, it (tm(t be good at all time*, hr­  
canfc at all times he has the fame right totheir  
fervice. War iA not the only ( ccafion for which  
he may want their lervices, nor is external dan­  
:gerthe only danger againft which their fervice*  
I may be required, for his lecurity. Again; if  
the authority of a municipal law can operate  
on perfuns in foreign veflels on the high fea»,  
I becaufe within the dominion of their fovrreign  
they would be fubjeft to that law, and are vio­  
: lating that law by being In that fituation, how  
I reject the inference that the authority of a mu­  
: nicipal law may equally be enforced, on board  
foreign veflels, on the high feas, againft articles  
I of properly exported in violation of fuch a law,  
or belonging to the country from which it was  
exported ? and thus every commercial regula­  
tion, in time cf peace too, as well as of war,  
would be made obligatory on foreigners and  
their veflels, not only whilft within the domi­  
nion of the fovereigii malting the regulr.ion, but  
in every fea, and at every diltance where an  
armed vefl&#x27;cl might meet with them. Another  
inference deferves att« nfion. If the filhjcdti of  
onr fovtrtign may betaken by force from the  
velfels of another, on the high feas, the right  
of taking them when found, implies the ,jght  
of fearching for them, a vexation of commerce,

juftice and humanity unite in pro&#x27;.efting rgaiuft  
fb extravagant a proceeding. And what is tho  
pretext for it ? It is that the fimiiarity of Ir*i—

zens and Britifh fubjffts, are fuch as not e.thly  
  
ik. U umpuiiirc 1 ; ani tuat without this ar­  
bitrary and fumrnary authority to make the dif­  
tinflion, Brittfii fubjeCls would efcapr, under  
the name of American citizens, from thedutv  
which they owe to their fovereign. Is then the  
difficnlty of diftinguilhmg a mariner of one  
country from the mariner of the other, and  
the importance of his fervices, a good plea for  
refering the queftion whether he belongs to the  
one or to the other, to an arbitrary deeifion on  
the fpot, by an interefted and unrcfponfihle offi­  
cer ? In all other cafes, the difficulty and the  
importance of queflions are coniidered.•&#x27;&lt;1 reafons  
for requiring greater care and formality in in­  
veftig.iting them, and greater fscurtty for a  
right decision on them. To fay that precau­  
tions of this fort are incompati &gt;Ie with the ol&gt;­  
jefl is to admit the ohjecT is ui jaltifuble ; ftnee  
the only means by which it can be purfued are  
fuch as cannot be juft died.  
The evil takes a deeper die. when viewed in  
its practice as well as its principles. Were it  
allowable that Britifli fubjeCts Dion Id betaken  
out of American vrfTels on the high fen, it  
might at leall be required that the proof of their  
allegiance Ihould lie on the Biitilli tide. This  
obvious and juft rule is, however, reverted j &amp;  
every feaman on board, though going from an  
American port, and failing tinder the American  
Hag, and fermetimes even fpeaking an idiom  
proving him not to be a Britifti fuKjcCt, ispre­  
fumed to be fuch, unlefa fliewn to be an Ame­  
rican cirizen. It may fafely hr affirmed tldt  
this is an outrage at)d an indignity which has  
no precedent, and which Oreat Britain would  
be among the lafl nations in the world to fuf­  
fi-r,&#x27; if offered to her own fubjeCt?, and her own  
flag. Nor is it always ngair.lt the right prefuinp­  
tion alone, which is in favor of the citizetdliip  
correfponding with the flag, that the violence  
13 committed. Not unfrtquently it takes place  
in defiance of the mofl pofitivc proof, certified  
in due form by an American officer. Ltt it  
not be faid, that in granting to American fea­  
meri this protection for their rights as fuch, the  
point is yielded, that the , roof bes on the A­  
tnerican fide, and that the wa. of it in the  
preferihed form juftifirs the inference that the  
feamen is not of American allegiance. It is  
diftinCtly to be underftood, that the certificate  
ufnally called a protection to American feamen,  
is not meant to proteft them under their oujti9  
or even any other neutral flag on the high  
feas. VVe cannot never ad.nit, that in  
fuch a fit nation, any other protection is  
required for them, than the neutral flag itfelf  
on the high feas. The document is given to  
prove their real character, in fituations to which  
neither the law of nations, nor the law of their  
own country, are applicnb&#x27;e; in other words,  
,0 Pr°ti Ct them, within the jurifdiClion of the  
Britifh laws, and to ftcurc tc- them, within e­  
very otherjurifdiCtion, the right* and immuni­  
ties due to them. If, in the courfe of their na­  
vigation even on the high feas, the document  
fliould have the effeCt of repelling wrongs of a­  
ny fort, it is an incidental advantage only, of  
which they avail themfelvcs, and is by no means  
to be mifeonftrued into a right to • xaCt fuch  
a proof, nr to mlror*;. ,rr, .... ?. /•  
• * .. , IliiCt*  
enre from the want of it.  
Were it even ad mi ted* that certificates for  
protection might be juftly required in time of  
war, from American feamen, they could onty  
be required in cafes where the lapfe of time  
from its commencement, had given an oppor­  
tunity for the American feamen to provide  
therfife&#x27;vcB with fiicli a doenment. Yet it is  
e*itain, that in a variety of ihflanccs, feamen  
have been imprefl&#x27;ed from American vell&#x27;els, on  
the plea that they had not this proof of citizrn­  
fhip, when the dates and places of the imprefT­  
merits dcmonftrired the impoflihility of their  
knowing in time to provide tiie proof, that  
a ft its of war had rendered, it neciflary.  
Whether, therefore, we conlult the law of  
nations, the tenor of treaties, or the dictates of  
teafon and juftice, no warrant, no pretext rati  
be fruitd fur the 12 &#x27;it ijh p rail ire of making i m -  
prrffments font Jltnericun veffelt on the high  
  
Great Britain has the lefs to fiy in cxcufe fef  
this practice as it is in direct r not rad i ft ion to the  
principles, on which flip proceeds in other  
cifr*. Whilft fher claims and frizes on the high  
fea*, her own fubjefts, voluntarily ferving in  
American vtflel», (he hat conflnntly given, wlten  
flic Could give, ns rcafnn for not difrharging

whilfl (lie imprefles her own fu^jtfts from the  
American fcrvice, although they may have been  
fettled and married, mid even naturalized in  
the United States, ftie conflantly refufes to re­  
eafe trom liera, American citizens impreffied  
into if, whenever (lie ran give for a rcafon, that  
j »ltey were either fettled or married within her

i of the individual favours her pretentions, flic  
pleads the validity of that conlent. When the  
voluntary confent of the individuals Hands in  
the way of tier pretenfions, it goes for nothing f  
When marriage or refidence can be pleaded in  
her favour, flic avails heifclf of the plea. When  
marriage and refidence and even naturahzitiort  
Are againfi her, no rcf;&#x27;~cl whatever is paid to

voluntarily fervmg in our veffcls. She keeps

ought to be felt by the Hritdh government to

lft. With refpeft to the Britiflt feamcn fer­  
aring in our trade, it may be remarked, full,  
that the number, though oonfidcrable, is pro­  
bably lefs than may be fuppofed, Secondly,  
that what is wrong in itfelf cannot he made  
right by confederations of expediency or advan­  
tage, Thirdly, that it is proved by the fa£l  
that Ihe number of real British fnbjrdts gained  
by the praflice in queftion, is «f confiderablc  
importance even in the fca&#x27;e of advantage. The  
annexed report to congrefs oh the fubjedt of  
impreffment*, with the additon of fuch cafes  
as may be in the hands of Mr. Krvine, then our  
conful in London, will verify the remark, in its  
application to the prefent war. The ftaterr.cnt  
m ide hv his p-edeceflor during the !afl war,  
an- which is a!fo annexed, 19 in the fame view  
Bill more com hi five. Tie Ifatement rnmpre­  
herris not only all the applications made by  
him in the firli inftance, for the liberation of  
imprrfTYd teamen, between the month of June,  
1707, and Sept. jsot, but many aifo which  
had been made previous to this agency, by Mr.  
Pinckney and Mr. K:ng, and which it was ne­  
refTsry for him to renew. Tht fe applications  
therefore may fairly be confidercd as embracing  
the greater part of the period of the war; and  
as applications are known to he pretty indif­  
eriminately made, they may further be conti­  
dered as embracing if rot the whu&#x27;e, the far  
greater part oart of the imprefiments, thofeof  
Brdilh fubjeffs as well as others. Yet the rtfult  
  
cxninits -,05&#x27;J cale3 only, anti of this number  
TO?feamen only detained an being llritilh fub­  
jeds, which i* kfi that 219 of the number  
imprcflcd, and 1,143 difehargrd or oidercd to  
be fo, as not bring B’itfti fuhjetffs, which is  
more than half of the whole number, leasing  
805 for further proof, with the ftmngeft pre­  
emption, that the grater part, if not the whole,  
were Americans or other aliens, whofe proof of  
chizenlhip had been loft or daftroyed, or whofe  
lit nation would account for the difficulties and  
delays in producing it. So that it is certain,  
th it for all the Britifh feameti gained by this vi­  
olent proceeding, more than an equal number,  
who were not fo, were the vidima; it is higli­  
ly probable that for every Hritifh featnan fo  
gained, a number of others, lefa than 10 for  
one mull have been the vidims, and it is even  
partible that this number may have exceeded  
the proportion twenty to one.  
It cannot therefore be doubted, that the ar­  
quiiition of Britilh fcamen, by thefe impreff­  
nicnts, whattver may be its advantage, &#x27;19 loft  
in the wrong done to Americans ignorantly or  
v iifully miftaken for Brit ilia fuhjeds, in the  
jcafuufy and ill will excited among all maritime  
nations by an adherence tofuch a practice, and  
in the particular provocation to mcafures of re­  
drefi on the part of the United Stater, not Irfs  
difagrecable to them, than embarraffing to G.  
Britain, ami which may threaten the good nn­  
drrftanninp which ought to be faithfully cub  
tivated l&gt;7 both. The cony of a bill brought  
into Cnngrefs under the influence of violations  
committed on our flag, gives force to this lat­  
ter confideration. Whether it will pafs into a  
law, an ’at &#x27;he prefent feflion, 13 more than  
&lt;• m y.t K* f ::d. As there is every reafon to be­  
lieve the it has been propofed with reludtance,  
it ill prr.hablv not lie pur filed with rffedl, if  
any&#x27;1,or c m he fupported of a remedy, by an  
ami able arrangement between the two nations.  
There is a further conlbli-ration which ought  
to h.nrc weight in this queftiou. Although the  
Brilifli feamen employed in carrying on Ameri­  
can commerce, be in fome refpedls loft to their  
own nation, yet fiich is the intimate and exten­  
five connection of this commerce, direct and  
eircuitoos, with the commerce, the manufac­  
tures, the revenue and the genera! rcfources of  
the British nation, that in other refpefls it? ma­  
riners, on board American vefl&#x27;ds, may truly  
befiid to he rendering i: the rr.oft valuable fer­  
viers. It would not be extravagant to make it  
a queftion, whether Gicat B itain would not  
f iff-r more by withdrawing her feamen from  
the mcrch nit velTi Is of the United Si itcs. than  
her enemies would fufiW from the addition of  
them to the crews of her fbips of war and  
cruifrrs.  
Should any difficulty be ftarted concerning  
feamen born wHii-r tbc Hiitilh dominions, and  
natura&#x27;if-d by the United States fince the trea­  
*» &lt;&gt; *755. von in iy iciiiovc ii by o&#x27;nfervin^ ;  
lo&#x27;il, tint very few, if any, fuch naturaliz.tti­  
•ms r&lt;in take place, the law here requiring a  
preparatory rcfidence of five years, with notice  
of the intention to become a c itizen entered of  
record two years before the laft neceflary for­  
mality, h- lides a regular proof of good and mo­  
ral chamift-r, conditions little likely to be com­  
plied with by ordinary feafaring psrfons. Se­  
condly, that a difcontinuance of impreifiments  
on the high fcas will preclude an aflual collif­  
fion hetwren the interferng claims. Within  
the jurifdtiftion of each nation, and in their ref­  
p -dive veflels on the high feas, each will en­  
force the allegiance which it claims- Jh other  
fit nations th^ individuals doubly olaimed, will  
be within a jut ifditfion independent of both na­  
tions.  
  
Secondly. Th- R-iiifh pretcnfions to domain  
over tlx; narrow ft *8 are fn ubfnlete, and foin­  
xlefenfible, that theyn-vtr would have occur­  
red as a probable objection in this cafe, if they  
!n&lt;l not. a&lt;*i ita’ty fruitrated an arrangement fet­  
tled bv Mr. Kmc w^th th&#x27;’ tlritifh miniftry on  
the fuhi ■&#x27;t of impreiririents from Amrrican vtf­  
fids on the high fens. At the moment wh-n the  
articles were rxprtfh-d to he figned, an excep­  
tion of the “ narrow feas” was urgr»d and in­  
filled on hv lord St. Vincent ; and being utter­  
ly inadnvfTiblr on our part, the negociation Was  
abandon&quot;*!.  
1’he nbp .fHon in itfelf has certainly not the  
fi phtelt foundation. The time has been, in­  
tired, when Copland not only claimed, but ex­  
ere (Vd pn-tenlionn fcarcely inferior to full f&lt;&gt;.  
w reigi’ty over the fcas furrounding the Britifh  
ill s, and even as far as cape Fimftere to the  
fouth, and V in Staten, in Norway, to the  
north. It was a time, however, when reafon  
hid little fharr in determining the law, and the  
intrrcoiirfc of nations, when pow. r alone de­  
cided qneftions of riphf, and when the tfcno­  
ranee and want ot concert among other mari­  
time countries facilitated Inch an ulurpation.  
The progrefs of civilization and Information has  
produced a change in all thnfe refpetts, and no  
principle in the code of public law, is it pre­  
fent better eftablifhjd, than the codmon free­  
dom of the Teas beyond a vrry iinwted diltance  
from territories wafhed by them This diftanee  
is not indeed fixed wi»h abfolute precifion. If  
is varied in a fmall drtrrec by written authori­  
ties, and perhaps it rruy he re.ifonah’y varied  
in fcme degree by local peculiarities. But the  
greateft diflance which would now he liftened  
to any where, would make a fmall proportion  
of th-narrovveft part of the narrowed feai in  
quvftion.  
  
What arc, in fall, the pr£]Pbg«tivc* claimed  
and rxercifeit by Great Britain over thf^r teas ?  
Ir they werrr r—-ally a pad of her domain, her  
authority -veil&#x27;d h«* the fame there as within her  
otnrr domain. F»»r«igr&gt; viHVls would be ful*­  
fr&gt; jI* the laws and renditions framed for  
them, .n «u:h as it they were within the har­  
bour* or rivers of the country. Nothin); of this  
fort is pretended. Nothing of th*s fort will be  
tolerated. &#x27;I he only indances in which thcle  
feai are didinguifhed from other fra*, or in  
which Great Britain enjoys within them, any  
diflinftion over other nations, arc ftrft, the com­  
pliment paid by other flags to hers. Secondly,  
the extenfion oi her territorial jurifdiltion in  
cerrain cafes to the diflance of four leagues from  
the coalt. The fird is a relic of ancient ufur­  
pation, which has thus long efcaped the cor­  
reflion, which modern and more enlightened  
times have applied to other ufurpations. The  
prerogative has been often conteded, however,  
even at the expenfe of bloody wars, ar\d is dill  
borne with ill will and impatience by her neigh­  
bors. At the lad treaty of peace at Amiens, the  
abolition of it was repeatedly and Itrongly pref­  
fed by I-rance; and it is not improbable, that  
at no remote day it wiil follow the fate of the  
title of “ King of France,” fo long worn bv  
the Bnfifl, monarch*, and at length fo proper­  
ly. facrificed to the leflons ot a magnanimous  
wifdom. As far as this homage to the Britifh  
fl &#x27;g has any foundation at prefent, it reds mere­  
ly on lurg ufage and long acquiefcence, which  
are couflrued, as in a few other cafes of mari­  
time claims, into the effect of a general though  
tacit convention. The fecond indaucc is the  
extenlion of the territorial jurifdiflion to four  
leagues from the (bore. This too, as far as  
the didance may exceed that which is generally  
allowed, reds on a like foundation, flrength­  
cned, perhaps, by the local facility of fmug­  
g&#x27;ing, and the peculiar interell which Great  
Britain has in preventing a pradice a (Tilting fo  
deeply her whole fydem of revenue, commerce,  
and manufalturcs : whild the limitation itlcIf  
to four leagues neceflarily implies that beyond  
that didance no territorial jurifdidion is a (Turn­  
  
eo.  
B-it whatever may be the origin or value of  
thcfe prerogatives over foreign flags in one cafe,  
and w ithin a limited portion of thcfe leas in a­  
nother, it is obvious that neither of them will  
be violated by the exemption of American vef­  
lels from imprefTmciits, which are no wifecon­  
uedted with cither ; haring never been made on  
the pretext either of withholding the wonted  
homage to the Britifh flag, or of fimiegling in  
defiance of Rritidi laws.  
This extenfion of the Britifh law to four  
leagues from the flinre is inferred from an adt  
of parliament pafTtd in the year 1T:jq, (9 O. 2.  
C. 35) the terms of which comprehended all  
veflels, foreign as well as Britifh. It is poflible  
however, that the former arc confli udlivcly ex­  
cepted. Should your inquiries afeertain this  
to be the cafe, you will find yonrfclves on bet­  
terground, than the conccfTion here made.  
With refpcdl to the compliment paid to the  
Britifh flag, it is a!fo poflible that more is here 1  
conceded than you may find to be ntcefT.iry.  
After the peace of 178.% this compliment was  
peremptorily withheld by France, in fpite of  
the remonflrances of Great Britain ; and it re­  
mains for your enquiry, whether it did not con­  
tinue to be rtfufed, not withflanding the failure  
at Amiens to obtain from Great Britain a for­  
mal renunciation of the claim.  
Prom every view of the fubj-dt, it is rcafon­  
able to expert that the exception of the narrow  
leas, from the flipulation againft impreflinents,  
will not be inflexibly maintained. Should it be  
fo, your negociation will be at an end. The J  
truth is, that fo great a proportion of our trade  
diredt and circuitous, pafl&#x27;es through thole  
channels, and fuch is its peculiar expofure in  
them to the wrong praOlifed, that with fuch  
an exception, any remedy would be very par­  
tial. And we can never confem to purchafe  
a partial remedy, hv confirming a general evil,  
&amp; by fubjedting ourfelves to our own reproach­  
es, as well as to thofe of other nations.  
I bird, It appears, as well by a letter from  
Mr. Thornton, in anfwer to one from me, of  
both which copies are er.clofed, as from con­  
versations with Mr. Merry, that the facility  
which would be given, particularly in the Bri­  
tifh channel, by the immunity claimed for A­  
merican veflels, to the cfcnpe of traitors, and  
the defertatiori of others whofe fervices in time  
of wiir may be particularly important to an e­  
nemv, forms one of the pleas for the Britifh  
practice of examining American crews, and will  
be one ofthe objections to a formal relinquiili­  
ment of it.  
This plea, like all others, admits a fidid and  
fatisfadtory reply. In the firfl place, if it could  
prevail at all againfl the neutral claim, it would  
authorise the feizure of the perfons deferibed  
only, and in veflels bound to a hoftile country  
only ; whereas the pradtice of imprefling is ap­  
plied to perfons few, if any of whom, are alledg­  
cd to be of cither defeription, and to vefl&#x27;os  
whitherfoever bound, even to Great Britain  
herfeif. I11 the next place, it is not only a pre­  
ference of a fmallcr objedt on one fide to a great­  
er objedt on the other ; but a facrifice of right  
on one fide, to expediency on the other fide.

Extract of a letter from the Secretary  
of State to James Monroe, Bf.y.  
dated slh January, tBQ4,  
We consider a neutral flag on the  
high sens, as a safeguard to those sail­  
ing under it. Great Britain, on the  
contrary, assert* v right to search tor,  
and seize her own subjects ; and under  
that cover, as cannot oat happen, are  
often seized and taken Off, citizens of  
the United States, and citizens or sub­  
ot other neutral countries, navi­  
gating the high seas, under the   
ftofl of tire flag.  
Were the right of Great Britain, in  
this case, not dented, the abuses Ii1  
from it, would justify the 17. 6. r claim­  
j in}- and expecting a disc&lt;uitii|pance of  
i its exercise. But the right y denied,  
.iiid on the best grounds.  
Although Great Britain has not yet  
adopted, in tiie same latitude with most  
other nations, the immunitiesdl a neu­  
tral Bag, she will not fleoy the general  
freedom of the high seas, and of n&#x27;eul ral  
Is navigating them, with sach ex­  
ceptions only as are annexed to :t by  
I the law of nations. She must produce  
then such an exception in the law ol  
nations, In favor of the right she cow  
tends for. Bat m what written a*ij re­  
ceived authority will she find it t In  
what nsaffej except her own, will it he  
found ? bhe will find in both, that a  
neutral vessel does not protect certain  
object* denominated contraband of war,  
including enemies serving in the war,  
nor articles going into a blockaded port,  
nor as she has maintained, and as%•  
have not contested, enemies property  
of any kind. But no where wiil she  
find an exception to this freedom of the  
seas, and ot neutral Hags, wtr.chjusti  
fies the taking away of any person, not  
sn enemy in military service, found On  
board a neutral Vessel.  
if treaties, British as well as others,  
are to be consulted On this subject, it I  
will (Squally appear, that hb cnunychaate t  
to the practice can be found in them. ,  
Whilst they admit &amp; contraband of war, j  
by ilium rating its articles, and the if- i  
feet of a real blockade*, by doming it, [  
in no instance do tin y affirm or imply a i  
right in any sovereign to iahrce hin j  
cla ins to the allegiance of his su j ■ a,  
,on board neutral vessels on the high i  
,*. as. On the contrary, whenever A  
! beiligeVent claim against persona -&#x27;ii  
b &gt;&#x27;ni a neutfal vessel) ia referred lo in  
treaties en-mics in military set vice  
■alone are excepted from the general  
; Immunity ot persons in lhat situ ition ;  
&#x27; and &#x27;«-~his exception confirms tne imi»U«  
I nity of who are not included in  
it.  
It is not then from the law or the  
ge of nations, nor from the te&gt;  
the treaties, that any sanction can lie  
■ d rive &#x27; i i tii. Pr tctie* in cjti&lt;  
And surely it will not be pretended fiiai !  
the sovereignty of any nation, extends  
in any case whatever, beyond its  
  
dominions, and iis own vessels on the  
high seas, Such a doctrine would  
just alarm to all nations, and mare than  
any thing would countenance the impu­  
i of aspiring to an universal em­  
pire of the s-eas. Jt would be the less  
adftiii \ as it. wool I be applica­  
ble to time&#x27;s of peace&quot;, as. .veil as to  
of .war. and to pimp rty as well as to  
persons. h~ the li* of allegiance,  
which i-&lt; a municipal law, bern turbo at  
all on the high T&#x27;s, on loanl foreign  
vessels, it mu»t be so at all times ilure,  
as it is within Its acknowledged sphere.  
U the reason altej be good in  
tlm■■■ of war, homely, that the sovereign |  
has then a right to ihe serviced! ail e.\s  
&lt; is, it roust be good at all tiroes,  
i because at all times lie hat the same  
1 right to their sen ice. War is not the  
only &lt; ■ ■ i tor which he may want  
their services, nor is external danger i  
the only dangt ■; against which their sor«!  
j vices may be required, for his security.;  
in—if the authority of a municipal  
law can operate on porsoas in foreign  
vessel- ou ihe high seas, because v/itluu  
the dominion ot their sovereign they j  
j would be subject to that l-.w, and are i  
J violating tnat law by being in mat si-  
Ijtuhtion&#x27;, bow reject tiie inference that  
tue authority ot a municipal law may  
• equally bo enforced, on bo&amp;rtl foreign  
j vessels, on the high seas, against artl- J  
; clss of property exported in violation of i  
such a law, ur belonging to the country |  
from which it was exported ? And i  
thus every commercial regulation, in )  
time of peace too, as well as of war,,  
would be made obligatory on foreigners  
and their vessels, not only whilst with- &#x27;  
iv the oemiinon of the sovereign umk.. j  
ing the regulation, but in every 5...., and  
at every distance where an aimed yes- j  
sel might meet with them. Another,  
inference deserves attention, if the ;  
subjects of one sovereign may be Uiaen  
by torce from the vessels oi aimtber, on j  
the high s*ias, the right of taking them  
when tound, implies the right ol search­  
ing tor them&quot;, a yefc&amp;tian ot commerce, ;  
especially in the timeol peaci., which  
lias Hi t yet been attempted, and Which  
tor that as well as oilur reasons, may.  
.&quot;.&#x27; regarded as contradicting the pnnci- J  
from wnich it would Ii *w.  
Taking reason and justice for the  
tests of this praciice, it is peculiarly!  
indefensible ; because it deprives the \
dearest rights or a regular trial, to  
winch the most inconsiderable aiueie  
of property captured ou Hie nigh seas,  
is entitled ; ana leaves their destiny to,  
th&lt;£ will of an officer, sometimes cruel,  
i ignorant, and generally interest­  
ed oy his want of manners, in his own  
decisions. Whenever property found  
in it neutral vessel, is supposed to be  
liable, on any grounds to capture and  
condemnation, the rule in ail cases is  
that th* question shall not be decided  
by me emptor, but be carried before v  
legrl irinuual, where a regular trial  
may be had, and where tue c.tpioi  
himself is liatjle to damages, tor an  
abuse of his power. Can it ue reason*  
able tnen, or just, that a belligerent  
commander, who is thus restricted, and  
tliuo rusponstble in a case of inert pro­  
perty of trivial amount, should be per­  
muted, wunout recurring to any tnoa­  
nal wiiuttver, to examine ttit crew oi  
a neutral vessel, to decide tiie impor­  
tant question of their respective alle­  
giances, and to Carry that decision line  
instant execution, by turcmg every ia  
dividual he may chuse, into a service  
abhorrent to Ins feelings, cutting him  
otl train his most tender connexions,  
exposing his mind and his person to the  
most humiliating discipline, and his lilt  
Itself to the greatest dangers .&#x27; Reason,  
justice and humanity unite in protesting  
against so extravagant a&#x27;proceeding.  
And what is tne pretext for it i It is  
that the similarity of language and of  
features between American citizens and  
iiritish subjects, are such as not easily  
to be distinguished; and that without  
this arbitrary and summary authority  
to make the distinction, British subjects  
would escape, under the name of Ame­  
rican citizens, from the outy winch j  
tl»ey owe to their sovereign. Is then j  
the dilticulty ot distinguishing a man-j  
tier of one country from tiie mariner of \
the other, and the importance of his j  
services, a good plea tor referring the  
question whether lie belongs to tne one j  
or to the other, to an arbitrary decision &#x27;

be affirmed that this is an outran sr &#x27;.  
an indignity which has no precedent-, Be  
which (J. Baitain would be among  
last nations in the world tosu**er, if of*,

Nor la it always against the right  
presumption alonej which is in favor of  
rfc citizenship corresponding with the  
flag1} that the violence is committed.--.  
Not unfreejuently it tbkes place in de­  
fiance oi the most positive proof, eertin­  
ed in due form by an American ofiuttr.  
Let it not be said, that hi granting to  
I American seamen this protection Joe  
their rights as such, the point 1* yielded  
that the prior He* m the American  
side, and that the want of it in the pre.  
scribed form justifies the Inference  
the seamen is not of American all  
■ ance, it Is distinctly th be understood,  
&#x27; that the certificate usually called a pro­  
&#x27; tection to American seamen, is not  
; meant to protect them under their oivn,  
or even any other neiitral Jiag on the  
high seas. VVe can never admit, that  
iin such am .nation, any other protecion i.3  
required for them, than the neutraljtag  
itself on the nigh seas, &#x27;i to document  
is given to prove their real character,  
ih situ&#x27; ti&#x27;T.&#x27;. to which neither the law of  
nations nor the law of then own country  
are applicable ; in other words, to pro­  
; tect them within the jurisdiction ot the  
i British law-;, and to secure to t1  
i within every other jurisdiction, the  
\ rights and immunities due to them, if;  
, in the course of their navigation evert  
on the high seas, the document should  
have the effect of repelling wrongs of  
! any sort, it is an incidental advantage  
only, of which they avail themselves,  
j and is by no meads to be misoonsti  
| into a right to exact such a proof, or to  
! make any disadvantageous inference  
from the want ot it.  
! Were it even admitted, that certificate j  
for protection might be jullly requir­  
ed in time of war, from American iea­  
\ men, they cObid only be required in  
cafes where the lapfe of time norn its  
j commencement, hnil given an oppor­  
-1 trinity for the American few men, to  
J provide theraVeivet With fuch a docu-  
I merit. Yet it is certain, that in a va­  
j riety of inlhuice?, feamen have been im­  
-1 prelTed from American vefl&#x27;ets, on the  
plea that they had not this proof of  
1 citizen(hip when the dates and place&#x27;s of  
i the inrpreilment* demonitrated the im­  
! pollibility oi thtii knowing; in time to  
provide tht proof, that a itate of war had

law ot nations, the tenor of treaties, or  
the dictates of realotl and pjltice, no luir­  
runt no pretext can be Jo and Jor the  
British practice oj ma/&lt;t&gt;ig impress*

tireat Britain has the less to say in  
excuse for this practice, as it is in tti­  
rect contradiction to the principles, on  
which she proceeds in other cases   
Wiuist she claims and seizes on Iho  
high seas her own subjects&#x27;, voluntarily  
serving in American vessels&#x27;, sue  
constantly given, when she Couid give,  
S3 reason for not discharging from :.ti  
service American Citiaens, that they  
had Voluntarily engaged m it. Nay more,  
whilst she impresses her own subjects  
from the American service, altho&#x27; they  
may havebeeiisettled. it«i married, and  
even naturalized in thy J. States, stie  
constantly reiu»es to release Iroin hers,  
American citizens impressed into it,  
whenever she can give for reason, that  
they were either settled or married  
within her dominions. Thus, when tue  
voluntary consent of ihe individual ta­  
vors ncr pretensions, she pleads tue va­  
lidity of that consent. When the vo­  
luntary consent of the individuals,  
stands in the way of her pretensions}  
it goes for tiothmg ! When marriago  
or residence can be pleaded in her fa­  
vor, &#x27;she avails herself of the plea.-—  
| When marriage and residence and even  
! naturalization art against her, fto re­

karpsby inrce American citizens invo­  
luVitarily serving in hers. More ila­

the whole number,leaving 805 for fur­

le, were AmericaI*!* or aliens  
■w&#x27;.ofe proof of had been loft  
or deirroyed, Or whofe fituation Would  
, account for the difficulties and dtlav*  
in producing it. So that it ii certain,  
that for all the Britilh feamen gained  
by this viol.-]!? proceeding, more than  
an equal numbrr, who we c not fo,  
•were the vi&amp;ims ; it is highly &quot;probable  
that for every Britifh feam-n fo gained,  
a number of others, JeTs than 10 for one,  
rnuft have been the vicYims and it  
is even pofoble that this number may  
have exceeded the proportion of twenty  
to one.  
It c mot therefore be doubted, that  
the acquisition of British seamen, by  
these impressments, Whatever may be  
its advantage, is lost la the wrong done  
to Americas Igrtorantly or willfully rnis­  
for British subjects, in tUe jea­  
lousy and ill-will excited among all ma­  
ririm&#x27;j nitons by an adherence to such  
n practice, and in the particular provo­  
cation to measures of redress oh the  
part of the U. S. not le*s disagreeable  
to them, than embarrassing to Great  
Britain, and which may threaten the  
-•:diog which ought to be  
faithfully cultivated by both. The co­  
py of a bill brougTu into Congress under  
the influence of violations committed on  
our fl it:, gives force to this latter con­  
•tderati ;n. Whether it will pas* into  
;i law, and at the present scsi-ion, is  
more than can yet be said. As tin re is  
every reason to b&#x27;eli&#x27;:ve that it has been  
proposed with reluctance, it will pro­  
jiial ly not b ; pursued into effect, if any  
hepe can be supported of a remedy, by  
an amicable arrangement between the  
two n. i to  
There Mh a further consideration  
which ought to have weight in this .  
tion. Although the British seiui&quot;ti J  
I ryed In carrying on American com­  
■ , be In • ■ r-?»pects lost to their  
own nationj ytt such is the intimate be  
extensive connection, of this commerce,  
direct and circuitous, with the c*m­  
merce, the m the rev  
r.nd the general resource* of the British  
nation; that in other respcest Its mari­  
ner*,&lt;,n board American vessels, may  
truly be said to be rendering it the  
iriovt valuable services. It would not  
be extravagant to make it a question,  
Whether G, Britain would not sulF. r  
by withdrawing her seamen from  
the merchant vessels ofthe U. S. thin  
h?r enemies would suffer from the ad­  
dition ot thorn to the crews cf her  
i;»s ot vv a r antlcmi se r s.  
Should any difficulty be started con­  
cernirrg seamen born within the British  
dominions, and naturalized oy the U.  
S. since the treaty of 1783, you may re­  
move it by observing : First, that very  
few,if ahy,such natur lizations can take  
place, the law here requiring a prepa­  
ratory residence of rive years, with no­  
tice of the intention to become a citizen  
entered of record two years before the !  
last necessary formality, besides a re- !  
gnUr proof of good and moral charac- I  
lev, &lt; ondiUons little likely to be com* [  
j hsd with oy ordinary seafaring per- !  
Secondly, that a discontinuance  
dpressments on the high seas will  
■ ide an actual collision between the  
ipterf«tring claims. Within th* juris­  
ttttrtidn of each nation, and in their  
respective vessels on the high seas,  
each will enforce the allegiance wbi;h  
{r. claims. In other situations the iridi­  
vidual* doubly claimed, willbe within a  
jurisdiction independent of both n.t­  
---• tion*. &#x27;  
Secondly. The British pretensions to  
domain ov-r tiie narrow seas ai&quot; I  
e,and soindefehsibio, that they nc  
vonld h*rve occirred.as a probable  
cion in this case, if they had not  
actually frustrated.an arrangement sot­  
- y My. Kuo£ with tii« British mi­  
-Oistry ou the BuhjeCt of in.pres,meats  
Amwri&#x27;.:aii wsseli on tue high  
4  
  
1 seat. At the moment wfcenthcnW-i  
cles were expected to Designed, an ex­  
ception ofthe &quot;narrow seas&quot; was urg­  
ed and insisted on by lord St. Vincent;  
and b-jing utterly inadmissible on our  
put, the negOClAtiou was abandoned.  
The objection la itself has certainly  
not the slightest foundation. The tune  
ha 3 been indeed when England not only  
claimed, but excrcineai pretensions  
scarcely inferior to full sovereignty over  
the seas surrounding the British isles,  
and even as far as cipe Finistere to the  
south, and Van Staten, in Norway, to  
the north. Jt was a time, however,  
when reason had, little share in deter­  
mining the law, and the intercourse of  
nations, when power alone decided  
l qui-St ions of right, and when the igno-  
I ranee and want of concert among other  
maritime countries facilitated such an  
usurpation. Th&lt;r progress of civiliza­  
tion and information has produced a  
i change in all those respects, and no  
principlefn tile code of public law, is  
iat present better established, than the  
common freedom of the seas beyood a  
&#x27; very limited distance from territories  
washed I y them. This distance is not  
indeed fixed with absolute precision. It  
i-, vanrd in a small degree by wiitten  
1 authorities, &amp; perhaps It may be reason- j  
ably varied in some degree by local pc- j  
: culiar&#x27;uies, But the greatest distance  
Which would now be listened to any  
| where, would make a sm ill proportion  
jof th narrowest part of the narrowest  
j seas in question,  
{ What are, in fact, the prerogatives  
claimed and exercised by G. Britain  
j over the*.&#x27; as ? If thay were really a  
j part of her domain, her authority would  
be the same there as within her other  
domain* Foreign vessels would be sub­  
i ject to all the laws and regulations  
framed for them&#x27;, as much as if they  
wert) within the harbors or rivers ofthe:  
country. Nothing of this s&lt; rt is pre­  
tended. Nothing of this sort will be to­  
lerated. The only instances in which  
these seas are distinguished from other  
seas, or in which G. Britain enjoys [  
within them, any distinction over other  
nations, are first, the compliment paid  
by other flags to her-. Secondly, the  
exten ion of h rterritori ljunsdictionin  
certain to the distance of four  
I* agues from the coast. The first is a  
relic of ancient usurpation, which has  
thus long escaped the correction, which j  
modern »nd more enlightened times  
have applied to other usurpations. The  
prerogative has been often contested,  
howeveT,even at the expense of bloody  
wars, and is still borne with ill will and  
impatience by her neighbors. At the  
last treaty of peace at Amiens, the a­  
bolitionof ifwaa repeatedly and strong­  
ly pressed by France ; and it is not im­  
probable, that at no remote day it will  
follow the fate of the title of &quot; King of  
France,&quot; so long worn by t!v British  
monarchs, and at length so properly Ba­  
crihcetl to the lessons of a magnanimous  
wisdom. As fur as this homage to the  
British flag has any foundation at pre­  
sent, it rests merely on long usage and  
long acquiescence, which are construed,  
as in a few other cases of maritime  
claims, into the eifect of a general tho&#x27;  
tacit convention. The second instance  
is the extension of the territorial juris­  
diction to four leagues from the shore.  
This too, as far as the distance may  
exceed that which is generally allowed,  
rests on a like fouodation, strengthened,  
perhaps, by the local facility of smug­  
gling, and the peculiar interest which  
Great Britain has in preventing a prac­  
tice affecting so deeply her whole sys­  
tem &gt;f revenue, commerce and manu­  
factures t whilst the limitation itselt  
to four leagues necessarily implies that  
beymd that d&#x27;stance no territorial ju­  
risdiction is assumed.  
But whatever may he the origin or  
value of these prerogatives over foreign  
j flags in our case, and within a limited  
! portion of these seas in another, it is  
obvious that neither of them will be  
violated by the exemption of American  
vessels from impressments, which are  
no wibe connected with either ; having  
n.;vcr been marie the pretext either  
ot withholding the wonted homage to  
the British fl g, or ot smuggling in de­  
li .nee of British laws.  
Ihe extension of the British law to  
four leagues from the shore is inferred  
from an act of parliament passed in the  
year 1736, (9 G 2. C. 35; the terms of  
which comprehended all vessels, fo­  
reign as well as British. It is possible,  
however, that the former are construc­  
tively excepted.—Should your inquiries  
ascertain this to be the case, you will  
find yourself on better ground, that the  
concession here made.  
With respect to the compliment paid  
to the British flag, it is also possible thai  
more is heft conceded than you may  
find to be necessary. After the peace  
of 1783, this compliment was peremp^  
torily withheld by France, in spue of  
the remonstrances of Great Britain ;  
and it remains for your inquiry, whe­  
i ther it did not continue to be refused,  
! notwithstanding the failure at Amiens,  
:to obtain from Great Britain a formal  
j renunciation of the claim.  
From every view of the subject, it is  
reasonable to expect that the exception  
of the narrow seas, from the stipulation  
against impressments, will not be in­  
flexibly maintained. Should it be so, I  
your ne.gociation will be at an end. The |  
truth is, that so great a proportion of j  
our tra&#x27;ie direct and circuitous, passes  
through those channels, and su;!i is its  
peculiar exposure In them,to the wrong  
practised, that with stiCh an exception,  
any remedy would be very partial.—  
And we can never consent to purchase  
a partial remedy, by confirming a ge­  
neral *&#x27;vil, and by subjecting ourselves  
to our own reproaches, as well as to  
those of Other nations.  
Third,, It appears, as ••veil by a letter  
from Mr. &#x27;1 horn ton, in answer to one  
from me, of both which copies arc in- ,­  
closed, a* trow conversations with Air.  
  
IMi i*ry, that the facility which would be ,  
given, particularly in the British chan­  
nel, by the immunity claimed for Ame­  
rican vessels, to the. escape of traitors,  
and the desertion.&#x27; of others whose  
services in time oi war may !»e parti*  
cularly important to an onemy, forms  
one of the pleas for the British practice j  
of examining American crews, anc* will j  
be one of the objection* to a formal re-1  
lincpjfshmept of it.  
This plea, like all. the. others, admit*  
a solid and satisfactory reply. In the  
firs* place, if it could prevail at all a­  
frauist the neutral claim, it would uti­  
thorjze the of the persons de­  
scribed only, and in vessels bound to a  
hostile country only; whereas tne prac­  
tise of Impressing is applied to person*  
few, If any of whom are. alleged to be ot  
either description, and to vess* b; whi­  
thersoever bound&#x27;, even to Great Bri­  
tain herseH. In the next place, it is  
not only a pref. rcice of a smaller ob«  
ject on one Bid* to a greater object on  
the other ; but a pacrin.ee of right on  
one ;.uie, to expediency on the other  
side.

Extract of a letter from the Secretary of  
State to James Monroe, Estj. dated 5th  
Jc h uaiy. 1804.  
\YE consider a neutral flag, on the high  
seas, as a Safeguard to those sailing under i  
it. Grcat-liritain on the contrary, asserts I  
a right to search for and seize her own sub- j  
jects ; and under that cover, us cannot but !  
  
nappcn, arc often seized and taken off, ci­  
tizens oi the United .States, and citizens or  
subjects ot other neutral countries, naviga­  
ting the high seas, under the protecton of  
tile American flag.  
Were the right of Oreat-Britain, in this  
case, not denied, the abuses flowing from it,  
would justify the United States in claiming  
anti expecting a discontiuance of its exer­  
the right is denied, and on the  
best grounds.  
Although Oreat-Britain lias not yet a­  
dopted, in the same latitude with most o­  
ther nations, the immunities of a neutral  
flag, she will not deny the general freedom  
oi the high seas, and of neutral vessels na­  
vigating them, with such exceptions only  
as are annexed to it by the law of nations,  
themustpio uce lien each an &lt; xception in  
the law of nations in lav* r of the r.glit  
she contends for. But in what written  
and received author ty will she find it  
In what usage except her own, will it be  
found ? She w 11 find in both, that a neu­  
tral vessel does not protect certain on­  
Ci.ts deuotnini.icd contraband of w .r, m­  
clu.iing enemies serving in the war, nor  
articles going into a blockaded port, nor as  
she has maintained, and as we have not  
contested, enemies pmpetty of any k nd.  
lUr. rr» where will she find an exception to  
tins freedom of the seas, and of neutral  
fla^s, wmc I justifies tile taking away ninny  
person, not un enemy in milituiy service,  
found on board a neutral vessel.  
if treaties, Bik.su as Well as others, are  
to b&lt;. cornu ted on this subject, it wil,  
quaily appear, that no countenance to the  
practice can be- found in them. Whilst  
they admit a contraband of war, by enu­  
merating its articles, and the* effect of a  
real blockade by defining it, in no instance  
£&lt;&gt; they affirm or imply a right in antj so­  
vereign to uiforce hit, claims to the allegi­  
ance oj hit subjects, on b mi d nc utrul ves­  
sels on the high seas. On the contrary,  
whenever a belligerent claim against per­  
sons on hoard a neutnl vesse , is relerred  
. to in treaties, enemies in military service  
alone&#x27; are excepted from the general im­  
munity of persons in that situation ; and  
this exception confirms die immunity of  
those who are not included in it.  
It is not then from the law or the usage  
of nations, nor from the tenor of treaties,  
that any sanction can be derived for the  
practice in question. And surely it will  
not be pretended that tue sovereignty of  
any nation, extends in any case whatever,  
benona its own dominions, and its own ves­  
sels on the high sens. Such a doctrine  
  
wmu give just alarm to all nations, and |  
more than any thing would countenance the |  
Imputation of,, aspiring to an nnrvcrsal eni- ;  
pire of the- seas. It would be the less ad­  
m ssible too, as it would be applicable to  
times of peace, an well as to times of war, :  
and to property as well as to persons, if  
the law of allegiance, which is a muni ci- j  
Pal law, be in force at all on the high sens,  
•n board foreign vessels, it must be so at I  
all times there, as it is within its acknow­  
ledged sphere. If the reason altedg d for  
it be good in time of war, namely, that the  
sovereign has then a riglrt to the si rvlceof  
all his subjects, it must be good at all  
times, bi came at all times he has the same  
right to their service. War is not the only  
occasion for which he may want their ser­  
vices, nor is external dangerthe only dan­  
ger againt which their services may i»e re­  
quired, for his security. Again if the  
authority of a municipal law can operate  
on j.t rsons :n foreign vessels on the high  
sea*, be. ause w ithin the dominion of their  
sovereign they would be subject to that  
law, and are violating that l.»w by being  
in that situation, how reject the inference  
that the authority of a municipal law may  
♦tonally be enforced, on boa id foreign vis­  
Mbs, on the high seas, against articles of  
property exported in violation of snch a  
law, or belonging to the country from which  
it v as exp »i led . And thus every comiuer- *  
cial regulation, in time of peace Px,, as well i  
as ot war, would be made obligatory on fo- |  
rng’ trs and their vessels, not only whilst i  
. v ;lhin the dominion of the sovereign niak- j  
l ig the regulation, but in every sea, and at ■  
evrty distance where an armed vessel i  
might meet with them. Another mferehce l  
deserves attention. If the subjects of one i  
sovereign may he taken by force from the i  
vessels of another, on the high seas, the i  
right of (nMng them whcii founds i&#x27;^plirn i  
the right of -eart hing lor them, a Vexation  
of commerce, especially in tho time of i 1  
prair-, which has not yet been attempted,  
i nil which for that as well as other rea­  
soos, hi . v be regarded as contradicting the  
diinciple, from which it would flow,  
  
Taking reason tnd justice fc.f llic tests*  
»f this practice, it is peculiarly irtdefensi­  
ve ; because it deprives the dearest rights  
&gt;t a regular trial, to which the must incon­  
i&#x27;derable articles of prnjierty captured on  
he higtiVeasp is entitled ; and leaves their  
u stiny to the will of an officer, sometimes  
:niel, often ignorVuit, and generally inter­  
•sted by his want of mariners, in iiis own  
lecisions. Whenever property found in a  
teutral vessel, is supposed to be liable, on  
my grounds to capture and condemnation,  
•he rule in all cases is that the question  
&#x27;hall not lie decided by the captor, but be  
:arried before a legal tribuna&#x27;, where a  
regular trial may he had, and where the  
raptor himself is liable to damages, for an  
l&#x27;msc of his power. Can it be reasonable  
:!vcn, tSr just that a belligerent commah­  
ler, who is tlius restricted, aid thus re­  
sponsible m a case of mere property of tri­  
vial amount, should lie permitted, without  
recurring to any tribunal whatever, toex­  
tmine tlie crew of a neutral vessel, to de­  
:ide the important quest on of their re­  
spective allegiances and to carry that deci­  
sion into instant execution, by forcing every  
individu al he may choose, into a service ab­  
horrent to his feelings, cuttinghim off from  
Iiis most lender connections, exposing his  
mind and his person t«i the most humiliating  
discipline, and his ife itself to the great­  
est dangers? Reason, justice and humani- ]  
ty unite in protesting against so extrava*  
gant a proceeding. And what is the pre­  
text for it ? It is that the similarity of lan­  
guage and of features between American  
citizens and llritish subjects, are such as  
not easily to be distingu.shed ; and that  
without tins arbitrary and summary au­  
  
vn.iriiv in m ikc me distinction, tsrmsn  
subjects would escape, under the name ot  
American citizens, from the duly which  
they owe to their sovereign. Is then the dif­  
ficulty ot distinguishing a mariner of one  
country from the mariner of the other, Utlie  
importance ot his services, a good plea for  
rcteringthe cpicstion whether he belongs to  
the one or to the other, to an arbitrary de­  
cision on the spot, by an interested and un­  
responsible officer ? In all other cases, the  
difficulty and the importance of questions  
are considered as reasons for requiring  
greater care and formality in investigating  
them, ?.nd greater security for a right de­  
cision on them. To say that precautions  
ot this sort are incompatible with the ob­  
ject is to admit the object is unjustifiable ;  
since the only means by which it can be  
pursued are such as cannot be just. tied.  
I&#x27;hc evil takes a deeper die, when view­  
ed n its practice as wel as its principles.  
\\ ere it allowed that British subjects  
should be taken out of American ves­  
sels on he high seas, it might at least be  
required that the proof of their allegiance  
should he on the British side. This obvi­  
ous and just rule is, however, revencri ;  
and • very seaman on hoard though goii g  
from an American port, ai d sailing under  
the Ainer&gt;can Hag, and aonietiines even  
speaking an idiom proving him not to be a  
British subject, is presumed to be sticb,  
mi ess shewn to be an American c tizen.  
It may saiely be affirmed that this is an  
outrage and an indignity which has no pre­  
cedent, ami which Oreat-Britain wouid be  
among the last nations in the world to suffer,  
if offered to her own subjects, and her own  
Hag. &gt;ior is it always against the right  
presumption alone, which is in favor of the  
citizenship correspoding w ith the flag, that  
the violence is committed Not imfre­  
quently it takes place in defiance of the  
most positive proof, certified in due form  
by an American officer. Lot it not be  
said, that in granting to American sea­  
men this prelection for their rights as  
such, the point is yielded, that the proof  
lies on the American side, and that  
the want of it in the prescribed form  
justifies the inference that the seamen is  
not of Am rican allegiance. It is distinct­  
ly to he understood, that the certificate u­  
sually called a protection to American  
seamen, is not meant to protect them un­  
der their own, or even unxj other neutral  
flag on the high seas. We can never ad­  
mit, that in such a situation, any other  
protection is required for them than the  
neutral Jlag itself on the high seas. The  
document is given to prove their realrha  
raeter, in situations to which neither the  
law of nations, nor the law of their own  
country, arc applicable; in other words,  
to protect them within the jurisdiction of  
  
in* JMivmn i.iwa, aim iu secure 10 them,  
within every other jurisdiction, the rights  
and immunities due to them. If, i„ the &#x27;  
course of their navigation even on the &#x27;  
li gh st as, the document should have the  
i-flect of repelling wrongs of any sort, it is  
in incidental advantage only,of which they  
avail themselves, and is by&#x27;no means to be  
misconstrued into a right to exact such a  
proof, or to make any disadvantageous in­  
ference from the want of it.  
Were it even admitted, that certificates  
&lt;&gt;r protection might lie justly required in  
mie of war, from American seamen, they  
:ould only be required in cases where the  
apse of t me from its commencement, had  
;iven an opportunity for the Arnericansea­  
nen to provide themselves w&lt;tli such a d&lt;~­  
ument. Yet it iscerta n, that in a variety  
if instances, seamen have been impiessed  
from American vessels, on Die plea that  
hey had not this proof of citizenship, when  
lie dates and places of the impressments  
lcmnnstiatt-d the impossibility of their  
tnowing in time to provide the proof, that  
i state of war had rendered it necessary.  
Whether, therefore, we consult the law  
&gt;f nations, the tenor of treaties, or Dedic­  
ates of reason mid justice, no warranty no I  
irrtr.i t can hr /ouml for the Jintish firuc­  
ice of making im/nc)s*inentn from jimeri- \
at) vemrla on the high kcuh.  
Great Britain has the less to say in ex*  
;use for this practice, ash is in direct con­  
radiction to the principles, on which she j  
iroceeds in other cases Whilst she claims !  
ind seizes on the high sear,* her own sub- I  
ects, voluntarily serving in American ves­  
►els, she has constantly given, when she !

hey had voluntarily engaged in it. Nay, |  
norc, whilst she impresses her own sub*

hey may have been settled and married,  
»nu even naturalised in the United States,  
the constantly refuses to release from hers,  
American citizens impressed into it, &#x27;&#x27;hen- !

against her, no respect whatever is paal to

(Concluded.)  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives,!  
tvliich ought tc be I&#x27;elt by the British govern- j  
ment to relinquish a practice which expo- j  
ses it to so many reproaches, it is foreseen,  
that objections of different sorts will be &#x27;  
pressed on you. You will be told first, of  
t.ie great number of British seamen in the j  
American trade, and of the necessity for I  
their services in time of war and danger.1  
Secondly, of the right and the prejudice of  
tlie British nation with respect to what arc  
called the British or narrow seas, where  
its domain would be abandoned by the ge­  
neral stipulation required. Thirdly, of the  
use which would be made ot such a sanc­  
tuary as that of American vessels, for de­  
sertions, and traitorous communications to  
her enemies, especially across the channel  
to France.  
1st. Witn respect to the British seamen  
serving in cur trade, it may he remarked,  
first,, that the number, th -ugh consi lera­  
ble, is probably less than mav be supposed  
Secondly, that what it. wrong in itself can­  
not be made right by considerations of ex­  
pediency or advantage. Thirdly, that it  
is proved by the fact that the number of  
veal British subjects gained by the practice  
in question, is of considerable importance  
even in the scale of advantage. The an­  
nexed report to congress on the subject of  
impressments, with the addition of such ca­  
ses as may be in the hands ofMr. Ewing,  
then our consul in I.ondon, will verify the  
remark in its application to the present  
war. flie statement made by l\is prede­  
cessor daring the last war, anti which is  
a.so annexed, is in the same view still  
more conclusive. The statement compre­  
  
.*v ..-rv viiij ci«. iiiv uiatiC uy  
!u:n in tue first instance, for the liberation  
o! impressed seamen, between the month  
ot June, 1797, and Sept. lS(jl, but many also  
which had been made previous to this a­  
gency, by Mr. Pinckney and Mr. King, and  
which it was necessary for him to renew  
These applications therefore may fairly be  
considered as embracing the greater part  
ot the period of the war ; and as applica­  
tions are known to be pretty indiscrimi­  
nately made, they mav further he consi­  
dered as embracing if hot the whole, the  
far greater part of the impressments, those  
of British subjects as well as others.  
Yet the result exhibits 2,059 cases onlr, and  
of this number 102 seamen only, detained  
as being British subjects, which is less than 1  
2 1-9 of the number impressed, and 1,142  
discharged or ordered to he so, as not being  
British subjects, which is more than half  
of the whole number, leaving fi©5 for fur­  
ther proof, with the strongest presumpti­  
on, that the greater part, if not the whole,  
were Americans or other aliens, whose  
proof ot citizenship had been lost or des­  
troyed, or whose situation would account  
for the difficulties and delays, In producing  
it. So that it is certain, that for all the  
British seamen gained by tiiis violent pro­  
ceeding, more than an equal number, who  
were not so, were the victims; it is high­  
ly probable that for every British seamen  
so gamed, a number of others, less than 10  
for one, must have been the victims, and  
it is even possible that this number may  
have exceeded the proportion of twenty to  
one.  
It cannot therefore be doubted, that the  
requisition of British seamen; by these im­  
pressments, whatever may be its advan­  
tage, is lost in the wrong done to Ameri­  
cans ignorantly or wilfuily mistaken for  
British subjects, h the jealousy and ill-will  
  
excucu among an maritime nations by an  
adherence to such a practice, and in the  
particular provocation to mertsures of re­  
dress on the part of the United States, not  
less disagreeable to them, than emlmrrns­  
singto Great Britain, k which may threa­  
ten the good understanding which ought  
to be faithfully cultivated by both. The  
copy of a bill brought into congress under  
the influence of violations committed on our  
f.^g gives force to this latter cons:deration.  
Whether it will pass into a law, and at the  
present session, is moi e than can yet be  
jsaid. As there is every reason to btdicte  
i that it ha* been proposed with reluctance,  
jit will probably not be pursued Into effect,  
if any hope can be supported of a remedy,  
j by an amicable arrangement between the  
| two nations.  
There is a further consideration which  
ought to have weight in this question. Al­  
»hough the British seamen employed in car­  
rying on American commerce, be in some  
respects lost to their own nation, yet such  
is the intimate and extensive connection of  
this commerce, direct and circuitous, wiih  
the commerce, the manufactures, the reve­  
nue and the general resource* of the Bri*  
tisli nation, that in other respect*it* mari­  
ners, on board American vcssls, may truly  
he snid to be rendering it the most valua­  
ble services. It would not be extravagant  
to make it a question, whether Great Bri­  
tain would not suffer more- by withdrawing  
her seamen from the merchant vessels of  
I the United States, than her enemies would  
suffer from the addition of them to the  
crews of her ships of war and cruisers.  
Should any difficulty he started concern­  
ing seamen born within the British domini­  
ons, and naturalized by the l/nited States  
since the treaty of 17X3, you may remove  
it by observing ; First, that very few, if a­  
ity, stmh naturalizations can take place, the  
flaw here requiring a preparatory residence  
  
of five years, with notice of the intention j  
to become a citizen entered of record two j  
years before the last necessary formality,  
besides a regular proof of good and moral |  
character, conditions little likely to be com­  
plied with by ordinary seafaring persons.  
Secondly, that a discontinuance of impress­  
ments on the high scus will preclude an  
actual collision between the interfering  
claims. YY ithin the jurisdiction «f each  
nati,on, and in their respective vessels on  
the high seas, each will enforce the allegi­  
ance .which it claims. In other situations  
the individuals doubly claimed, will be  
within a jurisdiction independent of both  
nations.  
Secondly. The British pretensions to do- i  
main over the narrow seas are so obsolete, j  
and so indefensible, that thev never would  
have occurred as a probable objection in |  
this case, if they bad not nctua’ly frustra­  
ted an arrangement settled bv Mr. King  
with the Brstish ministry on the subject of  
impressments from American vessels on  
the high seas. At the moment when the  
articles w ere expected to be sivn- d, an &lt; x  
ception of the &quot; narrow seas” was urged  
and insisted on by lord St. Vincent.; and  
being utterly inalmissiblc on our part, the !  
negociation was abandoned.  
The objection in itself lias certainly net \
the slightest foundation. .The time hasbeen  
indeed when England not only claimed, but  
exercised pretensions scarcely inferior to  
foil sovereignty over the seas surrounding  
the British isles, and even as far as cape  
Finistere to the south,-and Y&#x27;an Staten, in  
Norway, to the north. It wasa time,howe­  
ver, when reason had little share in deter­  
mining the law, and the intercourse of na­  
tions, when power alone decided questions  
of right, and when the ignorance anti want  
of concert among other maritime countries  
faciHated such an usurpation. The pro­  
gress of civilization and information lias  
produced a change in all these respects,  
and no principle in the code of public law,  
  
K&#x27;VOV.II uvuv.1 LblUUUMirU, lilciD liic  
common freedom of the seas beyond a very  
limited distanQe from territories washed by  
them. This d&#x27;stftnce is not indeed fixed  
absolute with percision. It is varied in a  
small degree by written authorities. £&lt;. per­  
haps it may he reasonably varied in some  
degree by local peculiarities. But the grea­  
test distance which would now lie listened  
to any where, would make a small propor­  
tion of the narrowest part of the narrowest  
seas in question.  
What are, in fact, the prerogatives claim­  
ed and exercised by Great Britain over  
these seas? If they were r&lt; ally a part of  
her domain! her authority w.*u d |&gt;c the  
«ame there as within her other domain.  
Foreign ves»cl* would he subject to all the  
laws and regulations framed for them, as  
much as if they were within the harbours  
nr rivers of the country. Nothing of  
this sort is pretended. Nothing of this  
sort will be tolerated. The only in­  
stances in which these seas are distinguish­  
ed ironi nthr r seas, nr in which Great Bri­  
tain enjoys within them, any distinction o­  
ver other nations, are first, the compliment  
paid by other fiags to hors. Secondly, the  
extension of her territorial jurisdiction in  
certain cases to the distance of four leagues  
from the coast. The first is a relic of°an­  
cient usurpation, which lias thus long es­  
caped the correction, which modern and  
more er.lighter.d timss have applied to  
other usurpations. The prerogative has  
been often contested*, however, even at the  
expense of bloody wars, and is still borne  
with iil will and impatience by her neigh­  
bors. At the last treaty of pe*ice at Amiens,  
the abortion of it was repeatedly and  
strongly pressed by France ; and it&#x27;is not  
improbable, that at no remote day it will  
follow the fate of the title of“ king of  
France,” so long worn by the British mo­  
narchs, and at length so properly sacrifi­  
! cctl tothe lessons of a magnanimous wisdom.  
As far ns this homage to the British flag has  
any foundation at present, it vests merely  
on long usage and long acquiescence, which  
are construed, as in a few other cases of  
maritime cla ms, into the effect of a gcr.et al  
though tacit convention. The second in­  
stance Is the. extension of the territorial ju­  
risdiction to four leagues from the shore.  
rI his too, as far a$ the distance may exceed  
that which is generally allowed, rests op a  
like foundation, strengthened, perhaps, by  
| the local facility of smuggling, and the pc­  
  
-- lltllll (lit?) Ill  
preventing a practice affecting so deeply  
her whole system cf revenue, commerce,  
and manufactures t whilst the limitation  
itself to four leagues necessarily implies  
that bcyornl that distance no territorial ju­  
risdiction is assumed.  
i But whatever maybe the origin or valtie  
of these prerogatives over foreign flags in  
one case, and within a limited portion of  
these seas in another, It is obvh&#x27;us that nel­  
I thor of them will be violated by the ex­  
emption of American vessels from impress­  
ments, which arc no wise connected with  
either ; having never been made on the  
pretext cither of withholding the wonted  
hoinape to the British flag, or of smuggling  
In defiance of British laws.  
This extension cf the British law to four  
leagues from the shore is inferred from an  
act of parliament passed in the year 173G,  
(‘J O. 2. C. 35) the terms of which compi e-*  
headed all vessels, foreign as well as Bri*  
tish. It is possible however, that the for­  
mer are constructively excepted.—Should  
lyour Inquiries ascertain this to he the case,  
lyoti will find yourself on better ground,  
titan the concession here made.  
With respect to the compliment paid to  
the British flag, it is a’.-&gt;opossible that rtu&gt;rc  
is here conceded than you may find to he  
n««*»»aiy, Aitor the peace of this  
  
compliment was peremptorily withheld by  
France, m spite of the remonstrance# of G,  
Britain ; and it remains for your enquiry,  
whether it did not continue to be refused,  
notwithstanding the faiiuvc at Amiens to  
obtain from Great Britain a formal renun­  
ciation of the claim.  
Front every view of the subject, it i? rea­  
sonable to expect that the exception of the  
narrow seas, from the stipulation against  
impressments, will not he inflexibly main­  
tained. Should it be so, your negneiation will  
be at an end. The truth is, that so great a  
proportion of our trade direct and circuit­  
ous, passes thro’ those channels, ami such  
is its peculiar exposure in them to the wrong  
practised, that with such un exception, any  
remedy would be very partial. And we  
can never consent to purchase n partial re­  
medy, by confirming a general evil, and by  
subjecting ourselves to our own reproaches*  
as well us to those cf other nations.  
Third. It appears, as well by a letter from  
A|r. Thornton, in answer to one from me,  
of both which copies are enclosed, as from  
conversations with Mr. Merry, that the fa­  
cility winch would be given, particularly  
in t!ie British channel, by the immunity  
claimed for American vessels, to the escape  
of traitors and the desertation of others  
whose services in time of war may be par­  
ticularly important to an enemy, forms one  
of the pleas for the British practice of ex­  
amining American crews, and will be one  
of the objections to a formal relinquishment  
of it.  
This plea, like all the others, admits a solid  
and satisfactory reply. In the first place,  
if it could prevail at all against the neutral  
  
violin, u. vvijum auinnrise.tne seizure ot thft  
persons described only, and in vessels bound  
toa hostile country only ; whereas the prac­  
tice of impressing is applied to persons few,  
it any ot whom, are aUtdgcd to be of either  
description, and to vessels whithersoever  
bound, even to Great Britain herse f in  
the next place, it is not only a preference of  
a smaller object on one side to a greater ob­  
ject on the other ; bat a sacrificexif riglit oa  
one side, to expediency on the other side.

Extract of a Letter from the Secretary of  
State to James Monroe, sq dated 5c h  
of January, W  
We consider a neutral flag, on the  
high seas, as a safeguard to those  
Sailing under it G. Britain, ori&#x27;the  
contrary, asserts a right to search  
for, and seize her own subjects ; and  
under that cover, as cannot but hap

iCitizens of the L&#x27;. States, and citizens  
or subjects of other neutral countries;  
navigating the high seas, under the

Were the right of G. Britain, in5  
this,&#x27; not denied, the abuses flowing  
from it would justify the U. States  
in claiming and expecting a. discon­  
tinuance of its exercise. Biit the  
right is denied. Scon tbtebest grounds.  
Although G. Britain hts not yet  
adopted, in,&quot; the same latitude with  
mos; other nation!, the immunities  
of a neutral ft ig, she will not deny  
thf? general freedom of the high seas4

honty will she find it r In what  
jsage except her own will it be found ?  
tihe will find in both, that a neuiral  
vessel does not protect certain ob  
jects denominated contraband of war,  
including enemies serving in the War,  
iter articlesgoing in a blockaded por&#x27;t,&quot;  
nor as she Itas inaintajned,and as we  
have not contested ehemies proper­

she find an exception to this freedom,  
of the seasj and of neutral flags which  
justifies the taking away of any per.  
son, nut-art enemy ti viuitary stfyic&#x27;i

If treaties, British as well as others,

as it would be appickble to times; of

and to pnbperty as well as to persons.

If the reason alledged for it be good  
In iime&#x27; of war; namelv, tliatahe so-  
veretgn has then a right to the ser­  
vice of all his svtbjects, &#x27;: it &#x27;must be  
good at all times, because at all times  
he;has the s une right to their ser-;  
vice War is not the only occasion  
for which &quot;he may want their ser­  
vices, nor is external Uahger the on­  
ly danger against swhich their ser­  
vices may be required, for his secu­  
rity. Again, if thd authority of a mu­  
nicipal law can operate on persons in  
foreign vessels on the high seas, be  
cause within the dominion of ihetr  
sovereign they would be subject to  
that law, and are violating that law  
by being in- that situation, how re­  
ject the inference that the authority  
of a municipal law may equally be  
enforced, on board foreign vessels,  
on the hicrh seas, acrainst articles of  
prpperty exported m violation of such  
a law, or belonmner to th 5 country  
from which )t was exported I Anu  
thus every commercial regulation, in  
time of peace tooj as well as of wai  
would be made obligatory on foreign  
ers and theif vessels, not only whilst  
within the dominion of the sovereign  
matting the regulation, but in evtry  
ssa, and at every distance where an  
armed vessel might meet with them  
Another inference deserves attention.  
If the subjects of one sovereign mav  
be taken from the vessels of another,  
on the high seas$lhe right of taking  
mem wnen touna, implies me ngnt  
ot searching For them, a vexation o  
commerce, especially in the timeOf  
peace, which has not yet beep:&#x27; at  
tempted, and which for that a wel  
as other reason may be regarded  
as contradicting the priaci pie from  
which it would flow.  
Taking reason and justice for the  
testvof thu practice, it&#x27; is peculiarly  
inaeiensinie ; because it deprives the  
dea est rights of a regular trial, to  
which the rnost inconsiderable arti  
cle of property captured on the high  
seas is entitled ; and leaves their  
destiny to the will of an officer, some  
times cruel- often ignorant, and ge­  
nerally interested by his want of ma­  
riners in his own decisions. Whene­  
ver property found in a neutral ves­  
sel is supposed to he liable on anv  
&#x27;rounds to capture and condemna­  
tion, the rule in all cases is that the  
question shall not be decided by the  
captor, but be carried before a &#x27;legal  
tribunal,- where a regular trial may  
be had, and where the captor hirn-  
seh is liable to damages for such  
abuse of his power Can it be rea­  
sonable then, or just, that a bellige-.  
rent; commander, who is thus res­  
trictedi and thus in a case of mere  
property of trivial amount, should  
be permitted, without recurring to  
any tribunal whatever, to examine  
tjiev crew of a neutral vessel, to de­  
cide the important question of their  
respective allegiances, and to carry  
that decision into instant execution,  
by forcing every individual he may  
ehusjerinto a service abhorrent to his  
feelings, cutting him off from his  
most tender connections, exposing

&#x27;&#x27;The evil takes a deeper die, when  
viewed in its practice as well as its  
principles. Were it allowable that  
British subjects should be talieh out  
of American vessels on the higlljseas,  
it &#x27;might at least be required that the  
proof of their allegianceshould lie On  
the British side. This obviods 8c iust  
rule is however, reversed ; and every  
seaman on board, though going from  
an Amerjcan.port, and sailing undei  
the American flag, and sometimes  
even speaking an idiom proving him  
not to be a British subject, is prtsu  
med to be tucht unless shewn to be  
m American citizen. It may safely  
ie affirmed that -this is an outrage  
ind an indignity which has no prece  
dent, and which G. Britain would be  
among the last nations in (he World  
to suffer, if offered to her own sub J  
jects &#x27;and her o n flag. &quot; Npr is it j  
always against the -ight presump-J  
ion alone, Which is in favor of the ct-  
izenship corresponding with theilag,  
hat the violence is committed. Not  
unfrequehtly it takes placein defi-  
ncc of the most positive proof, cer­  
ified in due form by m American  
uncer. j-iet it not te saHi, tnat in  
granting to American seamen this  
protection to then rights as such, the  
point is yielded, that the proof lies  
.m .the&#x27; American side, and that the  
want of it in the prescribed fotm jus  
tifies the inference that the seamen  
is not of American allegiance. It is  
iistmctly to be understood, that the  
certificate usually called a protection  
o American seamen,&#x27; is not meant  
to protect them under their pwlt, or  
evtn under any other neutral flag on  
the high seas. We can never admit,  
that in such a situation, any other  
protection is required for them, than  
the neutral flag itself on the high  
seas. The document is given to  
prove their real character, in situa­  
tions to which neither the law of na­  
lionsnor the law oftheirown coun­  
try, are applicable ; in other words­  
to protect them within the jurisdic­  
tion of the British laws, and to-secure,  
to them, within every other ju­  
risdiction the rights and immunities  
due to them. , If, in the course of  
their navigation even on the hieh  
seas, the document should have the  
effect of repelling wrongs of any ort?  
it is an incidental advantage only, of  
which they avail themselves and is  
by no means to be misconstrued in  
to a right to exact sucji a proof, &#x27;or  
to make any disadvantageous infe  
rence fromthe want of it.  
Were it even admitted, that cer-  
uncaies ior proiection mignt De just  
ly required in time of waf, from A-  
meriean seamen, they cbuld only be  
required in cases where the lapse of  
time from its commencement had  
given an(opportunity for the Ameri­  
can seamen to provide themselves  
With such a documents Yet it is  
certain,&#x27; &#x27;that in a variety of instan­  
ces, seamep have been impressed  
from Arcierrcan vessels, on the plea  
that they had not this proof of citi­

where its domain would be,abandon  
ed by the general stiDtilation reaul

would be made ot such a sanctuary  
as that of American vessels, for de  
sertions, and traitorous communica­  
tions to her enemies, especially a-  
crqss tlie channel to France.  
1st. With respect to the, British  
seamen serving in our trade, it may  
be remaiked, first, that the number,  
though considerable, is probably less  
than may be supposed. Secondly,  
tha,t what is wrong irt itself cannot be  
made right by considerations of tx  
pediency or advantage. Thirdly,  
that it is proved by the fact that the  
number of real British subjects gain  
ed by the practice In question, is of  
considerable importance even in the  
scale of advantage. The annexed  
report to congress on the subject of  
impressments, with the addition of  
such cases as may be in the hands  
of Mr.Trving, then our consul&quot; in  
Loudon, will verify the remark in its  
application to the present war- The  
I statement made by his predecessor  
nurutg , iijc idsv. war, ana wmcn is  
also annexed, is in the same view  
still more conclusive. The, state­  
merit comprehends not only aft!he  
applications made by, him in the first  
instance, for the liberation of impres  
sed seamen, between the month of  
June, 7$T, and Sept. I SO I, but  
many also which had been made  
previous to . tins agency, by Mr  
rinckney and MH KingV and vyhich  
it was necessary for him to, renew.  
These , applications therefore may  
fairly, pe.. considered as mbraciBg  
the greater part of ihe. period of the  
war ; a;nQ as applications are known  
to be pretty indiscriminately:: made,  
they may further be cohsldeied as:  
embracing if not the whole, ; thenar  
greater part of the impressments,  
those of British subjects as well as  
others, v Yet the result exhibits

wdl and impatience by her neighbors.  
At the last treaty of peace at Amiens,  
the-abolilioh of it was repeatedlyind

not improbable, that at no remote  
day it will follow thq title of 41 JKing

tish Monafchs, and at length so pre-

inagnanimous wisclo.TJ. As far as  
V this homage to the British flag has,  
&#x27; any . foundation at present, it rests&#x27;  
merely on long usage and long ac­  
quiescence&quot;, which are Construed, as in  
.a few otherfiasesof maritime claims,  
5 Mo the effect of a general though  
&quot; tacit convention, The second in­  
stance is the exteiisioivof the territo­  
rial jurisdiction Jto four leagues from  
the shore. this too, as tar as the  
distance may exceed that which is  
generally allowed, rests on a like foUn­  
daticn,&#x27;S!rengthened, perhaps,by the  
local facility of smuggling, rr d the  
&#x27; peculiar interest whiclv G. Britain  
lias in preventing a practice affect­  
ing so Uei-plyhtr whole system of

tures ; whilst the limitation itself to  
four leagues necessarily implies that  
bevond that distance no territorial  
jurisdiction is assumed.  
But whatevef may be the&#x27;origin or  
value of these jprerogatives over fo­  
reign flags in ope case, and within a  
limited portfon cf these seas in apo­  
ther, it is evident that &#x27;neitherof them  
will be violated by the exemption &#x27;of

:This extension of the British law&#x27;  
to four leagues from the shore js. in­  
leixed from an act of Parliament pas-  
sed lathe year 1736 (9 G. 2. C. 35)

-A vessels, foreign as well as British.

With respect to .the compliment  
- a&#x27;d to the B i itisli fl j g, it is a 1 so pos­  
sibie that more is here conceded than  
you may find to be necessary. Af­  
ter the peace of 1TS3, thii cpmpli­  
nent was peremptorily .withheld by  
V ranee, in- spite of.the remonstrances  
of G. Britain ; and it remains for  
Vomv inquiry, whether it did not con-  
inue to be refused, &quot;notwithstanding

We confider a ncutral flag on the high  
{eas as a fafeguard te those failing under it.  
G. Britain, on the contrary, asserts a right  
to search for, and seize her own fubjeéts ;  
and under that cover, as cannot but hap­  
pen, are often seized and taken off, citizens  
of the United States, and citizens or subjects  
of other neutral countries, navigating the  
high seas, under the protection of the Amer­  
ican flag. &gt;  
Were the right of G. Britain, in this, not  
denied, the abases flowing from it would  
juftify the United States in claiming and cx­  
pecting a discontinuance of its exercise.—  
But the right is denied, and on the best  
grounds.  
Although G. Britain has not yet adopted,  
in the fame latitude with most other na­  
tions, the: immaunities of a neutral flag, the  
will not deny the general freedom of the  
high seas, and of neutral veflels navigating  
them, with such exceptions only as are an­  
nexed to it by the law of nations.—She must  
produce then such an exception in the law  
of nations, in saver of the rights the con­  
tends for. But in what written and receiv­  
ed authority will she find it ? In what usage  
except her own will it be found ? She will  
find in both that a neutral veflel does not  
protect certain objects denominated contra­  
band of war, including enemies serving in  
the war, nor articles going in a blockaded  
port, nor as she has maintained, and as we  
have not contested, enemies property of any  
kind. But no where will she find an excep­  
tion to this freedom of the seas, and of neu­  
tral flags which juftifies the raking away of  
any person, not an enemy in military ser­  
vice, found on board a neutral veflel.  
If the subjects of one sovereign may be  
taken from the veflels of another, on the  
high seas, the right of taking them when  
found, implics the right of searching for  
them, a vexation of commerce, especially in  
the time of peace, which has not yet been  
attempted, and which for that as well as  
other reasons, may be regarded as contra­  
dicting the principle from which it would  
flow. &quot;  
Taking reason and justice for the tests of  
this practice, it is_peculiarly indefenfible~  
becaule it deprives the dearest rights of a  
regular trial to which the most inconsidera­  
ble article of property captured on the high  
seas, is entitled ; and leaves their destiny to  
the will of an officer, sometimes cruel, often  
iguorant, and jenerally intcrefed by his  
want of mariners in his own decisions. —  
Whenever property found in a neutral ves­  
sel is supposed to be liable on any grounds  
to capture and condemnation, the rule in  
all cases is that the question shall not be de­  
cided by the captor, but be carried before a  
legal tribunal, where a regular trial may be  
had, and where the captor himfelf is liable  
to damages, for such abuse of his power.—  
.Can it be reasonable, then, orjuft, that a  
belligerent commander, who is thus reftrict­  
cd, and thus in a case of mere property of  
trivial amount, fthould be permitted, with­  
out recurring to any tribunal whatever, to  
examine the crew of a neutral vessel to de­  
cide the important question of their respec­  
tive allegiances, and to carry tha: decision  
into instant execution, by forcing every indi­  
vidual he may chufe, into a service abhor­  
rent to his feelings, cutting him off from his  
most tender conneCions, exposing his mind  
and his person to the most humiliating dis­  
cipline, and his life itfelf to the greatest dan­  
gers 7 Reason, justice and humanity unite  
in prctefting against so extravagant a pro­  
ceeding. And what is the pretext for it ? It  
is that the similarity of language and features be­  
tween American citizens and British fubje®s, are  
Juch as not easily to be diflinguifbed, and that with­  
out this arbitrary and summary autherity to make  
the diffinction, Britifb subjects wwould escape, under  
the name of American citizens from the duty which  
they owe to their sovereign. Is then the diffi­  
culty of diftinguithing a mariper of one  
country from the mariner of the other, and  
the importance of his services, a good plea  
for referring the question whether he be­  
longs to the one or the other, to any arbi­  
trary decision on the {pot, by an interested  
and unrefponfible officer ? In all other cases  
the difficulty and the importance of ques­  
tions are considered as reasons for réquiring  
greater care and formality in invefligating  
th*.n. « To fay that precautions of this fort’  
arc incompatible with. the obje@&amp; is to ad­  
mit the object is unjuftifiable ; since the on­  
ly means by which it can be purfusd are  
such as cannot be juftified.  
The evil takes a deeper die, when view­  
ed in its practice as well as its principles.  
Were it allowable that Britifb fubjedis feould be  
taken out of American wvefels on the bigh seas, it  
might at least be required that the proof of their  
allegiance foould lie on the Britifb fide. - This ob­  
vious and juft’ rule is bowever, reversed ; and eve­  
vy seaman on board, thaugh going from an Ameri­  
can port, and failing under. an American flag, and  
Jometimes even [peaking an idiom psoving bim not  
to be a Britift fubjedd, is presumed to be such, un-.  
-less foenvn to be an American citizen. It may  
Jafely be affirmed that this is an outrage which bas  
no precedent, and wwhich Great-Britain awould be  
-among #be lafl nations&#x27;in the world to fuffer, if  
- offercd on ber own fubjelis and ber own flag.—  
“Nor is it always against the right presump­  
tion alone, which 1s in favor of the citizen­  
ship corresponding with the flag, that the  
‘violence was committed. = Not unfrequent­  
~ly it takes place in defiance of the most posi­  
tive proof, certified in due form by an Amer­  
ican officer. Let it not be said, that in  
granting to American seamen this protec­  
tion&#x27; to their rights as such, the point is  
“yielded, that the proof lieson the American  
fide, and that the want of it in the preferib­  
ed form juftifies the inference that the sea­  
men are not of American allegiance. 7is  
di’ inﬁly to be undesflood, that the certificate ufual­  
ty called a proteciion to American seamen, is. nos.  
meant to proteci them under their own or ‘even un­  
der any other neutral flag on the bigh seas. We  
- cam pever admit, that in such a fitwation,  
| ed}%ther;protc&amp;ion -is required for them,  
‘than the neutral flag itfelf on the high seas.  
- Whether, we cenfult the law of nations,  
or the dictates of ju?;cc, no pretext can be -  
found for the British pratice of making  
-impreflments from American veflels on the  
Mighfeps. - &quot;0k | o R  
gGr{g,g-BritAir_; has the lcfstnﬁ;i‘n&amp;gﬁﬁe

bI&#x27;.I&#x27;AKTKI&#x27;.N&#x27;T Of St/LTK,  
January 5, 1804.  
Sir,—The information and observa*  
tions wiiie.b you have n. yet received  
n me since your aryval in Lon- !  
don, on&#x27;the impressment of otir sea-j  
and other violations of our N  
been in private tetters only.  
The del ty in making these injuries  
the subject of official commuiiicalmns,  
. an expectation  
that tiie Bri i rnment would  
notified formally to the U. States  
, the state of war  
il Britain and Trance,  
:i world have been an ,apt occa­  
sion, for combining with assurances  
of the fairness with which our neutral  
aions would be fulfilled, our1  
just claim, on a correspondent re­  
spect lor our neutral rights, and par- &#x27;  
ticularly of those which had been leas&#x27;  
respected during the last war: bo-&#x27; .  
conttly, from the expected arrival of  
Mr. Merry, which, if he should not .  
, be charged with such a notifioatk  
might be a favoraole opportnnity for!  
commencing the explanations and  
liona which must precede a tho- &#x27;  
rough correction of the wrongs which  
we experience.  
Since the arrival of&quot; Mr. Merry, ■  
accordingly, no time has been lost in y  
calling his attention to the subject ;  
and in preparing both it and him, for  
the negociation which is now to he  
committed to you. If appearances \
arc lo be trusted, his impressions ant!  
representations will be friendly to it. J &#x27;  
In my conversations with him, which I ,  
have been free and full, he has t x-I ,  
pressed the best dispositions, has n  
r.ened with candor to the appeals |  
made, as well to the considerations of j  
justice, as Of the solid interest of  
his nation ; and although he suggests j  
•serious difficulties on certain point.,  
he will, I believe, sincerely co-ope­  
rate in lessening them, and in bring- ,  
ing about an arrangement which will ,  
be acceptable to this country. The  
only topic on which any thing has .  
passed in writing between the depart*  
ment of state and him, is that ol the ■ •  
pretended blockade of St. Domingo. .  
Copies of my letter to him, and of his  
answer, are herewith inclosed ; as  
also of the letter written lo Mr. &#x27; &#x27;  
Thornton, some time before, and re- j  
ferred to in that to Mr. Merry, in re- j  
iation lo a iike blockade of Martinique &#x27;  
and Guadaloupe. [ „  
Although there are many import­  
ant objects which may be thought to ~  
invite conventional regulations be- ,•  
tween the U. Slates and Great Bri- ,  
tain, it is evidently proper to leave for  
subsequent consideration, such as /j  
are ent in their naluic, or  
ie difficult in their adjustment;  
and thereby to render the way plainer  
and shorter to an agreement with re- L,  
spect to objects which cannot he much L.  
longer delayetl without (huiger to the  
good understanding between the two, •  
lonS. With tins view tiie plan of  
a convention contemplated by tiie  
President, is limited to tne cases of  
impressments of our seamen, of j .  
blockades, o. visiting and searching j t  
our vessels, of contraband of war,  
and of the trade vvith hostile colonies, ..  
with a few other cases affecting our w|  
maritime rights; embracing howe- en  
ver, as inducements to Great Britain .)()  
to do us justice therein, a provision .r  
for the surrender of deserting sea- ca]  
men and soe lets, and for the preven- [C}  
tion f contraband supplies&#x27;to her Qj-&#x27;  
enemies.

(el Observations on the preceding /,/.;&gt;.&#x27;•  
THIS lirst article relates to im­  
lC. pressments fro,n American vessels on  
1;r the liigh seas. The commanders of  
,)(1 British armed vessels have, as is  
iie well known, been long in tnis prac-  
J.J tice. &quot;They have indeed not only  
continued it, under tne sanction of  
their su eriois, on the high seas ;  
r9 but have, with impunity, extend;  
.;. Ed it to our own coasts, to n  
M tral ports and lo neutral territory ;  
0t and, in some&#x27; instances, to our  
S) own harbors. The article does not  
tc comprehend these latter cases ;  
ie because it would not be very houora­  
i). ble in Great Britain to stipulate  
i_ against the practice of such enormi*  
u_ ties, nor in the United Slates tore  
&gt;y icur to stipulations as a security a-,  
~ gainst it; and because it may bell  
0f presumed that such particular enor- ]  
a, niities will not be repeated or un- 1  
j. punished, after a general stop shall ]  
■&gt;. have been put to impressments. , &lt;  
9j &#x27;The article, iv its first form, re- i  
j. nounces the claim to take from the &lt;  
»s vessels of the neutral parly, on the 1  
~ high seas, any person whatever, not (  
c in the military service of an enemy j i  
.. an exception which we admit to &lt;  
,r come witiim the law of nationa,on the ;  
subject oi contraband of war. i  
\v itb this ekceptibn, we consider t  
„ a neutral flag on the high seas, as t  
. a safe guard to those sailing under i  
c it. Great Britain, on the contrary, I t  
. asserts a right lo search for, and r  
. seize her own subjects ; and under t  
~ that cover, as cannot but happen, are o  
. often seized and taken off, citizens &#x27;  
, of the United States and citizens or a  
. subjects of other neutral countries C  
, navig.tiug ihe high seas, under the il  
I protection of the American  
Wire the right of Great Britain tt  
1 in this case not denied, the abuses ii  
flowing from it would justify the U- d  
I nitcd Stales in claiming and expect- la  
I ing a discontinuance of its exercise. BI  
,! But the right is denied, and on the et  
. i best grounds. Ie  
.j Although Great Britain has not yet oi  
I ; adopted, in the same latitude with n  
A most other nations, the immunities w  
.j of a neutral flag, she will not de- V  
•ny the general freedom of the high vi  
„&#x27; seas, and of neutral vessels navigat- ai  
I ing them, with such exceptions only, ni  
as are annexed to it, by the law of tl  
nations. She must produce then tl  
such an exception in the law of lc  
nations, in favor of the right she ii  
Contends for. But in what written hi  
and received authority will she al.  
lind it ? In what usage, except her so  
own, will it be found ? She will et  
fitld in both, that a neutral vessel does ai  
not protect certain objects detiomi- pi  
nated contraband of war, including p&lt;  
enemies serving in the war, nor art:- tr  
cles going into a blockaded port ; Cl  
nor, as she has maintained, iftid as v, c: in  
have not contested, enemy&#x27;ft property al  
of any kind. But no where will sue sit  
find an exception to this freedom cv  
of the seas, and of neutral Hags which to  
justifies the taking away ol any per- CU  
son, not an enemy in military ser- de  
vice, found on board a neutral yes- an  
sel. tii:  
It treaties, British as well as others, gr  
are to be consulted on this sub- tic  
ject, it will equally appear that in;  
no countenance to the practice can cc  
be found in them. Whilst ihey ad- foi  
mit a contraband of war, by enume- lai  
rating its articles, and the effect Ai  
lof a real blockade by defining it, in jet  
;no instance do they affirm or imply ■ tin  
a right in any sovereign, to enforce his &#x27; tr.  
claims to ihe allegiance of his subjects, &#x27; tin  
on board neutral vessels, on the high i est  
seas. On the contrary, whenever a ci.  
belligerent claim against persons on om  
I board a neutral vessel, is referred to da.  
lin treaties, enemies in military ser- rin  
j vice alone are excepted from the gene  
neral immunity ol persons in that situ- of  
alion ; and this exception confirms the fit  
immunity of those who are notinclud- lot  
ed in it. an  
It is not then from the law, or the by  
usage of nations, nor from the tenor off  
of treaties, that any sanction can be ty  
delived lor the practice in question, art  
Ami surely it will not be pretended iig  
that the sovereignly of any nation ex- i.  
lends, in any case whatever, beyond ty  
its own dominions, and its own yes- aaj  
sels on the high seas. Such a doc- int  
trine would just alarm to all  
nations, ami more than any tiling sir  
would countenance the imputation of be  
aspiring to an universal empire of the lib*  
seas. It would 1 c the less admis­  
sible too, as it would be applicable nt  
o iin.es of peace as Well as to limes pri  
of war, and to property aswellasi to Bi

lis j persons. If tb.c law of allegiance,  
.n- &#x27; which is a municipal law, be in force  
ns Jat all on the high seas, on board  
ireign vessels, it must be so at all  
j times there, as it is within its acknow­  
l ledged sphere. If the re­  
ed for it be good in time of war,  
&#x27;.&#x27;• namely, that the sovereign has then  
ii- a right to the service of all his sub­  
»&#x27; jc&#x27;tsi it must be good at all times,  
°i beCaO56 al &#x27;&#x27;&quot; times he has the same  
Is right to their service. War is not the  
C- only for which he may want  
iy their serviced &quot; nor is external dan  
of the only dangeY agaihst which their  
; services may be required for his  
-1- security. Again, i&#x27;l the authority of  
i- a municipal law can operate on per­  
; sons in foreign vessels ci. the high  
n* seas, because within the (ion.-&quot;ion of  
-&gt;t their Sovereign they would _*•*&quot; sub-  
J jeet to that law, and are vi  
i- that law by being in that situatio.  
c how reject the inference that  
i- | the authority of a municipal law  
may equally he enforced onboard fo*  
igh vessels on the high seas, against  
c articles of property exported in vio­  
•- lation of such a law, or belonging to  
i- the country from which it was exr  
II ported i And thus every commer­  
, cial regulation, in time ol peace too,  
- as well as of war, would be made  
c obligatory on foreigners and thi  
c vessels, not only whilst within the  
it dominion ofthe sovereign making i  
j regulation, but in every sea, and at  
0 every distance where an armed ves­  
e selmight meet with them. Another  
inference deserves attention. 11 the  
r subjects of one sovereign may be  
s taken hy force from the vesseis of  
r [ another, on Ihe iHgh seas, the right of  
, I taking them, when found, implies the  
1 right pf searching, li v them, a vexa­  
r tion of com i &quot;&gt;..jly in tit  
j of peace, which has pot yet been ;u­  
--&gt; tempted, and widen, tor that as well  
• as other reasons, may be regarded a&quot;?  
, contradicting the principle from which  
; it would How.  
Taking reason aiul justice for ihe  
tests Of this practice, it is peculiarly&#x27;  
indefensible ; because it deprives tee  
dearest rights til* persons, oi a r&lt;  
lar trial, to which the most incon­  
siderable article of property captur­  
ed on &quot;the high seas, is entitled; and  
leaves their destiny to the will &lt; I  
officer, sometimes cruel, oi  
rant, and generally interested by iris

Whenever property found in a neutral  
vessel is supposed lo be liable on  
any grounds to capture and condem­  
nation, the rule in all cases it,  
the question shall not be decided by  
the captor, but be carried before ;\
legal tribunal, where a regular trial  
May be hat!, and where the captor  
himself is liable to damages for an  
abuse of his power. Can it be rea­  
sonable then or just, that a belligerent  
commander who is thus restricted  
and thus responsible in a case of mere  
properly of trivial amount, should be  
permitted, without recurring- to any  
tribunal whatever,- to examine the  
j crew of a neutral vessel, to decide ihe  
j important question of their respective  
allegiances, and to carry that deci­  
sion into instant execution&#x27; by forcing  
every individual he may choose, in­  
to a service ab nor rent to his feeli  
cutting him oil* from his most len­  
der connections, exposing his mind  
and his person to ihe most humiliating  
discipline, and his life itself to the  
st dangers ? Reason, jus­  
tice and humanity unite in protest­  
ing againsl so extravagant a pro­  
ceeding,. And what is the pretext  
for it? It is that the similarity ot  
language and of features, between  
American citizens and British sub­  
jects, are suchas not easily to bedis-  
I tihguiahed ; and that without this aroi-  
J tr_ry and summary authority to make  
! the distinction, British subjects would  
escape under the name of American  
citizens, from ihe duty winch they  
owe to their sovereign. I.s then the  
ulty of distinguishing a ma­  
riner of one country from the mari­  
fthe other and the importance  
of his services, a good plea for re­  
ferring the question whether he he-

seamen servirrg in our I  
-| it may lie remarked first, lhat the  
i number, though considerable, ispro­  
; bably less than may be supposed. Se­  
i condly, that what is wrong in itself  
, connot be m idera­  
: tions of expediency or advantage.  
1 Thirdly, that it is proved by the fact,  
, that the number of real British sub­  
i jects gained by the practice in quos­  
, tioii, is 6f inconsiderable importance,  
) even in the scale of advantage. The

; &#x27; dition of such case be in the  
1 hands of Mr. ErVing, will verify ike  
. remark in its v to the pre­  
j sent war. The statement made by  
&gt; his predt last war,  
i and Whl i annexed, is in the  
- same view stilt on i live. The  
■ment coi • bot only all

■ of June, 1797, and-September,  
i Which had been made

■ ney and Mr. King, and which i  
,to renew. These  
■ appli therefore may fairly be  
I con : .g the greater  
f part ol the period ofthe war; and as  
i appli i to be pretty &#x27;  
i indiscriminately made, they may fur­  
ther he considered as embracing, if  
not the whole, the»*far greater p  
• the impressments, those of B  
.•cts as weil as others. Ye  
i result exhibits 2,0;, 9 cases only, and  
, of this number, 103 scarfnen only de­  
tained&#x27;as being Bri cts, which  
• is less than 1-20 of the number im­  
pressed, and 1 142 ■ dor or­  
dered to be so, as not being British  
subjects, which is more that) half of  
the whole number, leavsiig gOS for  
i farther proof, with the strongest pre­  
sumption thai iter part, if not  
the whole, were Americans or other  
aliens, who-c proof of citizenship had  
been lost or destroyed, or whose situ­  
ation would account for the difficul­  
ties and delays in producing it. So  
■ that it is certain, thai for all the Bri­  
tish seamen gained by this violent  
proceeding, mote than an equal num­  
ber who wer&#x27;- not so, were the vie­  
■ tims. It is highly probable that for  
every British so gained, a  
number of others not less than ten  
for one must have been the vi.  
ami it is even possible that this num­  
ber may have exceeded the propor­  
tion of twenty to one.  
It cannot therefore he doubted,  
that the acquisition of British seamen  
by these impi, , whatever may  
be its advantage, is lost in the v.  
done to Amcr; orantly or wil­  
fully mistaken for British subjects;  
in the jealousy and ill wjll excited a­  
aiong-all maritime nations by an ad­  
herence tt&gt; such a practice ; and in  
the particular provocation to mea­  
sures of redress on the partdf the U.  
States, not less disagreeable to them  
than embarrassing to Great Britain,  
ami which may threaten the good un­  
derstanding which ought to be faith­  
fully cultivated by both. The copy  
of a bib brought into Congress under  
the influence of violations committed  
on our flag, gives force tt) this latter  
consideration. Whether it will pass  
into a law, and at the present see*  
sion, is more than yet can be said. As  
there is every reason to believe that  
it bus been proposed with reluctance,  
it will probably hot be pursued into  
I, if any hope can be supported,  
of a remedy by an amicable arrange­  
ment between the two nations. But  
such is ihe lee ,-;gh this coun­  
try, produced by the reiterated and  
attOcioUs cases of impressments anil  
otiier insults on our flag, tnat a re­  
medy of some kind will ere lon  
called for in a tone not to be disre­  
garded) A copy of the bill referred  
to is lierewitli inclosed.  
There is a further considers  
which ought to have weight in this  
question. Although the British sea­  
men employed in carrying on Ame­  
rican com pierce, be in some respects  
lost to their own nation, yet such is  
the intimate and extensive connexion  
:, direct and ci  
tons, with the commerce, the manii­  
factut evenueand the general  
of the British nation,  
in other i, its marim i  
I may truly be  
s.iid to be rendering it the most valu­  
able services. It would not be extra­  
ike ii a question, i  
ther G. Britain would not suffer more  
&#x27;• by withdrawing her seamen from ihe  
j merchant vessel* of the U. St  
than her enemies Would suffer I  
the addition of them to the crews of  
her snips oi war and cruia  
&#x27;ted con­  
the Bri­  
tish dotnii liuralized by  
the L reaty of l 7ti.i,  
you may ret;  
very few il any se&lt;  
ralizations can take place-, the law  
here requiring a preparatory rcsi- j  
  
dence of five years, with notice ofthe ]  
intention to become a citizen entered i  
of record two years before the last  
necessary formality, besides a regu­  
lar proof of good moral character,  
conditions little likely to be complied  
with by ordinary seafaring peisons.  
Secondly, that a discontinuance of  
impressments on the high seas will  
preclude an actual collision between  
the interfering claims. Within the  
. jurisdiction of each nation, and in  
their respective vessels on the high  
1) will enforce the allegiance  
which it claims. In other situations,  
individuals doubly claimed will be  
, within a jurisdiction independent of  
hot h nab  
2d. The British pretensions to do­  
, main over the narrow Seas arc so ob­  
: solete, anil so indefensible, that they  
■ never would have occurred as a pro­  
bable objection in this case, if they  
. had not actually frustrated an ar­  
! range ment settled by Mr. King with  
• , iiustry, on the subject  
of impressments bom Amcrkan ves­  
oh tiie high seas. At the mo­  
ment when the articf s wcreexpected  
to be signed, an exception of the  
&quot; narrow seas&quot; was urged and insist­  
ed on by lord St. Vincent, and being  
. utterly inadmissible on our part, the  
.on was abandoned. Mr.  
io,;; seems to be of opinion, how­  
ever, that with more time than was  
left hi,n for the experiment, the ob-  
Hlight have been overcome.  
&#x27;This is not improbable, if the objec­  
tion was not merely an expedient for  
evading a relinquishment of a favo­  
rite practice,  
j The objection in itself has certain­  
ly not the slightest foundation.  
• time lias been indeed, wiicnl&#x27;b,  
• not only claimed but exercised pre*  
cely inferior U&gt; lull Seve­  
nty over thesea§ surrounding die  
■ ,ii isies, and even asfaras Cape  
tq &#x27;.he south, and Vansiaten  
y, to the north. It \
time however, win had iittie  
share in determining the law and the  
intercourse of nations; when power  
■ alone decided questions of right; and  
wiien tne ignorance ami want of con­  
cert among other maritime countries  
facilitated sticn an usurp,,don. The  
progress of civilization and informa­  
tion has produced a change in all  
respects, and no principle in  
the &#x27;ode. of public law, is at present  
belter established, than the common  
freedom of the seas, beyond a very  
limited distance from the territa  
washed by them. This distance is  
not indeed fixed with absolute preci­  
sion. It is varied in a small degree  
by written authorities ; and perhaps  
it may be reasonably varied, iv some  
degree, by local peculiarities, But  
the greatest distance which wouid  
now be listened to any where, would  
make a.small proportion of the nar­  
rowest part of the narrowest seas in  
I ion.  
What arc in fact the prerogatives  
claimed and exercised by G. Britain  
over these seas &#x27;( If they were real­  
ly a pan of her domain, her authori­  
ty would be the same there as within  
her other domains. Foreign vessels  
would be subject to ail the laws and  
llattons framed for them, as much  
us v i hey were within llie harbors or  
rivers of the country. Nothing of  
this sort is pretended. Nothing of  
this sort would be tolerated, &#x27;lite  
only instances in which these seas aie  
distinguished from oilier *eas, or in  
which Great Britain enjoys within  
them any distinction over other na­  
tions, are first, the compliment paid  
by other flags to hers ; secon&amp;iy, the  
Usion ot her territorial jurisdic­  
tion in certain cases to the distance of  
four leagues from the coast. Tne  
first is a relic of ancient usurpa­  
tion, which has thus long escaped &#x27;  
the correction, which modern and  
more enlightened nines liave applied  
to o her usurpations. The preroga- i  
live has been often contested howe- j  
ver, even at tlic expence ol bioody I  
wars, and is sibi borne with ill will !  
and impatience by her neighbors. At  
the last treaty of peace at Amiens, !  
the abolition of it was repeatedly and  
strongly pressed by France, ami it is  
not improbable that at no remote way  
it will follow the iate of tiie title of j  
gof I-ranee&#x27; so long worn by  
the British monarchs, and at length I  
Operly sacrificed to toe lessons  
of a magnanimous wisdom. As fir  
as tin a homage to tne British flag has  
any foundation al present, it rests  
merely on long usage and long ac­  
quiescence, which are construed, as  
in a few other Cases of .maritime  
claims, into tiie effect oi&#x27; a  
thou lion. &#x27;The second  
instance is the extension of Die terri­  
torial jurisdiction to four leagues from  
the shore. This too, as far .as tne  
distance may exceed thai which is  
ally allowed, rests on a like  
i, strengthened perhaps by  
the local facility of smuggling, and  
the peculiar interest which ti. Britain  
i preventing a practice affecting  
so deeply her whole system o| reve­  
nue, commerce and manufactures,  
whilst the limitation itseil to loin  
ccssuriiy implies that, be­  
yond i hat distance no territorial juris­  
diction is asstimed.  
But whatever may he the origin or  
the value of these prero over  
I foreign flags in one case, and within a &#x27;  
  
1 limited portion of these seas in ano- j  
I ther, it is obvious that neither of  
them will be violated by the exemp­  
tion of American vessels from im­  
pressments, which are no wise con­  
nected with cither, having never been  
made on the pretext either of with­  
holding the wonted homage to the  
British Hag, or of smuggling in defi­  
ance of British laws.  
This extension of the British law ]  
to four leagues from thcshorc is in­  
ferred from an act of parliament pass­  
ed in the year IT3$, (9 G. 2 C. 35)  
the terms of which comprehend all  
vessels, foreign as well as British.  
It is possible, however, that the for­  
mer are constructively excepted.  
■ Should your inquiries ascertain this  
&gt; to be the case, you will find yourself  
lon belter ground than the concession  
■ i here made.  
With respect to the compliment  
■ paid to the British Hag, it is also pos­  
&#x27; siblc that more is here conceded than  
: you may find to be necessary. After  
the peace of 17 B.&#x27;l, this compliment  
was peremptorily withheld by Prance,  
in spite of the remonstrances of G.  
Britain ; and it remains for your in­  
quiry, whether it did not continue to  
be refused, notwithstanding the fai­  
lure at Amiens to obtain from Great-  
Britain a formal renunciation of the  
claim.  
from every view of the subject it  
is reasonable to expect, that the ex-&#x27;  
ception of the narrow seas, from the  
stipulation against impressments, will  
not be inflexibly maintained. Should  
it be so, your nt on will he at  
an end. &#x27;The&#x27;truth is, that so great  
a proportion of our trade direct and  
circuitous passes through those chan­  
nels, ami such is its peculiar expo­  
sure in them lo the wrong pracb  
thai. w»th such an exception, any re­  
medy would he very partial. And  
we can never consent to purchase a  
partial remedy by confirming a gene­  
raievil, and by subjecting ours  
to our own reproaches, as well as lo  
those of other nations.  
3d. It appears as well by a let:  
from Mr. Thornton, in answer to one  
from me, of both which copies are  
inclosed, as from conversations with j  
Mr. Merry, that the facility which!  
would be given, particularly in the  
British channel, by the immunity j  
claimed lor American vessels, to the |  
escape of traitors, ami the desertion!  
of others whose services in timi  
War may be particularly important to]  
an enemy, forms One of the pie,is for,  
the British practice of examining  
merican crews, and will be on  
the objections to a formal relinquish­  
ment of it.  
Tiiis plea, like all others, ad  
a solid and satisfactory reply. In ihe  
first place, if it com&#x27;d pi  
gainst the neutral claim, it would  
thorise the seizure of li&#x27;o pei  
described only, and in vessels bound,  
to a country only ; win  
the practice of impressi ig is ap]  
. few if any of whom are al- |  
lodged to be of either description, I  
and to essels Wl .soever bound,  
even to Great Briuin herself. In the,  
next place, il is not only a preferi  
of a smaller object on one side to aj  
greater object on the other; but a:  
sacrifice of right on one side, to ex­  
pediency on the other side.  
Considering, nevertheless, the p  
sible adherence ol the British govern- j  
ment to this last objection, und  
extreme importance to our sea-faring &#x27;  
citizens and commerce, of a stipula­  
tion suppressing a practice flagrant in I  
i.s nature, and slid more suit;  
abuses inseparable from it, you  
left at liberty to concur, if nee  
ry, in the modification as it stands in I  
the second column. You nib observe ,  
that ibis guards, in all CaSes, the  
&quot;I&quot; our vessels from Icing med­  
dled with ; and in referring for an  
exception to the immunity on board  
i otar vessels to the law of nati  
j yields no principle maintained by the ,  
; V. States ; inasmuch as the refet  
! will he satisfied by toe acknowledged  
exception of enemies in military  
&#x27;&lt; vice. Should persons therefore, o- j  
ban such, he taken under1 pre*]  
j text of the 1 ,vv of nations, the United  
j States will be free I die pro-!  
j ceeding, and there is the leas diflicul- j  
;ty in leaving the stipulation on this &#x27;  
I fooling, as the case may never hap­  
! pen, and will be pretty sure to happen  
but rarely. Yon will observe also,  
that in the passage from one port to  
aftoi her of the rt spectiye counti  
the •, the neutral parties arc j  
to protect all person, without exeep- j  
tion. Independently of the general!&#x27;  
principle asserted by the U. Slate*?; ; ■  
&#x27;Ine to ihe peculiar -  
rof coasting trade, and ihe &#x27;  
utter improbability that it will at any  
time he a vehicle to persons of any | &#x27;  
. (  
On Article 11. &#x27;The rt ness ! &#x27;  
of ibis article is manifest. Citizens.P  
or subjects of one eounity residii  
ter, though bound by their tempo- &#x27;  
i*ary i ■ to many common dv- 1  
can never be light fully forced in- I  
to military service, particularly exter- &#x27;  
fvne, nor be restrained from i  
leaving llicjr residence when they;]  
please. &#x27;The law of nations prolecis &lt;  
them against both, ami &quot;flic violation j &#x27;  
of this law by the avowed imp&#x27;  
ment of American citizens residing in 1  
Great Britain, may be pressed with j {  
  
I the greater force on the British  
vernment, as it is in direct inconsist­  
ency with her impressment of her  
on subjects bound by much strong­  
er ties to the United Statec, as above  
explained, as well as with the spiril of  
her commercial laws and policy, by  
which foreigner, are invited to a re­  
sidence. The&#x27;liberation ofthe per­  
sons comprehended by this article,  
therefore, cannot be justly or honor­  
ably refused, and the provision for  
their recompenre and their rt turn  
home, is equally due to the service  
rendered by, and the wrong done to  
them.  
On Article 111. This regulation is  
conformable to the law of nations, and  
to the tenor of all treaties.which de­  
fine the belligerent claim of visiting  
and searching neutral vessels. No  
treaty can be cited in which the prac­  
tice of compelling the neutral \
to send its boat, its officers, its p  
or its papers, to the belligerent vessel,  
is authorized. British treaties, as  
well as those it) winch she is not a par­  
ty, in every instance where a regula­  
tion of the claim is undertaken, 00-iri*  
cidc with the article here proposed.  
The article is in f„Ct almost a frans­  
criptofl article ofthe treaty of  
1786 between Great Britain and  
France.  
The regulation is founded in the  
one. Ist, .tcicnt for  
the neutral that he .acquiesces in the  
interruption of his voyage, and the  
trouble of lite examination, imposed  
by the belligerent commander. To  
Hire c, positive and active, co-ope­  
ration on lib- par. in behalf ofthe lat­  
ter, is more than can be justified on  
any principle. 2d. The belligerent  
party .note conveni­  
ently to the neutral vessel, than this  
lend to the belligerent vcssel&gt;  
having, neither such tH boats for the  
purpose, especially in a rough sea,  
nor being so abundantly manned. 3d.  
This last i ion is enforced by  
the numerous and cruel abuses com­  
mitted ill I&#x27;h.e practice of requiring the  
neutral vessel to send to the beilige-­  
reut. As an example you will find in  
locnmeirts vow ed, a case  
where 11. ii&#x27;.ia- the smallness and h-a­  
nor the boisterous  
of tne weather, nor the pathetic  
of the neutral com­  
• ly effect on the impari­  
i ous injunctions ofthe belligerent, and  
where the task was performed at the.  
[fest peril ofthe boat, the papers,  
I and ,k; lives of th. people. &#x27;The li-

These views of the subject have j  
re I into my bonversations with  
.Mr. Merry. He I, notwith­  
si ci tin \-, tt belief that Gretit Britain  
will turn,an unfavorable car to any  
proposition calculated to give her ene­  
mies the resources of their colonial  
it i!:, beyond the degree in which her  
rmit. This   
doubtles ito b nded, but con­  
sideringthe proposition as an article  
which may find a balance in the ge­  
neral bargain, it may not be inadmis­  
sible ; or if inadmissible in tiie extent  
proposed* a middle ground may per­  
haps be I, &#x27;Site colonial  
trade iv t of four,  
branches ; first, between the colonies }  
and Great Britain herself; secondly, I

the trade; fourthly, between the colo-&#x27;  
nies and the countries to which they  
belpng, or which arc parties to the,  
war with Great Britain.  
The first and second branches are  
those with which her own regulation  
accord. &#x27;The last is that lo which*  
her aversion will of course be the  
(Strongest. Should this aversion be  
unconquerable, let it be tried then,  
and then only, whether on our yield­  
ing, or rather omitting that point,  
she will not yield to us in return, the  
direct trade between hostile colonies  
and neutral countries generally. You  
will be careful, however, so to modify  
the compromise as will mark as little  
as may be, a positive relinquishment  
ofthe direct trade between the belli­  
gerent nations and their colonies.  
Should such a compromise be alto­  
gether rejected, you will limit the ar­  
ticle to the simple enumeration of  
contraband, it being desirable that  
vvitliouta very valuable consideration,  
no precedent should be given by the  
United States of a stipulated acknow­  
ledgment that free ships do not make  
free goods. And you will omit the  
article altogether, if a proper list of  
contraband cannot be agreed on, par­  
ticularly one that excludes money,  
provisions and naval stores.  
On At pule V. This article taken  
from the convention of 1800, between  
the United States and France, is con- .  
Id aiutbie to the general practice ofthe  
prize courts _n the latter, and is the  
more worthy of adoption every where,  
as it would contribute so much to the  
consistency and stability of the rules  
©f admiralty proceedings. Without  
a single objection justly lying against  
it, it will have the important advan­  
tages of being a check on the inferior  
tribunals, of enabling the superior  
tribunal where a faulty reason ap­  
pears on the lace of the sentence, lo  
correct the wrong without delay or  
expense, and of being a check moreo­  
ver on the decision of the superior  
tribunal itself. As prize causes also  
are tried by courts not ot a third party,  
buUol&quot;one ofthe parties interested, it  
is but reasonable that the ground  
should be known to the otiier dn which  
judgment has passed against its citi­  
zens or subjects, in order, if deemed  
proper, that negotiation may be em­  
ployed for redressing past or guard­  
ing against future injustice.

is j It is not certain what degree of va­  
lue Great Britain may put 0.1 this  
lC article, connected, as it essentially  
,]t 1 is, with the article Which limits the  
•0 I list ol contraband. It will at (cast  
1C I mitigate her objection to such a li-  
Q( j mitation. With the range given to  
|c contraband by her construction of lha  
~. law of nations, even as acquiesced in ]  
c [by the U. States, a stipulation of this j  
1S I sort would be utterly inadmissible.  
j. f The last article, in making this  
[c city the place for exchanging the  
ratifications, expedition  
ie in polling the treaty into ope­  
c ration, since the British ratification  
j can be forwarded tit the same time  
j. with tne instrument itself. And it is  
v otherwise reasonable, that as the ne­

ph.ee Bluish armed vessels, with

l«l« What would probably be done by  
ln gratuitous regulafions here, and as  
it would no doubt be acceptable to  
Great Britain, it may not Only aid  
in reconciling her to the principal ob­

gulate more precisely and more ef­  
ually, the trcitnit-nt 01 yes- &#x27;  
ot ihe neutral-party on the high

The occasion will be proper also, 1  
. for cailini; the attention of the Brit  
I lish government to the reasonable- j  
ucss of permitting American cou­  
nt reside in every part of her s  
, dominions, where, and so long- as she  
permitst&gt;uTr citizens to trade. It is not &lt;  
denied that she has a natural right &lt;  
to reiUso such a residence, and that t  
[ sue is free by her treaty with us, &lt;  
to refuse it in othci than her Ku- S  
ropean dominions. But the ex- a

temporary admission of consuls to Vi

Gcj.artn/uit oj State, Jan. 5, 180$  
* Pin, &#x27; i  
I he miormationar.il observation which you have  
as yet received from Inc since your arrival in Lon­  
don, on the impressment of our seamen and other  
yiol.tiions ol «.ur rights, have hren on private let­  
ters only. The delay in m king these injuries the  
Sin jut ol olluial communications, pruned,d, first  
trom an expectation that the British, government  
would have notified formally to the United&#x27; States  
ns a uetriral power, the state of&#x27; war between Great  
Br;t..in and t rance,.&#x27;&#x27;which would have been an apt  
wcdsioif, for comhifling with assurances of the  
fairness with which our neutral obligations would?  
be fulfilled, our just claim on u correepondent re­  
spect lor our neutral lights, and particularly of.  
those which had been least respected during the last  
war: secondly, from the expected arrival of Mr.&#x27;  
Merry, which, if l.e should not be charged with  
such a uotifi. ation, might he a favourable opportu­  
nity lor conmii-niTiig the explanations and discussi­  
ons which must precede a thorough correction of  
the wrongs whit h we experience.  
Snce I l.e ai rival of Mi. Mtny, accordingly, no  
tune has been lost in call.ng his attention to the  
subject ; aim in preparing both it and him, for the  
n gnuiion which is now to be committed to you..  
It appealac,ces are to he trusted, his impressions.;  
aril representations will be friendly to ig, In my  
conversations with him, which have been free and  
  
expressed ti,e best dispositions, has lis­  
tfr.rd wul. candour to the appeals made, a* well to  
the*eonsaK rations of johtiee, as of the solid inte­  
r. st nl Ins nation ; and although he suggests, seri­  
oos difncultics on certain points,&#x27; he will, f believe,  
sincerely co-operate m lessening them,und in bring­  
ing about an arrangement which will he acceptable  
to this country. I he only lopick on which any  
thing has passed in writing between the department  
(rf state and him, is that of the pretended blockade  
of St.’Domingo. Copies of my letter to him and  
ol his a ns wes, are herewith inclosed ; as also of the  
1 letler written to Mr. Thornton, some time before,;  
and referred to in that of Mr. Merry, in relation to  
alike blockade of Martinique and Guadaloupe.  
Although there are many important objects  
•which may be thought to invite conventional’regu­  
lations bet ween the United States and Great Britain,&#x27;  
it is evidently proper to leave for subsequent -consi­  
deration, .such as are less urgent iu their nature, or  
^ more difficult in their adjustment; and thereby to  
render the way plainer and shorter to an agreement  
with respect to objects which cannot be much lon­  
ger delayed without danger to tjie good understand­  
ing between the two nations. With this view the  
plea of a convention contemplated by the president,  
is limitted to the case of impressments of our sea­  
men, of blockades, of visiting and searching our1  
vessels, of contraband of war, and of the trade with

&#x27;Obeervations on the preceding ﬂlan.  
The first article relates to impressments  
&quot;from American vessels on the high seas.—­  
The commanders of British armed vessels  
have, as is .well known, been long in this  
practice. They have indeed not only conti­  
inuedctit, under the sanction of their superiors,  
si on the high seas; but have, with impunity,  
extended it to our own coasts, to neutral  
ports and to neutral ssterritory ; and, in some  
_ ihstances, to our own harbors. The article  
does not comprehend these latter cases ; be­  
cauctse it would not be very honorable in Great  
Bl&#x27;itain to stipulate against the practice of  
such enormities, nor in the Unitedsi States to  
recur to stipulations as a security against it ;  
-si-and because it may be presumed that such  
si&#x27;particniar enormities will not be repeated or  
unpunished, after a general stop shall have  
  
ss been put to i-mpres&#x27;sments.  
&quot; . &quot; The article, in its first form, renounces the  
claim to take from the vessels of the neutral  
&quot;party, on the high seas, any person whatever,  
ss not in the military service of an enemy ; an  
exception which we admit to come within the  
.ss law of nations, On the subject of contraband of  
&#x27; war-. ct - si _  
sisiss si lVith-this exception, si we consider a ncutral  
sjﬂagsion the high seas, as a safe guard to those  
sluiling under it. Great-Blitain, on the con­  
trary, asserts a right to search for, and seize  
ss_&#x27;-.sssshsser ownctsssubjects; and under that cover, as ss  
siss cannot—inn happen, are often seized and taken  
oﬀ, citizens of the United States, and citizens  
or subjects of other neutral countries navigat­  
ing the high seas, under the protection ofthe  
American ﬂag.  
Were the right of Great Britain in this  
case not-denied, the abuses ﬂowing from it  
&#x27;sswoulsid justify the United States in claiming  
&quot;and expecting a discontinuance of its exer­  
cise. But the right is denied, and on the best  
tsissgrounds. _  
- &#x27; &#x27;ctAlthosiugzh G. Britain has not yet adapted  
in the sinne latitude, with most other nations  
&#x27; the immunities ot&#x27;a neutral fiag, she will not  
&quot;&quot; thany the general freedom of the high seas,  
and ofneutral vessels navigating them, with  
ss such exceptions only, as are annexed to it by  
the law of nations She must produce then  
such an exception in the law of nations, in  
savor Qf—the right she contends for. But in :  
what written and received authority will she &#x27;  
find it! in what usage except her own will it r  
&#x27; be found ? She will find in both, that a neutral ss  
vessel doth not protect certain Objects deno- -  
minated contraband of war, including enemies &#x27;ss  
&#x27;ctctsisiserving in tue war, nor articles going into a  
fsssshlockaded port; nor as she has mai&#x27;ttained, ,  
and as We have not contested, enemy&#x27;s pro_- &amp;  
per-tye!&quot; any kind. But no where will she 3  
sssifind an exception to this freedom of the seas, f  
&quot;and ofneutral ﬂags which justifies the taking ss  
away of any person, not an enemy in military ;  
&#x27;- service, found on board a neutral vessel. ]  
  
&#x27; if treaties, British as well as others, are to ?  
&quot;&quot;be consulted on this subject, it will equally  
appear that ,no countenance to the practice  
— can be found in them. VVhilst they admit &amp;  
simnfraband of war, by enumerating its al&#x27;tiClCS,  
and the eﬀects of a real blockade by defimng  
&#x27; it, in no instance do they affiim or imply a  
right in any sovereign, to enforce his claims  
sito the allegiance of his subjeccs, on board neu­  
&#x27;ct tra] vessels, on&quot; the high seas. On the contra­  
r ry,-whenever a belligerent claim against per­  
&#x27; sans on board a neutral vessel, is referred to  
&quot;in-trance, enemies in military service alone  
&#x27; are ex&#x27;ceptEd from the general immunity of  
&quot; _ rsons in that sitoatiou ; and this exception  
confirms the immunity of those who are not  
sincluded in it.  
  
- - - 7 - P  
  
  
It is not then from the law, or the usage on  
nations, nor from the tenor of treaties, that  
any sanction can be derived from the practice  
ssin question. And surely it will not be pre­  
&#x27;atendetl that the sovereignty of any nation ex­  
— tends, in any case whatever. beyond its own  
&#x27;dorninions, and its own vessels on the high  
,ss ctSeas. Such a doctrine would give jusc alarm  
to all nations, and more than any thing would  
countenance the imputation of aspiring to an  
universal &quot;empire of the seas. It would be  
* the less admissible too, as it would be applica­  
si_ct._blesi to times of peace as well as to times of  
fwar, and to property as well as to persons.  
lf the law of allegiance, which is a muni—  
ctcipal laW, be in force at all onfthe high seas,  
on board-forcign vessels, it must be so at all  
fimesctthere, as it is within its acknowledged  
sphere. If the reason alledged for&#x27;it be good  
in time of .war, namely, that the sovereign  
&#x27; &#x27;- has then a right to the service of all his sub­  
iLCT-Sz it must be good at all times, because at  
Ill time he has the same right to their service.  
Warsils not the only occasion for which he  
may Want their services; nor is external dan­  
BPY the only danger against which their serct­  
&quot;(?-5 tnay be required for his security. A­  
, &quot; Wsi- sictshb authority of a municipal law can  
w ?&quot; person; in fqreigu vessels on the.  
  
l  
  
  
high seas, þecause within- the &#x27;ssdsiominion of  
their sovereign they- w0uld—be subject to that  
law, and are violating that law by being in  
that Situation; how rejcct the inserence that  
the authority&#x27;ol&#x27; a municipal law may equally  
be enforced on board.foreign vessels on the  
high seas, against .articles &#x27; experted in  
violation of such a law, or belonging to the  
country from which it was exported? And  
thus every commercial regulation, in time of  
peace too, as well as of war, would be made  
obligatory on foreigners and their vessels-, not  
only whilst within the dominion of the sove­  
reign making the regulation, but in every sea,  
and at every distance where my armed vessel  
might meet with them. Another inserence  
deserves attention. If the subjects of one  
sovereign may be taken by force from the  
vessels of another, on the high seas, the  
right of taking them, when found, implies  
the right of searching for them, a vexation  
of commerce, especially in time of peace,  
which has not yet been attempted, and which,  
for that as well as other seasons, may be re­  
garded as contradicting the principle from  
which it would ﬂow.  
T aking reason and justice for the tests of  
this practice, it is peculiarly indesensible; be­  
cause it (leprives the dearest rights of persons  
of a regular trial, to which the most inconsi­  
derable article of property captured on the  
high seas, is entitl-C&#x27; ; and leaves their desti  
ny—to the will of an officer, sometimes cruel,  
often ignorant. and generally interested by  
his want of mariners, in his own decision.—  
  
__—____  
  
VVhenever property toand in a neutrat VCSSC]  
is supposed to be liable on any grounds to  
capture and condemnation, the rule in all ca­  
ses is, that the question shall not be decided  
by the captor, but be carried before a legal  
tribunal,where a regular trial may hehad,  
and where the captor himself is liable to da­  
mages for an abuse of his power. Can it be  
reasonable then or just, that a belligerent  
commander who is thus restricted and thus  
responsible in a case of mere property ot&#x27;tri­  
  
: vial amount, should be permitted, without  
  
si_recurring to any tribunal whatever, to exa­  
  
!  
  
mine the crew of a neutral vessel to decide  
the important question of their respective al­  
legiances, and to carry that decison into in­  
stant execution by forcing- every individual he  
may choose into a service abhorrent to his  
feelings ; cutting him oﬀ from his most ten­  
der connections, exposing his mind and his­  
person to the most humiliating discipline, and  
his life itself to the greatest danger-s. Rea­  
son, justice and hiunanity unite in promoting!  
against so extravagant a proceeding. And  
what is the pretext for it ? It is that the si­  
milarity of language and of features, between  
American citizens and British subjects, are  
such as not easily to be distinguished . and  
that without this arbitrary and summary au­  
thority to make the distinction, British sub­  
jects would escape under the name of Ameri­  
can citizens, from the. duty which they owe to  
their sovereign. Isss then the difficulty of  
distinguishing a mariner of one country from  
the mariner of the other and the importance  
of his services, a good plea for referring the  
question whether he belongs to one or to the  
other, to an arbitrarssv decision on the spot, by  
an interested and irresponsible officer ? In  
all other cases, the (lifiiculty and the impor­  
tance of questions are considered as reasons  
for requiring greater care and fermality in in­  
vestigating them. and greater security for a  
right decision on them. To say that precau­  
tions of this sort are incompatible with the ob­  
&#x27;ect, is to admit that the object is un justiliable,  
since the only means by which it can be pur­  
sued are such as cannot be justified.  
The evil takes a deeper die when view-ed in  
its practice as well as its principles. Were it  
allowable that British subjects should be taken  
out of American vesselson the high seas, it.  
might at least be required that the proof of  
their allegiance should lie on the British side.  
This obvious and just rule is however revers­  
ed, and every seaman on board, though going  
from an American port anc1 sailing under the  
American Rag, and sometimes even speaking  
an idiom proving him not to be a British  
subject, is presumed to be such, unless shewn  
to be an American citizen. It may safely be  
affirmed that this is an outrage and an indig­  
  
\
  
  
nity which has no precedent, and w: icn Lz.  
Britain would be among the last nations in  
the woxld to suﬀer it oﬀered to her own sub—  
jects, and her own fiag Nor is it always  
against the right presumption alone, which is  
in favor of the citizenship correspondinssr with  
the ﬂag, that the tiolcnce is committed. Not  
unirequentl} it takes place in defiancc of tl e  
most positivc proo , ccsitified in due .m m by  
an Ame ican officer. Letsi it not be said that  
in granting to American seamen this protec­  
tion sortheir rights as such, the point is yield­  
ed that the proof lies on the American side,  
and that the want of it in the pr esc1ibed form  
justifies the insert-since that the scaman is not  
of American allegiance. it is distinctiy to  
be understood, that the certificate usually  
called a protection to American seamcn, is  
not to protect them under their own, or et,-en  
any other neutral ﬂag on the high seas. We  
can never admit, that in such a Situation, any  
other protection is required for them than the  
nentralsifiag on the high seas. T he document  
is given to prove their real character, in Situa­  
tions to which neither the lawssctof nations nor  
the law of— their own countiy are applicable.  
in other words to protect them within the  
jurisdictionos the British laws, and to seem-e  
  
  
: to them, within every other &#x27;jurisdiccttion,sithe_  
&#x27;. rights and immunities due to them. &#x27;If in the  
course of their navigation even on the high  
seas, the document should have the eﬀect of  
repelling wrongs of any sort, it is an inci­  
dental advantage only Of WhiCh they avail  
themselves, and is by no means to be miscon­  
strued into a right to exact such a proof, 01&#x27; tOct  
make ctdisadvantageous inisierence from the  
want , .  
Were it even admitted that certificates for  
protection might be justly required in time of  
war from American seamen, they could only  
be required in cases where the lapse of time  
from its commencement had given an oppor­  
tunity for the American seamen to &#x27;provide  
themselves with such a document, Yet lt is  
certain that in a variety of instances, seemen  
have been impressed from American vessels,  
on the plea that they had not this proof of ci­  
tizenship, when the dates and places of the  
impressment, demonstrated the imp&#x27;ossibility  
of their knowing, in time to provide the  
proof, that a state of war had rendered it ne­  
cessary. - ss  
&#x27;t-Vhether, therefore, we consnlt the law of  
nations, the tenor of treaties or the dictates of  
reason and justice, no warrant, no pretext  
can be found for the British practice of mak— :  
ing impressment from Ameriean vessels on I  
the high sees.  
  
v—  
  
  
  
Great Britain has the less to say in excuse ;  
for this practice, as it is in direct contradiction  
to the principles on which she proceeds in  
other cases. VVhilst she claims and seizes on  
the high seas, her own subject voluntarilyss  
servingsi in American vessels, she has con-&#x27;  
stantly given, when she could giv&#x27;e as a reason  
for not discharging from her service Ameri­  
can citizens that they had volnntarily engaged  
in it. Nay more, whilst she impresses her  
own subjects from the Atncrican service, al­  
though theyssmay have been scttlcd and mar­  
ried and &#x27;even naturalized in the United States,  
she constantly refuses to release from hers,  
American citizcnsis impressed into it, when- ss  
ever she can give for a reason that they were ss  
either settlcd or married within her domini­  
ons. Thus, when the voluntary consent ofss  
the individual savors her pretensions, she ;  
pleads the validity of that consent.—-\Vhen i  
the voluntary consent of the individual stands ss  
in the way of her pretensions, it goes for no- i  
thing! When marriage or residence can be ?  
pleaded in her l&#x27;avor, she avails herself ofthe ss  
plea. XVhen marriage and residence, and e­  
ven naturilization are against her, no respect ss  
whatever is paid to either? She takes by  
force her own subjects voluntarily serving in  
ourvessels. She keeps by some Americanss  
eitizens involuntarily serving in hets. More  
ﬂagrant inconsistencies cannot be imagined. ss  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives  
which ought to be felt by the Btsiizish govern­  
ment to relincptish a practice which exposes it  
to so many reproaches, it is foreseen that ob­  
jections olsidiﬀcrent sorts will be pressed on  
you. You will he told first of the great num­  
ber us British seamcn in the Ameriran trade,  
and of the necessity Of their servit&#x27;es in time of  
war and danger. Secondly, of the right and  
the prejudicc of the British nation with ssre­

Soas, where its domain would he abandoned

sanctuary as that of American vessels for de­  
sertions and traitorous communications to her  
enemies, especially across the char. te to

lst. With respectto the British seemen  
set-ving in our tra-de, it may be remarked  
first. that the number, though considerable.  
is probably less than may be supposed —­  
Secondly, that what is wrongio itself can  
not be made right by connderations of  
expedieocy or advantage. &#x27;shit&#x27;dly, that  
it is proved by the fact, that the number of  
real British subjects gained by the practice  
in question, is of incoosiderablc import­  
ance, even in the scale of advansage. The  
annexed report to congress on the subject

PART II.  
Mr. Mad ison to Mr. Monroe.  
DEPARTMENT of state,  
January 5, 1804.  
Sir,  
The information and observation which  
you have as yet received from me since your  
arrival in London, on tire impressment of  
our seamen and other violations of our rights,  
have been in private letters only. &#x27;J he de­  
lay in making these iujuries the subject of  
official communications, proceeded, first  
from an expectation that the British Govern­  
| ment would have notified formally to the1  
United States as a neutral power, the state  
of war between Great Britain aud France,  
which would have been an apt occasion, for  
combining with assurances of the fairness  
with which our neutral obligations would be  
fulfilled, our just claims on a corre-poudent  
respect for our neutral rights, and particu­  
larly of those which had been least respect­  
ed during the last war: secondly, from the  
expected arrival of Mr. Merry, which, if  
he should not be charged with suclf a notifi­  
cation, might be a favorable opportunity for  
commencing the explanations and discussi­  
ons which must precede a thorough correc­  
tion of the wrongs which we expcVicnce.  
Since the arrival of Mr. Merry, accord­  
ingly, no time has been lost in calling his at­  
tention to the subject; and in preparing both  
it and him, for the negociatiou which is now  
to be committed to you. If appearances  
are to be trusted, his impressions and repre­  
sentations will be friendly to it. In my con­  
versations with him, which have been free  
and tall, he has expressed the best disposi­  
tions, has listened with candor to the ap­  
peals made, as well to the considerations of  
  
ovimi nuuwhwoi uib luuum ,  
and although he suggests serious difficulties  
on certain points, lie will, I believe, sin­  
cerely co-operate in lessening them, and in  
bringing about an arrangement which will  
be accept.iblc to this country. The only to­  
pic on which any thing has passed in wri­  
ting between the department of state and  
him, is that of the pretended blockade ofSt.  
i omingo. Copies of my letter to him and  
ol his answer, arc herewith enclosed ; as  
also of the letter written to Mr. Thornton,  
some time before, and referred to in that to  
Mr. Merry, in relation to a like blockade of  
Martinique and Gaudaloupe.  
Although there are many important ob­  
jects which may be thought to invite conven­  
tional regulations between the United States  
and Great Britain, it is evidently proper to  
leave for subsequent consideration, such as  
are less urgent in their nature, or more dif­  
ficult in their adjustment ; and thereby to  
render the &#x27; way plainer and shorter to an  
agreement with respect to objects which  
cannot be much longer delayed without dan­  
ger to the good understanding between the!  
two nations. With this view the plan of a  
convention contemplated by the president,  
is limited to the cases of impressments of  
our seamen, of blockades, of visiting and  
searching our vessels, of contraband of war,  
and of the trade with hostile colonies, with  
a few other cases affecting our maritime  
rights; embracing however, as inducements  
to Great Britain to do us justice therein, a  
provision for the surrender of deserting sea­  
men and feoldiers, and for the prevention of  
contraband supplies to her enemies.  
The plan digested for your use is sub­  
joined. The first column contains the arti­  
cles which are to be proposed in the first  
instance, and which are considered as with­  
in our just expectations; the second modi­  
fies the. articles into the concessions which  
the British government may possibly require  
and. which it may he expedient for us ulti­  
  
A CONVENTION BETWEEN TUT UNITED  
States and Great Britain.  
FIRST PROPOSAL.  
Article 1. No person whatever shall,  
upon the high seas and without the jurisdic­  
tion r.t either party, be demanded or taken  
out of any ship or vessel belonging to chi  
zens or subjects of one of the parties, by the  
public or private armed ships belonging to  
or in the service of the other, uhless such  
person be at the time in the military service  
of an enemy of such other party.  
SOND AND ULTIMATUM.  
No seaman, seafaring dr other person, shall  
upon the high seas and without the jurisdic­  
tion of either party, he demanded or taken  
out of any ship or vessel belonging to the ci­  
tizens or subjects of one of the parties, by  
the public or private armed ships belonging  
to or in the service of the other party, and  
strict and effectual orders shall be giv en for  
the dupobservance of this engagement: but  
it is to be understood that this article shall  
not exempt any person on hoard the ships of  
e.tlier of the parties, from being taken there­  
from by the cither party, in cased where they  
i may be liab&#x27;e tobc so taken according tothe  
j laws of nation, Which liability, however,  
| shall not be construed to extend in case to  
! seamen or seafaring persons, being actually  
j part of the crew of the v essel in which they  
j m ay be, nor to persons of any description pas­  
! sing from one port to another port of either  
! of the parties.  
An : . II. N o person being a subject or ci­  
&#x27; tizen of one of the parties, and resorting to  
oriesiding in the dominions of the other,  
shall in any case he compelled to serve on  
board any vessel, whether public or private,  
belonging to such other party : and all citi­  
zens or subjects whatever of the respective  
i parties, at this time compulsively serving on  
board the vessels of the other, shall be forth*  
j with liberated, and enabled, by an adequate  
Recompense, to return to their own coun­  
! tpy­  
; Art. III. If the ships of either of the par­  
ties shall he met with sailing either along  
: the coasts or on the high sens, by&#x27; any ship of  
war or other public or private aimed ships  
; of the other party, such ships of war or ©­  
. ther armed vessels* shall, for avoiding all dis­  
I order in visiting and examining the same,  
■ remain out of cannon jliot, unless the state  
  
j of the sea or the place of meeting render a  
I nearer approach necessary ; and shall in no  
case, compel or require such vessel to send  
i her boat, her papers or any person from on  
board, to the belligerent vessel; but the bel­  
ligerent vessel may send her own boat to the  
other, and may enter her to the number of  
two or three men only, who may in an order­  
ly manner, make the necessary inquiries  
concerning the vessel and her cargo ; and  
it is agreed that effectual provisions shall be  
made for punishing violations of any part of  
this article.  
ARTICLE IV.  
Contraband of war shall consist of the fol­  
lowing articles only :salt petre, sulphur, cui­  
rasses, pikes, swords, sword belts, knapsacks,  
saddles and bridles, cannons, mortars, fire­  
arms, pistols, bombs, grenades, bullets, fire  
i locks, flints, matches and gun-powder; ex­  
cepting, however, the quantity of the said  
articles which may be necessary for the de­  
fence or use of the ship and those who com­  
pose the crew ; and no other articles what­  
ever, not here enumerated, shall be reputed  
contraband or liable to confiscation, but shall  
pass freely without being subjected to the  
smallest difficulty, unless they be enemy’s  
property ; and it is to be particularly under­  
stood, that under the denomination of ene­  
my’s property, is not to be comprised the  
merchandize of the growth, produce or ma­  
nufactures of the countries or dominions at  
war, which shall have been acquired by the  
citizens or subjects of the neutral power, Sc  
shall be transported for their account ;  
which merchandize cannot, in any case, or  
Ion any pretext, be excepted from the free­  
dom of the neutral flag.  
ARTICLE V.  
In all cases where the prize courts of ci­  
ther party shall pronounce judgement a­  
, gainst any vessel or property claimed by ci­  
tizens or subjects of the other, the sentence  
or decree shall mention the reasons or mo­  
tives on which the same shall have been  
founded : and an authenticated copy of the  
sentence or decree, and of all the proceed­  
ings in the case, shall, if demanded, be deli­  
vered to the commander or agent of the said  
vessel, without any dela&gt;\ he paying the le­  
gal fees for the same.  
  
AKUCLE VI.  
In order to determine what characterizes  
a blockaded port, that denomination is giv­  
en only to a port where there is by the dis­  
position of the power which attacks it with  
ships stationary, or sufficiently near, an evi­  
dent danger in entering.  
ARTICLE VII.  
[May omit the preamble.}  
In consideration of the distance of the ports  
likely to be blockaded by either party, from  
the ports of the other paity and cf other cir  
cumstances incident to their relative situati­  
ons, it is agreed that no vessel sailing from  
the ports of either, shall, although cleared or  
hound to a blockaded port, be considered as  
violating in any manner the blockade, unless  
on her approach toward such port, she shall  
have been previously warned against enter­  
ing the same.  
ARTICLE VIII.  
May omit “captains, officers.”  
• It is agreed that no refuge or protection  
shall be afforded by either party to the “ cap­  
tains, officers,” mariners, sailors or other  
persons not found to be its own citizens or  
subjects who shall desert from a vessel of the  
other party, of the crew whereof the desert­  
er made a part; but on the contrary, all such  
deserters shall be delivered up, on demand,  
to the commanders of the vessels from which  
they shall have deserted, or to the comman­  
ding officer of the ships of war of thy respec­  
tive nations, or to such other persons as may  
be duly authorised to make requisition in  
that behalf; provided that proof be made,  
within two years from the time of desertion,  
by an exhibition of the ship’s papers, or au­  
thenticated copies thereof; and by satisfac­  
ry evidence of the identity of the person,  
that the deserters so demanded were actu­  
ally part of the crew of the vessels in ques­  
  
And for the move effectual execution of this  
article, adequate provision shall he made for  
causing to be arrested, on the application of  
the respective consuls or vice consuls to the  
competent authorities, all deserters as afore­  
said duly proved to be such, in order that  
they may be sent back to the commadersof  
the vessels to which they belonged, or re­  
moved cut of the country, and all due aid and  
assistance shall be given in searching for, as  
well as in seizing and arresting the said de­  
serters, who shall even be detained and  
kept in the prisons of the countrv at  
the request and cxpcncc of the said con­  
sul or vice-consul, until they shall have  
found an opportunity of sending them or re­  
moving them as aforesaid. Rut if they he not  
I suit back or removed within three months  
from the day of their arrest, they shall he  
set at liberty, and shall not again be arrest­  
ed for the same cause.  
ARTICLE IX.  
May omit “officers or.”  
Tt is further agreed that no refuge or pro­  
tection shall lie affored, by either of the par­  
ties, to any “officers or” soldiers, not found  
to he its own citizens or subjects, who shall  
desert from the military service of the other :  
but that on the contrary, effectual measures  
shall be taken, in like manner and under like  
regulations and conditions, as with respect  
to sailors for apprehending nnv such deser­  
ting soldiers, and delivering them to the  
commanding officers of ?the military posts,  
forts or garrisons, from which they shall have  
deserted, or to the consuls or vice consuls  
on&#x27;either side, or to such persons as may  
he duly authorised to demand their restituti­  
on.  
ARTICLE X.  
[Omitted.]  
It is however understood that no stipulation  
herein made, shall be construed to empower  
the civil or military officers of either of the  
parties, to enter forcibly into any forts, garri­  
sons, posts or other places,or to use violence of  
any sort within t’ r ^uiidiction of the other  
party, or be ion dawn, in any maimer, to  
Contravene tfS derogate from the stipulation  
contained in V first of the abftve articles a*  
gainst dem offing or taking any persons out  
of vessels m the high seas, and without the  
jurisdiction of either of the parties.  
ARTICLE XI.  
Each party will prohibit iu — -  
  
(subjects, from clandestinely carrying away  
from the territories or dominions ol the o­  
ther, any seamen or soldiers belonging to  
such other party.  
ARTICLE XII.  
Neither party shall permit any of the arti­  
cles above enumerated, as contraband of  
war, to be cleared out from its ports to any  
place within the jurisdiction of an enemy of  
; the other party; and, in order to (in force  
, this regulation, due pro*f and security shall  
be given, that all such articles of contra­  
band as may be exported from the ports of  
either of the parties, have been actually des­  
tined elsewhere, than within the jurisdicti­  
on of an enemy of their party.  
ARTICLE XIII.  
Ti his convention shall be in force for the  
term of eight years from the date of the ex­  
change of ratifications. It shall be ratified  
jon both sides within months from  
i the day of its signature, or sooner it’ possi­

On Art-fele 2. The reAs—crsiablencss of this;  
article is manlfcst. Citizens or subjects osonc !  
country resitlitct-g in another, though bound  
by their temporary &#x27;allegiance to many corn­  
mon duties,can never be rightshlly forced in- 7.  
to military service, particularly external ser­  
vice, nor be restrained from leaving their resi­  
(lence when they please. The lztw olsinations  
,pl&#x27;otects them against both, and the violation  
of this law by the avowed impressment of A­  
merican citizcns- residing in Great Britainss  
be pressed with the greater force on the Bri. ss

bound by much stronger ties to the United  
States, as above- explained, as well with the .  
spirit of her commercial laws and policy, by  
which loretgners are invited to a residence.­  
The libel&#x27;qtion of the persons comprehended  
, bythls arttcle, therefore, cannot be justly or  
ss &#x27;honoraﬄy 1&#x27;eshsed, and the provision for their

treaty of 1786 between Great Britain and  
France.  
&#x27;Ihe regnlation is founded in the best rea­  
sons. lst. It is sufficient for the netttral that  
he acqniescesin the interruption of his vo)  
age, and the trouble of the examination, im­  
  
posed by the belligerent commander. &#x27;l 0 ie--&#x27;_  
  
quire a pessitive and activc co-operation on  
his part in hehalf of the latter is more than  
can be justified on any principle. Ld. The  
belltgetcntpai ty can always send more con­  
veniently totl-e neutral vessel, than this can  
send to the helligerent vessel, having neither  
such fit beats for the purpose, especially in a  
tough sea, nor being so abundantly manned.  
Sd. &#x27;I his last et nsideratinn is entorced hy the  
nun. erons and etuel abuses committed in the  
practi e of tet&#x27;uiring the ncutral vessel to send

actually is carried on indircctly between such

not to deprive her enemy of their colonizd

cuitous course into which it 15 forced, an nd­  
vantage to her which if just in itself, would  
not be sufficient to balance the impehttc vexa—  
tions aceruing- to ncutrnl and friendly nations.  
These view-s of the subject have entered  
into my conversations with Mr. lVlei-ry. He  
expresses, lmtwithstundmg, &amp; [elles that C.  
Britain will turn on nnfuvorahle ear to any  
proposition roleylated to give herenemics the  
resources of their eoloniul trade, beyond the  
degree in which her present regnlsict-cttions per­  
mit. This is doubtless to be apprehend-ed, but  
considering the pt&#x27;oposiition as an article which  
may find &amp; h-sidunce in the general barge-in, it  
may not be inudmissihle ; or if inadmissihle  
in the extent proposed, a middle ground may  
perhaps be accepted. The colonial trode 1n  
questiofi&#x27; consists of four branches; first, be­  
tween the colonies and Great Britain herself;  
secondly, between the eolonics and the neu­  
tral con tries carrying on the trode; thirdlctv,  
between the colonies and neutral countries not  
themselves carrying on the trade; fourthly,  
between the colonies and the countries to  
which they belong, or which are parties to the  
war with Great Britain.  
  
ssThe first and second branches are those  
with which her own regulation accord. -The  
last is that to which her avers&#x27;ion will ofcourse  
be. the strongest. Should this aversion be un­  
conquerahle, let it he trierl then, and then on­  
ly, whether on our )ielding, or rather omit­  
ting that point, she will not yield to us in re­

It lS not certain what degree of value Great

it essentially is, with the arsiticle which limits  
the list of contraband. It Will at least miti­  
gate hei Objection to such a limitationct. With  
the range given to contraband by her construe—  
tion of the law of nations, even as acquiesced­  
in by the U. States, a stipulation of this sort  
would be utterly inadmissib&#x27;le.  
The last article, in making this city the  
place for exchanging the ratifications, con­  
sults expedition in putting the treaty into  
operation, since the British ratification can be  
forwarded at the same time with the instru­  
ment itself. . And it is otherwise reasonable,  
that as the negcsiz&#x27;diation and formation of the

OBSERVATIONS  
rCN THE PRECEDING PL Alt»  
CPublished in otir last.J  
The first article relates to impressments  
from American vessels on the high seas. The  
commanders oT British armed vessels have,  
as is well known, been long in this practice.  
They have indeed not only continued it, un­  
der the sanction of their superiors, on the  
high seas; but have, with impunity, extend­  
ed it to our own coasts, to neutral ports and  
to i.eutral territory; and, in some instances,  
to our own havbors. The article docs not  
comprehend these latter cases; because it  
would not be very honorable in Great-Bri­  
tain to stipulate against the practice of such  
enormities-, nor in the United States to rc­  
tur to stipulations as a security against it;  
and because it may be presumed that such  
particular enormities will not be .repeated  
or unpunished, after a general stop shall  
have been put to impressments.  
The article, in its first form, renounces  
the claim to take from the vessels of the  
neutral party, on the high seas, at:y person  
whatever, not in the military service of an  
enemy ; an exception which we admit t&lt;  
come within the law of nations, on the sub­  
ject of contraband of war.  
With this exception, we consider a neu­  
tral flag on the high seas, as a safe guard to  
those sailing under it. Great-Britain, on the  
contrary, asserts a right to search for, anti  
seize her own subjects ; and under that co  
ver, as cannot but happen, arc often seized  
and taken off, citizens of the United State*  
and citizens or subjects of other neutra:  
countries navigating the high seas, under the  
protection of t lie American flag.  
Were the right of Great-Britain in thi&lt;  
case not denied, the abuses flowing from ii  
would justify the United States in claiminv  
and expecting a discontinuance of its exer  
cise. But the right is denied, and on th&lt;  
best grounds.  
  
Although Crreat-nntmn has not yet adopt  
eel, in the same latitude with most other na­  
tions, the immunities of a neutral flag, sh»  
will not deny the general freedom of tht  
high seas, and of neutral vessels navigating  
them, with such exceptions only, as are an  
nexed to it, by the law of nations Sin  
must produce then such an exception in tht  
law of nations, in favor of the right she con  
tends for. But in what written and rcctiv  
ed authority will she find it * In what usage  
except her own, will it he found f Shcwil  
find in both, that a neutral vessel does not pro  
tret certain objects denominated contrabam  
of war, including enemies serving in thi  
war, nor articles going into a bfockadet  
port; nor, as she has maintained, and a  
we have not contested, enemy’s property o  
any kind. But no where will she find an ex  
ception to this freedom of the seas, and o  
neutral flags which justifies the taking awa;  
of any person, not an enemy in military scr  
vice, found on hoard a neutral vessel.  
If treaties, British as well as others, an  
to he consulted on this subject, it will equal  
Ty appear that no countenance to the pine  
tice can he found in them. Whilst they ad  
mit a contraband of war, by enumerating it  
articles, and the effect of a real block id  
*y defining it, in no instance do they affirr  
or imply a right in any sovereign, toer.forc  
his claims to the allegiance of his subject!  
on board neutral vessels, on the high irn  
the contrary, whenever a bellijerei  
  
tlaim against persons on board a neutral ves­  
sel, is referred to in treaties, enemies in mi­  
litary service alone arc excepted from the  
general immunity of persons in that sit­  
uation ; and this exception confirms the  
immunity of *\iose who arc not included in  
it.  
It is not then from the law, or the usage  
of nations, nar from the tenor of treaties,  
that any sanction can be derived for the  
practice in question. And surely it will not  
be pretended, that the sovereignty of any  
nation extends, in any case whatever, be­  
yond its own dominions, and its own ves­  
sels on the high seas. Such a doctrine would  
give just alarm to all nations, and more  
than any thing Would countenance the im­  
putation of aspiring to an uni tersal empire of  
the seas. It would be the less admissible too,  
as it would be applicable to times of peace  
as well aa to times ©f war, artd to property  
as well as to persons. If the law of allcgi  
oner, which is a municipal law, be in force  
at all cn the high seas, on board foreign ves­  
sels, it must be scat all times there, as it is  
Within its acknowledged sphere. Ifthe rea­  
son alleged for it be good in time of war,  
namely, that the sovereign has then a right  
to the service of all his subjects, it must be  
good at all times, because at all times he  
has the same right to their service. War  
is not the only occasion for which he may  
want their services; nor is external danger  
the only danger against which their services  
m:.y be required for his security. Again, if  
the authority el a municipal law can ope­  
rate on persons in foreign vessels «n the high  
seas, because within the dominion of their  
sovereign they would be subject to that law,  
and are violating that law by being in that  
situation ; how reject the inference that the  
authoiity of a municipal law may equally be  
enforced on board foreign vessels on the high  
seas, against articles of property exported  
in violation of such a law, or belonging to  
the country from which it was expo: ted ?—  
And thus every commercial regulation, in  
time of peace too, as well as of war, would  
be made obligatory on foreigners and their  
vessels, not only whilst within the dominion  
of the sovereign tnaking the regulation, but  
in&#x27;every sea, and at every distance where an  
armed vessel might meet with them. Ano­  
i thcr inference deserves attention. If the  
subjects of one sovereign may be taken by  
force from the vessels of another, on the  
high seas, the right of taking them, when  
found, implies the right of searching for  
them ; a vexation of commerce, especially in  
time of peace, which has not yet been at­  
tempted, and which, for that as well as o­  
j thet- reasons, may be regarded as contra­  
l dieting the principle from which it would  
I flow.  
  
Taking reason and justice for the tests of  
this practice, it is peculiarly indefensible ;  
because it deprives the dearest rights of  
persons, of a regular trial, to which the most  
inconsiderable article of property captured  
on the high seas, is entitled ; and leaves  
their destiny to the will of an officer, some­  
times cruel, often ignorant, and generally in­  
terested by his want of mariners, in his own  
decision: Whenever property found in a  
neutral vessel is supposed to be liable on any  
grounds to capture and condemnation, the  
j rule in all cases is, that the question shall  
| not be decided bv the captor, but be carri­  
ed before a legal tribunal, where a regular  
trial may be had, and where the captor  
himself is liable to damages for an abuse of  
his pov/er. Can it be reasonable then or just,  
that a belligerent commander who is thus  
restricted and thus responsible in a case of  
mere property of trivial amount, should be  
permitted, without recurring to any tribunal  
whatever, to examine the crew of a neutral  
vessel, to decide the important question of  
their respective allegiances, and to carry  
that decision into instant execution by forc­  
ing every individual he may choose, into a  
service abhorrent to his feelings; cutting  
him oir from his most tender connections,  
exposing his mind and his person to the  
most humiliating discipline, and his life it­  
self to the greatest dangers ? Keason, jus­  
tice and humanity unite in protesting against  
so extravagant a proceeding. And what is  
the. pretext for it ? It is that the similarity  
of language ahd of features, between Ame­  
rican citizens and British subjects, are such  
as not easily to be distinguished ; and that  
without this arbitrary and summary autho­  
rity to make the distinction, British subjects  
would escape under the name of American  
citizens, from the duty which they owe to  
their sovereign. Is then the difficulty of  
distinguishing a mariner of one country fnom  
the mariner of the other and the importance  
of his services, a good plea foe referring the  
question whether he belongs to one or to the  
■ other, to an arbitrary decision on the Spot,  
by an interested and irresponsible officer ?_  
In all other cases, the difficulty and the im­  
portance of questions arc considered as rea­  
sons for requiring greater care and formali­  
ty in investigating them, and greater secu­  
rity for a right decision on them. To say  
that precautions of this sort are incompati­  
&#x27; Ible with the object, is to admit that the ob­  
1 jjectis unjustifiable, since the only means by  
;! which it can be pursued are such as cannot  
  
DU JUbllllU !•  
&#x27;I he evil takes a deeper die when viewed  
i&#x27;i its practice as well as its principles  
Were it allowable that British subjects should  
/betaken out of American vessels on the  
• i high seas, it might at least be required that  
I the proof of their allegiance should lie or  
■ the British side. This obvious and just rule  
1 is however reversed, and every seaman or  
1 board, though going from an American port  
l and sailing under the American flag, and  
P sometimes even speaking an idiom proving  
f: him not to be a British subject, is presumed  
!to be such, uivless shewn to be an American  
i citizen. It may safely he affirmed that this  
’ | is an outrage and an indignity which has nn  
■ precedent, and which Grcat-Britain would  
i be among the last nations in the world toswf­  
-Ter, if offered to her own subjects and her  
■ &#x27;own flag. Nor is it always against the right  
■ i presumption alone, which is in favor of the  
-; citizenship corresponding with the flag, that  
‘/the violence is committed. Not unfrequent­  
51 ly it takes place in defiance of the most po­  
1 sitive proof, certified in due form by an A­  
? | merican officer. Let it not be said, that ir  
■/ granting to American seamen this protecti­  
*• v*n f°r their rights as such, the point is yiel  
t ded that the p; oof lie» on the Ainei icatvstdo  
f  
  
and that the want of it in the prescribed  
form, justifies the inference, that the&#x27;seaman  
is not of American allegiance. It is distinct­  
ly to be understood, that the certificate usu­  
ally called a protection to American seamen,  
is not meant to protect them under their own  
or even any other neutral flag on Ihe high  
seas. VVe can never admit, that in such a  
situation, any other ^protection is required  
for them than the neutral flag itself, on the  
high seas. The document is given to prove  
their real character, in situations to which  
neither the law of nations nor the laws of  
their own country&#x27; are applicable, in other  
words, to protect them within the jurisdicti­  
on of the British laws, and to secure to them,  
within every other jurisdiction the rights &amp;  
immunities due to them. If in the Course of  
their navigation even on the high seas, the  
document should have the effect of repelling  
wrongs of any sort.it is an incidental advan­  
tage only&#x27;, of which they avail themselves,  
and is by no means to be misconstrued into  
a ri^ht to exact such Jvproof, or to make a­  
ny disadvantageous inference from the want  
of it.  
Were it even admitted that certificates  
for protection might be justly required in  
time of war, from American seamen, they  
could only be required in cases, where the  
lapse of time from its commencement had  
given an opportunity for the American sea­  
men to provide themselves with such a docu­  
ment. Yet it is certain, that in a variety of  
intances, seamen have been impressed from  
American vessels, on the plea, that they had  
not this proof of citizenship, w-hen the dates  
and places of the impressment, demonstra­  
ted the impossibility of their knowing, in  
time to provide the proof, that a state of war  
had rendered it necessary&#x27;.  
Whether, therefore, we consult the law of  
nations, the tenor of treaties or the dictates  
of reason and justice, no warrant, no pretext  
can be found for the British practice of ma­  
king impressment from American vessels on  
the high seas.  
  
Great-Britain has the less to say in excuse  
for this practice, as it is indirect contradic­  
tion to the principles on which she proceeds  
in-other cases. Whilst she claims and sei  
zes on the high seas, her own subjects volun­  
tarily serving in American vessels, she has  
constantly given, when she could give as a  
reason for not discharging from her service,  
American citizens, that they had voluntari­  
ly engaged in it. Nay, more, whilst she im­  
presses her own subjects from the American  
service, although they may have been set­  
tled and married, and even naturalized in the  
U. States, she constantly refuses to release  
from hers, American citizens impressed in­  
to it, whenever she can give for a reason,  
that they were either settled or married  
within her dominions. Thus, when the vo­  
luntary consent of the individual favors her  
pretensions, she pleads the validity of that  
[consent.—When the voluntary consent of  
the individual stands in the wAy of her pre­  
ltcntions, it goes for nothing ! When marri­  
age or residence can be pleaded in her fa­  
vor, she avails herself of the pica. When  
marriage and residence and even naturali­  
zation are against her, no respect whatever  
is paid to either ! She takes by force her  
own subjects voluntarily serving in our ves­  
sels. She keeps by force, American citizens  
involuntarily serving in hers. More flagrant  
inconsistencies cannot be imagined.  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives  
b’hich ought to be felt by the British govern­  
ment to relinquish a practice which exposes  
it to so many reproaches, it is foreseen that  
objections of different Sorts will be pressed  
on you. You will be told, first, of the great  
number of British seamen in the American  
trade, and of the necessity fprtheir services  
in time of war and danger. Secondly, of the  
right and the prejudice of the British nati­  
on with respect to what are called the Bri­  
tish or narrow seas, where its domains would  
be abandoned by the general stipulation re­  
quired. Thirdly, of the use which would be  
made of such a sanctuary as that of Ame­  
rican vessels for desertions and traitorous  
communications to her enemies, especially  
across the channel te Franee.  
  
1st. With respect to the British seamen  
serving in our trade, it may lie remarked,  
first, that the number, though considerable  
is probably less than may be supposed. Se­  
condly, that what is wrong in itself, cannot  
be made right by considerations of expedien­  
cy or advantage. Thirdly, that it is proved  
by the fact, that the number of real British  
subjects gained by the practice in question,  
is of inconsiderable importance, even in the  
scale of advantage. The annexed report tc  
Congress on the subject of impressments,  
with the addition of such cases as may be in  
the hands of Mr. Erving, will verify&#x27;the re­  
mark in its application to the present war  
The statement made by his predecessor du­  
ring the last war, and which is also annexed,  
is in the same view still more conclusive  
1 he statement comprehends not only all the  
applications made by him in the first in­  
stance, for the liberation of impressed sea­  
men, between the month of June, 1797, and  
September 1801, but many also, which had  
been made previous to this agency by Mr  
Pinkney and Mr. King, and which it wasne  
cessavy for him to renew. These applicati­  
ons, therefore, may fairly be considered as  
embracing the greater part of the period  
of the war; and as applications are known  
to be pretty indiscriminately made, thev  
may further be considered as embracing, il  
not the whole, the far greater part of the im­  
pressments, those of British subjects as well  
as others. Vet the result exhibits 2,059 cases  
only, and of tMs number, 102 seamen only  
detained as being British subjects, which is  
! less than l-20th of the number impressed,  
and 1 M 2 discharged or ordered to be so, as  
I not being British subjects, which is more  
than half of the whole number, leaving 805  
for further proof, with the strongest- pre­  
sumption that, the greater part, if not the  
whole, were Americans or other aliens,  
whose proof of Citizenship had been lost or  
j destroyed, or whose situation would account  
for the difficulties and delays in producing  
, it. So that it is certain, that for all the Bri­  
J seamen gained by this violent procced­  
- mg, more than an equal number who were  
not so. wore tfie Victims. It is highly proba­  
; b!e, that for every British seaman so gain­  
ed, a number of others not less than ten for  
r «»er must have been the victims, and it it  
  
even possible that this number may have  
exceeded the proportion of twenty to one.  
It cannot therefore he doubted, that the  
acquisition of British seamen by these im­  
pressments, whatever may be its advantage,  
is lost in the wrong done to Americans, ig­  
norantly or wilfully mistaken for British sub­  
jects ; in the jealousy and ill will excited a­  
j mong all maritime nations by an adherence  
to such a practice ; Sc in the particular pro­  
vocation to measures of redress on the part of  
the United States, not less disagreeable to  
them than embarrassing to Great-Britain, &amp;  
which may threaten the gv&gt;od understanding  
which ought to be faithfully cultivated by  
both. The copy of a bill brought into Con­  
gress under the influence of violations com­  
mitted on our flag, gives force to this latter  
consideration. Whether it will pass into a  
law, and at the present session, is more than  
yet can be said. As there is every reason  
to believe that it has been proposed w ith re­  
luctance, it will probably not he pursued in­  
to effect, if any hope can lie supported, of a  
remedy by an amicable arrangement between  
the two nations. But such is the feeling  
through this country, produced Hy the reite­  
rated and atrocious cases of impressments  
and other insults on our flag, that a remedy  
of some kind will ere long lie called fi r, in a  
tone not to be disregarded. A copy of the  
bill referred to, is herewith inclosed.  
There is a further consideration which  
ought to have weight in this question. Al­  
though the British seamen employed in car­  
rying on American commerce, be in some  
respects lost to their own nation, yet such is  
the intimate and extensive connexion of  
this commerce, direct and circuitous, with  
the commerce, the manufactures, the reve­  
nue and the general resources of the Bri­  
tish nation, that &#x27;mother respects, its mari­  
ners on board American vessels may truly he  
said to be rendering it the most valuable ser­  
vices. It w ould not be extravagant to make  
it a question, whether (J. Britain would not  
suffer more by withdrawing her seamen from  
the merchant vessels of the United States,  
than her enemies would suffer from tlte addi- i  
tion of them to the crews of her ships of war i  
and cruisers.  
  
should any dlihcultv be started ccnccrn­  
ng seamen, born within the British domini­  
ons, and naturalized by the United States,  
since the treaty of 1T83, you may remove it  
by observing, first, that very few if any such  
naturalizations can take place, the law here,  
requiring a preparatory residence of live  
years, with notice of the intention to become  
a citizen entered of record, two years before  
the last necessary formality, besides a regu­  
lar proof of good moral character, conditi­  
ons little likely to be complied with by ordi­  
nary seafaring persons. Secondly, that a dis­  
continuance of impressments on the high  
seas will preclude an actual collision be­  
tween the interfering claims. Within the  
jurisdiction of each nation, and in their res­  
pective vessels on the high seas, each will  
enforce the allegiance which itclaims. Ino­  
ther situations, the individuals doubly claim­  
ed will lie within a jurisdiction innepeudent ol  
both nations.  
2d. The British pretensions to domain over  
the narrow -seas are so obsolete, and so inde­  
fensible, that they never would have occur­  
ed as a probable objection in this case, if they  
hud not actually frustrated an arrangement  
settled by Mr. King with the British minis­  
try, on the subject of impressments from A­  
merican ves^ls on the high seas. A.t the  
moment when the articles were expected to  
be signed, an exception of the “narrow  
seas” was urged and insisted on by lord St.  
Vincent, and being utterly inadmissible on  
our part, the negociation was abandoned.—  
Mr. King seems to be of opinion, however,  
that with more time than was left him for  
the experiment, the objection might have  
been overcome. This is not improbable, if  
the objection Was not merely An expedient  
for evading a relinquishment of a favorite  
practice.  
  
1 tie objection in ljsclt lias certainly not  
the slightest foundation. The time has been  
indeed, when England not only claimed but  
exercised pretensions scarcely inferior to full  
sovereignty over the seas surrounding the  
British Isles, and even as far as Cape rini­  
stereto the south, and Vanstaten in Norway,  
to the north. It was a time however, when  
reason had little sh ire in determining the  
law and the intercourse of nations; when  
power alone decided questions of right; ami  
when the ignorance and want of concert a­  
mong other maritime countncs facilitated  
such an usurpation. The progress of civili­  
zation and information has produced a change  
iri all those respects, and i.&#x27;s principle in the  
code of public law, is at present better esta­  
blished, than the common freedom of the  
seas, beyond a very limited distance from  
the territories washed by them. This dis­  
tance is not indeed fixed with absolute preci­  
sion. It is varied in a small degree by writ­  
ten authorities ; and perhaps it may be rea­  
sonably varied, in some degree, by local pe­  
culiarities. But the greatest distance which  
would now be listened to any where, would  
make a smaH’proportion of the narrowest part  
of the narrowest seas in question.  
What arc in fact the prerogatives claim­  
ed and exercised by Great Britain over these  
seas? If they were really a part of her do­  
main, her authority would he the same there  
as within her other domains. Foreign ves­  
sels would be subject to all the laws and re­  
gulations framed for them, as much as if they  
were within the harbors or rivers of the coun­  
try. Nothing of this sort is pretended —No­  
thing of this sort would be tolerated. The  
only instances in which these seas arc dis­  
tinguished from other seas, or in which Great  
Britain enjoys within them any distinction  
over other nations, arc first, the compliment  
paid by other flags to hers ; secondly, the ex­  
tension of her territorial jursidiction in cer­  
tain cases to the distance of four leagues  
from the coast. The first is a relic of anci­  
ent usurpation, which has thus longest&quot; iped  
the correction, which modern and more en­  
lightened times have applied to other usur­  
pations. The prerogative has been often  
contested however, even at the expence of  
bloody wars, and is still borne with ill will  
and impatience by her neighbors. At the  
last treaty of peace at \tnifens, the aboliti­  
on of it wao repeatedly and strongly pressed b\
France, and it is not improbable that at no  
remote day it will follow the fate.of the title  
of * King of France’ so iongjrorn by the BrW  
  
tish monarchs, and at length So properly sa­  
crificed to the lessons of a magnanimous wis­  
dom. As far as this homage to the British  
flag has any foundation at present, it rests  
merely oil long usage and long acquiescence,  
which are construed, as in a few other cases  
ot maritime claims, into the effect of a gen­  
eral though tacit convention. The second in­  
stance is the extension of the territorial ju­  
risdiction to four leagues from the shore._  
1 his too, as far as the distance may exceed  
that which is generally allowed, rests on a  
l:kc foundation, strengthened perhaps by the  
jot al facility ot smuggling, and the peculiar  
interest which Great Britain lias in prevent­  
ing a practice affecting so deeply her whole  
system ot revenue, commerce and manufac­  
tures, whilst the limitation itself to four  
leagues necessarily implies that, beyond that  
distance no territorial jurisdiction is assum­  
ed.  
But whatever may be the origin or tiic va­  
lue i f these prerogati \ cs m er foreign flag, in  
one case, and within a limbed portion of  
thc-e secs in another, it is obvious that nei­  
tucr ol them will be violated by the exemp­  
tion of Amevean vessels from impressments,  
which are no wise conntced with either  
having neverbeen m ale on flic pretext either  
of withholding the wo ted homage to the  
British flag, or of smuggling in defiance of  
British laws.  
This extension of the British law t&gt; four  
leagues from the shore is inferred from an  
act of parliament p-.ssed in the year 1736,  
{0 (». .. G. oJ) the ti mis of which compre­  
hend all vessels, foreign as Well as British.  
It is possible, however, that the former are  
constructively exccp c 1. Should your en­  
quiries ascertain this to be the -;a e. you will  
1 nd yourself on better ground than the con­  
cession here made  
With respect to Hie compliment paid to  
the British flag, it is als &gt; possible that more  
is here conceded than you may find to be ne­  
cessary. After the peace of 17^3, this com­  
pliment was peremptorily withheld b\ France  
in spite of the remonstrances of G-eat Bri­  
tain ; and it remains for your inquiry, whe­  
ther it did not continue to be refused, not­  
withstanding the failure at Amiens to obtain,  
ficm Gleat Bi.tain a formal renunciation of  
the claim.  
  
I- rom every view of the subject it is reason­  
able to expect, that the exception of the nar­  
row seas, from the stipulation against im­  
pressments, v\ ill not be inflexibly maintained.  
Should it be so, your nr*gociatinn will be at  
an end. The truth is, that so great a pro­  
portion of our trade direct and circuitous  
passes through those channels, and such is  
its peculiar exposure in them *o the wrong  
practised, that with such an exception, anv  
remedy would be very parti £1. And wecaa  
never consent to purchase a partial remedy  
by confirming a general evil, and by subject­  
ing ourselves to our own reproaches, as well  
as to those of other nation&#x27;s.  
3d. It appears as well by a letter from Mr.  
*1 bernton, in answer to one from me, of both,  
[which copies are inclosed, as from conver­  
sations with Mr. Merry, that the facility  
which would he given, particularly’ in the  
British channel, by the immmunity claimed  
tor American vessels, to the escape of trait­  
ors, and the desertion of others whose ser­  
vices in time of war may be particularly im­  
portant to an enemy, forms one of the pleas  
for the British practice of examining Ame­  
rican crews, and wi*l be one of the objections  
to n formal relinquishment of it.  
&#x27;1 his piea, like all others, admits a solid 8c  
satisfactory reply. In the first place, if it  
coidd prevail at all against the neutral claim  
it would authorise the seizure of the persons  
described only, and in vessels bound to a  
hostile country only, whereas tile practice of  
impressing is applied to persons, few if any  
of whom are alledged to he of «*ith»*r descrip­  
uon, and to vessels withersoever bound, even  
to Great Britain herself. In the next place,  
it is not only a preference of a smaller ob­  
;ect on the one sidejto a greatcr obiect on the  
other; but a sacrifice of right on -one side  
to expediency on the other sule.  
  
&#x27;.*‘b» ncvei Uie:cs3, tne possible ad­  
ik i ence ot the Hritish government to this last  
objection, and tile extreme importance to  
our Sea-faring citizens and commerce, of a  
stipulation suppressing a prac &#x27;ce flagrant  
in its nature, and still more so i 1 the abuses  
inseparable from it, youa-e let at liberty  
&#x27;o concur, if necessary, in the mollification  
as it stands in the second column. You will  
observe that this guards, in all cases, tho  
vyews ot oi?r vessel# from being meddled  
\vitH ; and in referring for an exception to  
he immunity on board our&#x27; vessels to the*  
1 iW ofnatiohs. yields no prin iple maintain­  
ed by the U. St ites ; inasmuch as the refer­  
eii( c will be sa&#x27;.isfied by the acknowledged  
exception of e iconics in military service_  
Should persons therefore, other than such be  
taken under pr. text of the law of nations,  
the U. States will be free to Contest the pro­  
ceeding, and there is the less difficulty in lea­  
ving the stipn ation on this footing, as the  
case may nr er happen, and will be pretty  
sure to happen but rarely. You will observe  
also, that in the passage from one port toa­  
nothcr of the respective countries, the ves­  
sels of the neutral parties are to protect all  
persons without exception. Independently  
of the general principle asserted by the IJ.  
States, this respect is due to the peculiar  
character of the coasting tndc, and the ut­  
ter improbability that it will at any time be  
a vehicle to persons of any obnoxious des­  
cription.

done to them.  
On Article 111. This regulation is confor­  
mable to the law of nnti—~s, and to the tenor of  
all treaties which define the belligerent claim  
of visiting and searching neutral vessels. No  
treaty can he cited in which the practice of  
c&lt; nipeliing the neutral-vessel to send its boat,  
its officers, its people or its papers, to the  
belligerent vessel, is authorised. British  
treaties, as well us those to which she is not  
a party, in every instance where a regulati­  
on o: the claim &gt;s undertaken, co-incide with  
the article hen preposed. The article is in  
fact almost a transcript of the article  
of the tve ty of 1786 betweeti Great Britain  
and France.  
1 lie regulation is founded in the hest rea­  
sons. 1st, It is sufficient for the neutral that  
he acquiesces in the interruption of his \o­  
flge, ar.tt the trouble of the examination, im­  
posed by the belligerent commander. To  
require a positive and active co-opevation on  
his part in behalf of the latter, is move than  
can he justified on any principle. 2d The  
belligerent party can always send move con­  
veniently to the neutral vessel, than this can  
send to the belligerent vessel, huvi g neither  
such fit boats for the purpose, cspccialb in a  
rough sea, nor bc’ag so abundantly manned.  
3d. This last consideration i •» enforced by the  
numerous and cruel abuses committed in the  
practice of icquiring the neutr.i vessel to  
send to the belligerent. As an example vou  
will find in the documents now transmitted,  
a case where neither the smallness anil lea­  
kiness of the. boat, nor the boisterous state of  
the weather, nor the pathetic, remonstrances  
of the neutral commander, had auv effect on  
the imperious injunctions of the belligerent,  
and where the task was performed at the  
manifest perii of the boat, the papers, and  
the lives of the people. The limitation of the  
number to be sent on board the neutral ves­  
sel is a reasonable and usuai precaution a­  
gainstthe danger of insults and pillage.  
On Article 1V. This enumeration of con­  
traband articles is copied from the treaty of  
3 781 between Gveat-Britain and Russia_  
It is sufficiently limited, and that veaty is  
an authority more likely than any other to  
be respected bv the British government_

the productions of a hostile colony come- ted  
into neutral property, is takeii fr-m the  
same model, with the addition of the terms  
“ in any case or on any pretext.” This ad­  
dition is meant to embrace more explicitly,  
our right to tr. dc freely with the colonies at  
■war with Great-Britain, and between them  
and all parts of the world, in colonial pro­  
ductions, being at the time not enemy’s, but  
neutral property; a trade equally leg. imafe  
in itself with that between neutral counries  
directly, and in their respective vessels and  
such colonies, which her regulations do not  
contest.  
In support of this right, in opposition t  
the British doctrine, that a trade not H •  
ed by a nation in time of peace, car-.&#x27;  
opened to neutrals in time of w  
be urged, that all nations are in lp »  
tic.e ot varying more or &#x27;.c-&#x27;s in time ot w ...  
their commercial laws, from the state ot  
these laws in time of j eacc ; a pr cf.ce a­  
g-ecable to reason as well us favor . de t  
r.eutral nations ; that the change nt..v be  
made in time of war, on considerations  
not incident to a state of war, bur on such as  
arc known to have the same effect in time  
of peace; that Great-Britain herself is in  
the regulai* practice of changingher naviga­  
tion and commercial laws, in times of war,  
particularly in relation to a neutral inter­  
course with her colonies ; that at this time  
she admits a trade between neutral coun­  
tries and the colonics of her enemies, when  
carried on directly between them, or be­  
tween the former and herself, interrupting  
only a direct trade between such colonies £c  
their parent -state, and between them and  
countries in Europe, other than those  
to which the neutraf trade may respectively  
belong; that as she does not contest the  
right of neutrals to trade with hostile colo­  
nies, within these limitations, the trade can  
be, and actually is carried on indirectly be­  
tween such colonies and all countries, even  
♦hose to which the colonies belong: and,  
consequently, that the effect ot her doctrine  
r.nd her practice, is not to deprive her ene­  
my of their colonial trade, but merely to  
lessen the value of it in proportion to the  
charges incident to the circuitous course in­  
to whicli it is forced, an advantage to her  
which if just in itself, would not be sufficient  
to balance the impolitic vexations accruing to  
neutral and friendly nations.  
  
incsc views ra me suoject nave entered  
into my conversations with Mr. Merry.—  
He expresses, notwithstanding, a belief that  
Great Britain will turn an unfavorable ear to  
any proposition calculated to give her ene­  
mies the res urces &lt;rf their colonial trade, be­  
yond the degree in which her present regu­  
lations permit. This is doubtless to be ap­  
prehended, but considering the proposition  
as an article which may find a balance in  
the general bargain, it may not be inadmis­  
sible, or if inadmissible in the extent pro­  
posed, a middle ground may perhaps be ac­  
cepted. The colonial trade in question con­  
sists of four branches ; first, between the co­  
lonies and Great Britain herself ; secondly,  
between the cob nics and the neutral coun­  
tries carrying on the trade ; thirdly, between  
the colonies and neutral countries not tliem­  
&#x27; reives carrying on the trade ; ’fourtlilv, be­  
tween the colonies and the countries to which  
thev belong, or which arc parties to the war  
with Great Britain.  
The first and second branches arc those  
with which her own regulation , accord. The  
last is that to which her Aversion will of  
cour c be the stongest. Should this aversi­  
on be unconquerable, lot it be tried then,  
and then only, whether on or r yielding, or  
rather omitting that point, she will not yield  
to us in return, the direct trade between hos­  
tile colonies and neutral countries generally.  
You &#x27;*ill be careful, however, so to modi­  
fy the compromise as will mark as little  
as may be, a positive relinquishment of the  
direct trade between the belligerent nations  
and their colonies.  
Should such a compromise be altogether  
rejected, you will limit the article to the  
simple enumeration of contraband, it being  
desirable that without a very valuable con­  
sideration, no precedent should be given br­  
ibe United States of a stipulated acknowledg­  
ment that free ships do not mike free  
g- (*U. And you will om t the -article altoge­  
ther. if a proper list of contraband cannot be  
agreed on, particularly one that excluder  
money, provisioivs and naval stores.  
On si Hide V. This article taken from  
the convention of 1800, between the United  
Stages and France, is Conformable to the  
general practice of the prize courts in the  
la&#x27;- :r, and is the more worthy of adoption  
f very w hurt&#x27;, it would contribute so much  
o tUe consistency and stability of the rule*  
  
of admiralty proceedings. Without a single  
objection justly lying against it. it will have  
tlie important advantages of being a check  
on the inferior tribunals, of enabling, the Su­  
perior tribunal where a faulty reason appears  
&gt;m the face of the sentence, to correct the  
wrong without delay or expense, and of be­  
ing a check moreover on the decision of the  
superior tribunal itself. As prize caus&#x27;es al­  
so arc tried by courts not of a third partv,  
but of one of the parties interested, it is  
but reasonable that the ground should be  
known to the other, on which judgment has  
passed against its citizens or subjects, in or­  
der, if deemed proper, that negotiation may  
be employed for redressing past or guarding  
against future injustice.  
On Article VI. The fictitious blockades  
proclaimed by Great-Britain and made the  
jn-ctext for violating the commerce of neu­  
u-.d nations, has been one of the greatest a­  
• loses ever committed on the high seas._  
During the late war they were carried to  
m extravagance which would have been re­  
dicu ous, if in their effects they had not in­  
fheted such serious and extensive injuries on  
nemrai nations. Ports were proclaimed in a  
&#x27;t&#x27;tv of blockade previous to the arrival of  
;my force at them, were considered in that  
State without regard to intermissions in the  
presence of the blockading force, and the  
proclamations left in operation arter its fi­  
lial departure ; the British cruizers during ■  
the whole time seizing every ves el bourn’  
to such ports, at whatever distance from  
them, and the British prize courts, pro-&#x27;  
uouncing condemnations whenever a know­  
ledge of the proclamation at the time ofsai&gt;­  
ing could be presumed, although It might  
afterwards be known that no real blockade  
existed. The whole scene was a perfect  
mockery, in which fact was sacrificed to  
form , and right to power and plunder. The  
U. Sta.es were amongst the greatest suffer­  
ers ; and would have been still more so, if  
redress for some of the spoliations proceed­  
ing from th.s source, had not fallen within  
the provisions of an article in the treaty of!  
1784. 3 !  
  
From the effects of this and other arbitra­  
ry practices of Grcat-Bi itain, on the temper  
and policy of neutral nations towards her;  
from the spirit of her treaty made near the  
close of the late war with Russia, fr»m ‘lie  
general disposition manifested at rhe begin  
ningof the present towards the United.* tales  
and the comparative moderation observed in  
lvaropc with respect to b chides ; &#x27;if in­  
deed the two cases of tile \\ escr and F.Ibc  
are not to be excepted) it was hoped that  
the mockeries and mischiefs practised under  
■ lie name ol blocitndes would no where b 1  
repeated. It is found, however, that the

measures prove that no general regulations or  
orders have been yet issued by that govern­  
meat against the evil, as might reasonably  
have been expected, and that a stimulated  
security against it, is an object as important  
as it is just.  
  
inc two letters to Mr. 1 homton 8c Mr.  
Merry, the ground is marked out on which  
you will be able to combat the false block­  
ades, and to maintain the definition of a re­  
al one, contained in the proposed article  
which is a literal copy from the 4lh article  
ot the Russian treaty above cited. In addi­  
tion to these letters you find inclosed a let­  
ter of the of to Mr. Pink­  
ney, in which Some views are taken of the  
subject, which may also be of use in your  
discussions with the British government.  
On Article VII.—This article is due, if  
| not to all neutrals, at least to the U. States,  
i who are distinguished by the distance of their  
situation. Decisions of the British court of  
admiralty, have so far respected this peculi­  
arity as to admit a want of information as  
a plea for goi,.g to a blockaded port, where  
such a plea would be refused to less remote  
countries.- But more than this mav fairly lie  
claimed. A vessel, knowing that a particu­  
lar blockade existed two months before, may  
well conjecture that before her arrival at  
the port, which will require two months  
more, the blockade will have ceased ; and  
may accordingly clear and steer for such a i  
pore with an honest intention, in case of fin- j  
ding on her approach, the act otherwise not  
to attempt an unlawful entrance. To con­  
demn vesselsunder such circumstances would  
be manifestly unjust ; ar.d to restrain them  
from a distant voyage to a port once in a  
state of blockade, until information of a  
change shall have travelled a like distance,  
must produce a delay and uncertainty little  
I short of an absolute prohibition of the com­  
merce. To require them even to go out of  
their course, to seek at other ports informa­  
t on on the subject, would be an unreasona­  
ble imposition. The British government can  
have little objection to this article, after de­  
fining blockades as is agreed with Russia, &#x27;  
and as is here proposed ; since our distance f  
i is of itself a security against any concert  
with the blockaded, for surreptitious entries  
which might be attempted by nearer adven­  
turers; and since, in the case of blockades  
by force actually present, a preii ninarv no­  
tice may be required without impairing their  
efficacy, as might be the case with block­  
ades, such as the preceding article guards  
against.  
I lie only difference between the articles  
las standing in the differentcolhmns consists  
in the preamble to that which is tobe admit­  
ted, if the proposition of the other should  
! :&gt;ot succeed. The article is preferable  
without the recital of any reason particular  
to the Dnitcd States, because as a naked sti­  
pulation, it strengthens instead of weakening  
a general principle friendly to neutral and  
pacific nations.  
On ArHelen VIII. IX. and -These  
are articles which are known to have been  
long wished anti contemplated on the part  
of G. Britain, and together with the justice,  
and in many views the expediency toG. Bri­  
tain herself of the articles desired on our  
part, may induce hef to accede to the whole.  
I lie articles are in substance the same with  
a project offered to the American adminis­  
  
tration in the year 1800, by Mr. Liston, who  
appears to have borrowed it from corres­  
ponding stipulations in the convention be­  
tween the United States and France in the  
year The project was at that time  
dropped, owing perhaps, in part to the  
change in the head of the department of  
state, between whom and Mr. Liston it had  
been discussed, and principally, to the diffi­  
culty ot combining with it, proper stipulati­  
ons against British impressments on the high  
seas. Without such an equivalent, the pro­  
ject had little to recommend it to the United  
States, Considered by itself, it was too the  
less admissible, as one of its articles, under  
some obscurity of expression, was thought  
to favor the British pretension to impress  
British seamen from American vessels on  
the high seas*  
A copy of this document is inclosed, as it  
may be not without use, in showing the ideas  
of the British govermneut at that time, so  
far at least as its minister here was an or­  
gan of them.  
The terms in which these articles are to  
be proposed, differ but slightly from those  
in which they may be admitted. In the for­  
mer, the delivery of deserters is confined to  
soldiers and seamen, without requiring a de­  
livery of officers, whose desertion will not  
lie from the service of their country but on  
account of offences for which it might some­  
times be more agreeable to the United States  
to be unbound to give them up for trial and  
punishment. At the same time this conside­  
ration ought not to be a bar to an arrange­  
ment, which, in its general character, will  
be so important to the interests of the Uni­  
ted States.  
  
K/n sirt’Cie AJ. 1 Ins is a stipulation which  
is not to he yielded but in the event of its be­  
ing made an inderspensible condition It  
cannot be essential for the object of it, whilst  
the British government is left free to take  
the precautions allowable within its own ju­  
risdiction for preventing the clandestine de­  
parture of its seamen * r its soldiers, in ncu­  
&gt;i a: els. And it is very ineligible to the  
Unned Mates, inasmuch as it will be difficult  
to e .force the prohibition, whether we re­  
g ird the embarkation of such persons in Bri­  
tish ports, or their landing on the American  
shores; and inasmuch as the inefficacy of  
regulations for such purposes, though made  
with due sincerity and care, may become a  
sourc e of secret jealousy and dissatisfaction,  
it not of controversy and reproach.  
1 he article is copied from that in the ar­  
rangement (of which you have a copy) dis­  
cussed and brought near to a conclusion, be­  
tween Mr. King and tile British ministry, He  
yon are authorised to accede to it, on the  
sup-posh ion tiiat it may again be insisted on.  
it i*- to Ik be recollected, however, that the  
articie was then understood to be the only  
price given icr relinquishing the impress­  
ment of American Sea men. The other oilers  
now ubstiiuted wil: justify you in pressing the  
omission 01 tne original one.  
On „1r,iclc XU. The law of nations does  
not exact of neutral powers the prohibition  
specified in this article. On the other hand,  
it does not restrain them from prohibiting  
a trade, which appears on the face &lt;~i&#x27; the of­  
ficial papers proceeding from the custom  
house t , be intended to violate the law of  
nations and from which legitimate conside­  
ration of prudence may also dissuade a go­  
vernment. All that can be reasonably ex­  
pected by belligerent from neutral powers,  
is that their regulations on this subject be  
impartial, and that their stipulations rela­  
tive to it, when made in time of war at least,  
should not preclude an impartiality.  
It is not certain what degree of value G.  
Britain may put on this article connected as  
it essentially is with the article which limits  
the list of contraband. It will at least miti­  
gate her objections to such a limitation.—  
With the range given to contraband by her  
const rut. tion of the law of nation-, even as  
acquiesced in by the United States, a stipu­  
lation of this sort would be utterly inadmissi­  
ble.  
  
The last article, in making this city the  
place for exchanging the ratifications, con­  
sults expedition in putting the treaty into o­  
peration, since the Hritisii ratification can  
be forwarded at the same time with the in­  
strument itself. And it is otherwise reason­  
ab e, th.-.t as the neg »ciation and formation  
of the treaty will have taken place at the seat  
of he British governmeht, tho concluding  
formality should be at that of the govern­  
ment of the U. States.  
In addition to these Articles which, with  
observations thereon, 1 am charged by the  
president to communicate to you as lus in­  
struction:;, he leaves you at liberty to insert  
any others which may do no more than place  
British armed vessels, with their prizes, on an  
equality within our ports 8c jurisdiction with  
those of France. This would only stipulate  
what would probably be done by gratuitous  
regulations here, 8c us it wouiu nodoubt be ac­  
ceptable to Cireat-britain, it may not only  
aid in reconciling tier to principal objects de­  
sired b the United Stat s, but may induce  
her to concur in the further insertion of ar­  
ticles, corresponding with those in the con­  
vention &lt; f 1 00 with France, which regulate  
more precisely and mere effectually, the  
treatment ot vessels of the neutral party on  
the high seas.  
The occasion will be proper also for call­  
ing tlie attention of the British government  
to the reasonableness of permitting American  
consuls to reside in every part of her domi­  
nions. where, and so long as lie permits our  
citizens to trade. It is not denied .hat she has  
a natural right to refuse such a residence,  
and that she is free by her treaty with us to  
refuse it in other than her European domi­  
nions. But the. exception authorised with  
respect to the residence of cousu seise where,  
having reference to the refusal of our trade  
elsewhere, the refusal of the one ought mani­  
festly to cease with the refusal of the other.—  
When our vessels and citizens are allowed  
to trade to ports in the V\ est Indies, there is  
the same reason for a entemporary admissi­  
on of the consuls to take care of it, as there  
is for their admission in ports whern the  
trade is permanently allowed. There is the  
juster expectation of your success on this  
point, as some official patronage is due to the  
rights of our citizens in the prize courts es­  
tablished in the West India islands. Should  
the British government be unwilling toenter  
into a stipulated provision, you may, perhaps  
obtain an order to the governors for the pur­  
pose. Or if consuls he objected to altogether,  
it is ^desirable that agents may be admitted,  
if no where eise, at least in the islands  
where the vice-admiralty courts are estab­  
lished.  
It has been intimated that the articles as  
standing in the different co&#x27;umns, are to be  
considered, the one as the offer to be made,  
the other as the ultimatum to be required.  
This is however, not to be taken too strict­  
ly ; it being impossible to foresee the turns  
ami the Combination&#x27;* which may present  
themselves in the course of the negotiation.  
The essential objects for the United States  
  
ar« the suppression of impressments, and the  
definition of blockades Next to these in  
importance, are the reduction of the list of  
contraband, apd.the enlargement ot our neu­  
tral trade with hostile colonies. Whilst you  
keep in View therefore, those objects, the  
two last as highly important, and the two  
first as absolutely indispensable, your discre­  
tion in which the president places great con­  
fidence, must guide you in all that re ates  
to the inferior ones.  
With sentiments of great respect Sc es­  
teem,  
1 remain, sir.  
Your most obedient servant,

Depautmknt or State,  
January 5, 1804.  
Sir,—The information and observations  
which you have us yet received from me  
since your arrival in L&#x27; vdon, on the im­  
pressment of our seamen and other violati­  
ons of our rights, have been in private let­  
ters only. The del.i v in making these inju­  
ries the subject of official communications,  
proceeded, first, from an expectation that  
the British government would have notified  
formally to the U. S. as a neutral power,  
the state of war between Great Britain and  
France, which woulu have been .m apt oc­  
casion, for combining with assurances of the  
fairness with which our neutral obligations  
would be fulfilled, our just claims on a cor­  
respondent respect for our neutral rights,  
and particularly of those which had been  
least respected during the las*, war ; second­  
ly, from tiie expected arrival of Mr Mer­  
ry, which, if he should not he charged \vi*h  
such a notification, might he a favorable op­  
portunity fur commencing the explanations  
and discussions wuich must precede a tho­  
rough correction of the wrongs which we  
experience.  
S nee the arrival of Mr Merry, accord­  
ingly, no time has been lost in calling his  
attention to the subject; and in preparing  
both it and him, tor tl.e uegoc ation which  
is now to he committed to you. If appear­  
ances are to be trusted, h:s impressions and  
vepresentati ns will be friendly to it In  
my conversations with him, which have  
been tree and full, he lias expressed the  
lire! #ll^n Qllliino 1...U I;.* — — ...I __I 1  
  
to the appeals made, a« well to the consid I  
erd.ions ot justice, as of the solid interest ofj  
his nation ; and although he suggests «eri- j  
&lt;*tsditliculties on cert tin p ints, tie w !!, 1  
believe, sincerely co-operate in lessening  
them, and in bringing about an arrangc­  
m nt which will be acceptable to this coun­  
try. The only top c on which any thing  
has passed in writing betwien the depart  
snentof state and hint, is that of lie pin ten­  
ded bl .clc.ade oi St. Domingo .Copies of my I  
letter to lum, ant ot bis answer, are here-&#x27;  
with inclosed j as also of tie letter written)  
to Mr. Thornton, some time before, and re­  
ferred to m t latot Mr. Merry, in relation  
to a like blockade of Martinique and Gua­  
daioupe.  
Although there are many important nb.. !  
jects which may be thought to invite eon-(  
ventional regulations between the U. States  
and Gr&#x27;-at Britain, it is evidently proper to!  
leave tor substqu nt consideration, such us  
arc lcssu^ent in their nature, or m in dif­  
ficult in their adjustment ; and thereby to  
render the way plainer and shorter to an  
agree mint with respect to objects which  
cannot be much longer delayed without dan­  
ger to the good understanding between the  
two ntti.iiis. With this view the plan o  
a convention contemplated by the Presi­  
dent, is limited to the cases of impress.,  
ments of our seamen, of blockades, of visi­  
ting ami searching our vessels, of contra­  
hand f!H war and of the trade with hostile  
colonies, with a few other casts uffecting  
our m tritime rights ; embracing however,]  
as inducements to Great Britain to do us  
justice therein, a pr.vision for the surreti- 1  
d^r of deserting seamen and soldiers, and  
for the prevention of contraband supplies 11  
her enemies.  
The plan digested for your use is subjoi­  
ned. fhc first column contains the arti­  
cle! wh eti are to lie proposed in the first  
instance, and which arc onsidered as with­  
in our just * xpcctatinns : the se^ ond nvdi­

the British government m i) possibly rc­

Tlie first article relates to impressment*  
from Ameiican vessels on the h gli seas.  
I h. commandos of British armed vessel;  
have, as is well known, been long in this  
practice 1 hey have indeed not only con  
tinued it, under the sanction of their *u  
p rinrs, on the h gh seas; but have, with  
impunity, cx ended it io our own coasts  
to neutral ports and to neutt al ten i ory ;  
and, in some instances, to our own harbors  
Ihe aittcle does not comprehend th-se  
I; t er cases ; luccuse it would m t be vei j

gi ri&#x27;t the practice of such enormities, nor  
ri the U. States to iccur to st.pulrlions as

« h - &quot;t&#x27;oi ou p aiun 110YC UtCIl put  
to impiessments.  
I lie article, in its fvst form, renounces  
tlie claim to take from he v- s-els of the  
neutral party, oti the high seas, any p, r  
,n whatever, not in the militaiy service  
of an « penny ; a &gt; t xei-pti n which we ad  
mi to c me wi hin ihe law of nations, on  
Hi subject of contraband of war.  
Wi |, this exception, we consider a neu  
iral flag on the high sens, as a sale guaid  
o those sailing uiuiei it. Great Biituin,  
o i the con*ia y, asserts a right :o srarch  
for, and seize her o »n subjects ; and un­  
der that covei, as cannot but happen, are  
o!tm seized and taken off, citizens of the  
United Stales and citizens or subjects of  
other neutral countries navigating the high  
••as, under the protection of the Ameri­  
can flag.  
Were the right of Great-3 bain in this  
ct-.se not denied, the abuses 11 ;wii g from  
.1 would justify the United Stales in claim­  
ng and expecting a discontinuance of its  
exercise. But the light is denied, and on  
the best grounds.  
Alllio* Great Britain has not yet adopt,  
ed, in the seme latitude with most other  
nations, the immunities of a neutral flag,  
she will not deny the general freedom of  
the high seas, and of neutral vessels navi  
gating them, with such exceptions only,  
as are annexed to it, by the law of nations.  
She must produce then such an exception  
in the law of nations, in favor of ihe righ  
she contends for. But in n hat w ri ten aud  
received authority will she find it ? In wh„&lt;  
usage, except her own, w ill i. be f u d ?  
She will find in both, that a tieutiai ve ^el  
does not p ottcl certain objecrh denomina­  
ted contraband of war, including enemies  
serving in the war, ncr articles going nuo  
a bluckadid port; nor, as she has main  
tained, and as we have not contested, rne  
u.y’s property of any knd. Bit no w litre  
will she find an exception to this beedon  
of hi seas, and of neu&#x27;-al fl ,gs which  
jus ifiv s the taking a *ay of any person  
ot an enemy in military nerv.ee, b und on  
bvard a ncu r i! vessel.  
It tti aties, British as well as others are  
o be co&lt; ulted on this subj-c’, it will e­  
  
quc.iy appear that no cnuntenunce to ihe  
l racuce cun be found in them. \Vhil:  
they admit a contraband of war, by eru  
meiatmg its at’iclts, and the effre: of a  
real blockade by defining it, in n ■ instance  
U » they affirm or imply a right in any an  
vereign. o enforce his claims to the a le  
gtanct of his subjects,on board neutral ve* -  
st&#x27;9, on the high seas. On &#x27;he contrary,  
v henever a belligerent claim against per­  
&lt;na on board a neutral vessel, is referred  
in in t eat.es, enemies in military service  
ah. i.c are ©jccep.ed from thegeneial im  
muni y of persons in that situation; and  
this exception confirms the immunity of  
those who are not included in it.  
It is not then from the ■ \w, nr the usage  
r f nations, nor bom the ttnor of treaties  
■hat any sanction can be derived for tht  
practice in question. And surely it wil  
not b» pretended that the sovereignty ol  
ar y nation exier.ds, in any case whatever  
bt-yond its own dominions, and its own ve*.  
sets on the high seas. Such a doctrine  
would give just alarm to ad nations, and  
•nore than any thing wculd countenance  
the imputation of aspiring an universal  
empire of the seas. It would lie the les  
admissible too, as it would be appiicabl  
to limes of peace os well as to times of  
war, and to property a* well os to person .  
If the law of allegiance, which is a muni­  
ciptd law. be in force at all on the high  
s. as, on board foreign vessels, it must be  
s &gt; ui ail times theie, as it is within its ac  
kr owfedged sphere. If the reason ailedg.  
it be good in time of war, namely,  
ihat the s&lt;*vereign has then a tight to ihe  
»ervice of all his subjects, it must be good  
at all tunes, because at all times he ha  
the same right to iheir service. War i.  
not the only occasion for which he may  
want their services; nor is external dan  
ger the only danger against which ihtti  
  
services may be required fur his security.  
Again, if the authority of a municipal law  
car: operate on persons in foreign vessel.  
on ihe high seai, because within ilte tli;.  
minion of their sovereign they would b  
subj ci to ibai law, and are viola i .g that­  
inw by being in that situation ; how reject  
he inference that the audio; ily of a muni  
cipal law may equally be enforced onboard  
r.ircig.i vesNel3 on the high seas, agains  
articles of properly exported in vi&gt; lation  
of such a law, or belonging lothe counity  
from wh&#x27;ch it was exported ? Ami thus li­  
vely commercial regulation, in time ol  
peace too, as well as of war, would be made  
obligato? y m. foreigners and their vessels,  
not only whilst within the dominion of the  
! sovereign making die regulation, but in  
every sea, and at every distance where an  
aimed vessel m ght meet with them A­  
nother inf-rtnee deserves attention* If  
»he subjects oT one sovereign may be ta­  
ken by force from the vessels of an nlier,  
on the high seas, the right of taking &#x27; hem,  
when found, implies the right of seaiching,  
for them, a vexation of commerce, espe­  
cially in time of peace, which has not ye?  
been attempted, and which, for that as well  
as other reasons may be regarded as con­  
tradicting the pi tnciple from which it would  
flow  
Taking reason nnil justice for the tests of  
| this practice, it is peculiarily indefensible ;  
because it deprives the dearest rights of  
persons, of a regular trial, to which the  
t most inconsiderable article of property cap­  
tured on the high seas, is entitled ; and leaves  
tlier destiny to the will of an officer, some­  
times cruel, often ignorant, and generally  
interested by his want of mariners, in his  
own decision. Whenever property f- und  
in a neutral vessel is supposed to be liable  
on any grounds to capture and condemna­  
tion, the rule in all cases is, thac the ques­  
tion shall not lie decided by the captor, but be  
carried before a leeal tribunal. \vhp,-p a  
  
gulartrial may be had, and where the cap­  
tor himself is liable to.damagts for an abuse  
of his power. Can it be reasonable then or  
just, that a beligerent commander who is  
thus restricted and thus responsible in a  
case of more property of trival amount,  
sh- uld be permited, without recurring to a­  
ny ti ibunal whatever, to examine the crew  
of a neutral vessel to decide the important  
question of their respective allegiances,and  
to carry that decision into instant execu­  
tion by forcing every individual he may  
choose, into a service abhor rept to his feel -  
ings; cutting him off from his most tender  
connections, exposing his mihdand his per­  
son to the most humiliating discipline, and  
his life itself to the greatest dangers ? Rea­  
son, justice and humanity unite in protest­  
ing against so extravagant a proceeding.  
And what is the pretext for it ? It is that  
the similiarity of language ancl of features,  
between American citizens and British sub­  
jects, are such as not easily to be distin­  
guished ; and that without this arbitrary  
and summary authority to make the distinc­  
tion, British subjects would escape under  
the name of American citizens, from the  
duty which they owe to their sovereign.  
Is then the difficulty of dis&#x27;inguishing a  
mariner of one country from the mariner  
of the other and the importance of his ser­  
vices, a good plea for refei mg the question  
whether he belongs to one • r*to ihe other, to  
an arbitrary decision on the spot ; by en  
interested and irresponsible officer? In  
all other cast s, he Jiffic.ul y and the im­  
portance of questions re considered as rea­  
sons for requiring greater care and formal­  
ity in invest gating them, and grea er secu­  
rity tor .« right decision on them. To say  
th.it precau ions of this sort are incompati­  
ble with tile object, is to admit that the ob­  
ject is unjust fi .hie, since the only means  
by which ii can be pursued are sucii as can­  
not be justified.  
The evil t .kes a deeper die when viewed  
in its practice as well as its principles.  
Were it ai w bie that British subj cts  
a uhl be tuktn out of American vessels  
on the high seas, it might at least be re­  
quired that the proof of their allegiance  
mould lie on the British » de. &#x27;litis obvi­  
ous and just rule is however reversed, and  
every seaman on board, though going  
from an American port and sailing under  
the Aiqericf.n fl-g, and some times even  
speaking an idiom proving him not to be a  
  
|^rckumcu 10 utr sucii9 un*  
less shewn to he an American citizen. It  
may safely be affirmed that this is an out­  
rage and an indignity which has no prece­  
dent, and which Great Britain would be a­  
inong the lust nations in the world to suf­  
fer d i ffered to her own subjects, and her  
own flag. Nor is it always against the  
right presumption alone, which is in favor  
of the citznsh p corresponding with the flag,  
that the violence is committed, Not uri­  
freqncntly it takes place in deflencc of the  
most positive proof, certified in due form  
by an American officer. Let it not be 3aid  
that in granting to American seamen this  
protection for their rights as such, the point  
is yielded that the proof lies on the Ame­  
rican side, and tha; the want of it in the  
prescribed form justifies the inference that  
the seamen is not of American allegiance.  
It is to hcdistinctly understood, tha1 the cer~  
nficate usual y called a protec ion to Ameri­  
can seamen, is not meant to protect them  
under their own. or even any other neutral  
flag on the h&#x27;gh seas. We can never admit,  
that in such a si nation, any other pro­  
tection is required for them than be neu­  
tral fl«g itself on the high seas. The do  
[cumcnt is gven to prove their real cha­  
racter, in situations to which neither the  
law of nations nor the law of their own coun­  
try are applicable. In other words to pro­  
tec, them within the jurisdiction of the Bri­  
tish laws and to secure to them within every  
otlic (jurisdiction, the rights and immunities  
due to them. If in the course of their naviga­  
tion even on the high seas, the document  
should have the effect of repelling wrong*  
of any sort, it is an incidental advantage  
only of which they avail themsr&#x27;vcs, and  
is by no means to be misconstrued into  
a right to exact such a proof, or to make  
ai.y disadvantageous inference from the  
want o! it.  
Were it even admitted that certificates  
for protection might be justly required in  
time of war from American seamen, they  
could only he required in cases, where the  
laps uf time from its commencement had  
  
;iven an opportunity fur fh*&gt; Ar-*rv-rt  
seamen ro pt..a tie thfcniselves with mu&#x27;  
a document. Yvl it is certain, that in *  
variety of insUmcer., seamen have bit-i. I,,  
pressed .rjm American vzsssc ,, on the „j.. -  
tit at they had no proof of cmienshm, v/;.7.i  
the dates a::d pi.uusof the &#x27;hnpresMUein  
demonstrated the impossibiHy of th,.&#x27;*  
knowing, in time to provide the proof, t(1 V  
a state of war nad rendered it necessary  
Whether, therefore we consult the law  
of nations, the tonor of treaties or the dic­  
tates of reason ,nd justice, no warrant nu­  
pretext can he found lor the British practice  
Ot making impreSimem from American ves­  
sc Is on the high seas.  
Ureal Britain has the less to say in ex­  
cuse lor this practice, as it is in direct  
contradiction to the principles on which e  
proceeds in other cases. Whilst she el ion  
and seizes on the high seas, her own snon ct  
aoluntarily serving in American vessels/sbc  
has consran&gt;ly given when she cr.ulu give  
as a reason for not discharging from hrr  
service Ann rican citizens dial th. &gt;• |, d  
voluntarily engaged in it. N\iy ’ii.nrc  
whilst she imprc-se l her own subjects from  
the American service, although thev may  
have been settled and married anil even  
naturalized in die United States, she con.  
stantly refuses, to release from hers, Amc­  
rican citizens impressed into it whenever she  
can give for a reason that they were either  
settled or married within her dominion*  
Thus, when the voluntary consent of the  
individual favors her pretensions, sho  
pleads the validity of that consent.—When  
the voluntary consent of the individual  
stands in the way of her pretensions, it  
goes for nothing! When marriage or re­  
sidence can be pleaded in her favor, sho  
avails herself of the plea. When mar­  
riage and residence and even naturalization  
are against her, no respect whatever is paid  
to either? She takes by force her own  
subjects voluntarily serving in our vessels.  
She keeps by force American citizens in­  
voluntarily serving in hers. More flagrant  
inconsistencies cannot be imagined.  
  
n.n.vmir,i,umiuS u c poweriui IT10UVCS  
which ought to be felt by the British go­  
vernment to relinquish a practice which  
exposes it to so many reproaches, it is fore­  
seen that objections ot different sorts will  
be pressed on you. You will be told first  
of the great number of British seamen in  
ti.e American trade, and of the necessity  
for their services in time of war and dan­  
ger. Secondly, of the right and the pre­  
judice of the British nation with resqect to  
what are called the British narrow seas,  
where its domain wlioutd be abandoned by  
the general stipulation required. Thirdly,  
of the use which would be made of such a  
sanctuary as that of American vessels for  
desertions and traitorous communications  
to her enemies, especially across the chan­  
nel to France.  
1st- With respect to the British seamen  
serving in our trade, it may be remarked  
first that tile number, though considera­  
ble, is probably less than may be supposed.  
Secondly, that what is wrong in itself can­  
not be made right by consul rations of ex­  
pediency or advantage. Thirdly, that it is  
proved by the fact, that the&#x27;number of  
real British subjects gained by the practice  
in question, is ot inconsideraqle importance,  
even in the scale of advantage. The an­  
nexed report ot Congress on the subject of  
impressments, with the addition of such,  
cases as may be in the hands of Mr&#x27;Fr­  
ying, will verify the remark in its applica­  
tion to the present war. The statement  
made by his predecessor during the last  
war, and which is also annexed, is in the  
same view still more conclusive. The  
statement comprehends not only all the  
applications made by him in the first in­  
stance, for the liberation of impressed sea­  
men between the month of June, 1797,  
and September, 1801, but many also which  
had been made previi us to tins agency by  
Mr Pinckney and Mr King, and which it  
was necessary for him to renew. These  
applications therefore may fairly be consid­  
ered as embracing the greater part of the  
period ot tire war ; and as applications are  
known to he pretty iodise rim imtely made,  
they may further be considered a3 embra­  
[cing, it not the whole, the far greater part  
I of the impressments, those of British »ub­  
Sjects as well as others. Yet the result ex­  
liibits 2.059 cases only, and ol thi-i.umbi r,  
102 seamen only detained as being British  
subjects, which is less than 1-20 of the  
number impressed, and 1142 discharged  
  
or oraet ccl to be so, as not being British  
subjects, which s more than half of the  
whole number, leaving 805 lor further proof,  
with the strongest presumption that the  
greater part, if not the whole, were Amer­  
icans or other aliens, whose proof of citi­  
zens!.;p had been lost rr destroyed, or whose  
situat.on would account for the difficulties  
and delays in producing it. So that it is  
certain, that for all the British seamen,  
gained by this violent proceeding, more  
than an equal number who were not so,  
were the vict.ms. It is highly probable  
that for every Bri.ish seaman so gained,  
a number of others not less than ten lor  
one must have been the victims, and ite­  
ven possible that this number may have  
exceeded the proportion ot twenty to one.  
It ( annot therefore lie doubted, that the  
acquisition of British seamen by these im­  
pvessments, wha ever may be its advan­  
Ingr, is lost in the wrong done to Ameri­  
cans, ignorantly or willuily mistaken for  
British subjects; in the jealousy and ill  
will excited among all maritime lo tions by  
an adherence to such a practice ; and in  
the particular provocation to measures of  
redress on the part of the U. States, not  
less diangreeabh to them than embarrass­  
ing tn\*reat Britain, and which may threat­  
en the go&#x27;Hl understanding which ought to  
be fai hlully cultivated by both. The copy  
of a bill brought into Congress under the  
influence of violations commitid on cur flag,  
gives force the latter consideration. Whe­  
ther it will pass into a law, and at the pi fi­  
sc nt session, is more than yet can be said.  
As there is every reason to hebeve that it  
has been proposed with reluctance, it will  
probably not be pur iued into effect, if any  
hope can be supported, of a remedy by an  
amicable arrangement between the two  
nations. But such is the ieelmg through  
his country produced by tht reiterated  
and a rocinus cases of impressments and  
other insults on our dig. that a remedy of  
some kmd will ore long be called f r in a  
tone not to he disregarded. A copy of the &lt;  
hill referred to is herewith inclosed.

1 here is a further consideration which  
o.ivjht to have weight in this question. Al­  
though the British seamen employed in car­  
rying on American commerce, he in some  
respects Inst to their owr. nation, yet such  
is ;lie intimate and extensive connexion of  
th s commerce, direct n;ul circuitous, with  
the commerce, the manufactures, the reven­  
ue and the general resources of the Brit­  
ish nation, that in other respects, its mar.  
inei s on |v»ard American vessels may tru­  
ly be said to be rendering it the men val­  
uable services. It would not be extrava­  
gant to make it a question, whether G. Bri­  
tain would not suffer more by withdrawing  
her seamen from the merchant vessels of  
the V. SrntcB, than her enemies would suf­  
fer from the addition of them to the crews  
of her ships of war and cruisers.  
Should any difficulty be started concern­  
ing seamen born wi«hin the British domin­  
ions, and naturalized by the U. States since  
the treaty of 1783 you nuiv remove it bv  
observing first, that very few if any such  
naturalizations can take place, the law here  
requiring a preparatory residence of five  
veins, with notice of the intention to be­  
come a citizen entered of record two years  
before the last necessary formality, besides  
u regular proof of good moral character,  
conditions little likely to be complied with  
by ordinary seafaring persons. Secondly,  
that n discontinuance of impressments on  
the high seas will preclude an actual col­  
lision between the interfering claims. With­  
in the jurisdiction of each nation, and in  
their respective vessels on the high seas,  
each will enforce the allegiance which it  
claims. In other s.tuitions, the individu­  
-Sili doubly claimed will be within a juris­  
diction independent of boili nations.  
2d. The British pretensions to domain  
over the narrow seas are so obsolete, and  
so indefensible, that they never would have  
occurred as a probable &lt; Injection in this case,  
if they had not actually frustrated an ar­  
rangement settled by Mr King with the  
British ministry, on the subject of impress  
ments from American vessels on the high  
seas. At the moment when the articles  
were expected to be signed, an exception  
of ie “narrow seas” was urg&#x27;d and in­  
si - e 1 cn by lord St. Vincent, and being ut­  
ter J inadmisible on otir part, the negotia­  
tion was abandoned. Mr King seems to be  
nf itii.ti hnvrAttMr that ttmlt moro tl., &lt;.  
  
than was left him for the experiment, the  
odjcction might have been overcome. This  
is not improbable, if the objection was not  
merely an expedient for evading a relin­  
quishment of a favorite practice.  
The objection in itself has certainly not  
the slightest foundation. The time has  
lien indeed, when England not only claimed  
bu* exercised pretensions scarcely inferior  
to lull sAvercigisty over the seas surrcun”  
ding the British isles, and even as far as  
Cape l&#x27;inistere to the south, ami V.insta  
ten in Norway, to the north. It was a  
time however, when reason had little share  
in. determining the law ami theintercour.se  
of nations ; when power alone decided ques­  
tions of right ; and when the ignorance  
and want of coucet t. among other maritime  
countries facilitated such an usurpation.  
The progress of civilization and informa­  
tion has produced a change in all tho%e ica­  
pects, and no principle in the code of pub­  
lic law, is at present better established,  
than the common freedom of the seas, be­  
yond a very limited distance front the ter­  
ritories washed by them. This distance  
is not indeed fixed with absolute precision.  
It is varied in a small degree by written  
umhoritie ; and pet haps it may be reason­  
ably varied, in some degree, by local pe­  
culiarities But the greatest distance  
which would now be listened to anywhere,  
would make a small proportion ofthenar­  
* fewest part of the narrowest seas in ques­  
tion.  
What are in fact the prerogatives claim.,  
ed and ex? rriseil ,by Great Britain ov r  
these seas ? If they were really a part of  
her domain, her authority would he the  
same there as vvith n her other domains.  
Foreign vessels would be subject to all the  
laws and regulations&#x27;’framed for them, as  
much as ii&#x27;tlitv were within the harb rs or  
rivers of I be country. Nothing of this serf  
is pretended. Nothing ofthiisort would he  
tolerated. The only instances in which  
these sc is are distinguished from other seas,  
or in which G. Britain enjoys within them  
nni distinction over other nations, are first,  
tin compliment paid by oMier lings toilers;  
secondly, the extension of her territorial ju­  
r sdittion in certain Coses to the di tan v  
of four leagues from the roast. The fi.::  
m St 111* j.f nt7&quot;iu.l licit rt 1&#x27;itinn iu K &gt; r lv It t&gt;u  
  
modern and mure enlighten&#x27;d times have  
, applied to other usurpations. The prero­  
gative has been often contested however,  
even at (he expense of bloody wars, and is  
stiil borr.e with ill will and impatience by  
her neighbors. At the lust trc*a»v of pence  
at Amicr.s, the abolition of it was repeat  
■cdly and strongly pressed by France,land it  
is not improbable time at no rciTiot.«* day it  
will follow the fate of the title of 4 King of  
France’ so long worn by the British mon­  
arch&quot; and at length so pmperiy sacrificed to  
iho. &gt;css ns of a magnanimous wisdom. As  
tar .is this homage to the British (lag has  
any foundation at present, if rests merely  
on long usage and long acquiescence^ whicn  
arc construe d, as in a few other cases of ma­  
ririnie claims, in o the effect of a general  
tb&lt; jgh tacit convention. The second in  
stance is the extension of the territorial ju­  
risdiction to four leagues fromfthe shore.  
This »(■ ), as far as the distance may ex­  
r.-c ! that which is generally ullorved, rests  
^ on a like foundation, strengthened perhaps  
by the local facility of rntlUgrrlingj and tKh  
peculiar interest wh&#x27;cli (j. Britain has in  
pi everting a practice effecting so deeply  
her whole system of revenue, commerce  
aud manufactures, whilst the limitation it­  
self to four leagues necessarily impliewihnt,  
beyond that distance no territorial jurisdic­  
tion 13 assumed.  
ilnt whatever may he the orir n or the  
value of these prerogatives ovrr foreign  
flags in ■ nr esse, mid within a limited por­  
Umi of these seas in another, it is obvious  
shat neither of them will be violated by the  
ex. mptmn of American vmsc’.s from im­  
pressments, which are no w.se connected  
with ci lief, having n^ver been made on the

•on.] ;  
The first artirle relates to impressments from A­  
merirun vessels on the high seas. The commanders j  
ot British armed vessels have, as is well known,  
teen long in tms practice. They have indeed not  
•lily continued it, under the sanction of their sope­  
Tiours, on the high sea^ ; hot have, with impunity.  
  
v.Mi&#x27;ilUru u in mil 11 &#x27; 11 ( ikisd, iiruu.n vo «tnu  
to neutral territory ; &lt;*««!, in some instances to otir on n  
iarliors. Thearlicle does not comprehend these lattei  
cases; becaiisoit would not he very honourable in G.  
&#x27;Britain to stipulate against the practice of such e­  
normities, nor in the United States to recur to sti­  
pulations as a security against it ; anti because it  
may he presti ned that such particular enormities  
will not he repe lled or unpunished, alter a genera!  
Itop slot!I have been pul to impressments.  
T&#x27; o article, jn its first form, renounces the claim  
lo taUe from the vessels ot the neutral party, on the  
high seas, my person whatever, not in the military  
service of an cneim ; en exception which we admit  
to come within the I tw of nations, on Ibe su jpet  
of contraband of war.  
With this exception, we consoler a neutral flag  
wn the high seas, as a sale guard to those sailing tin  
der it. Great Britain, on the contrary, asseits a  
right lo search lor, and seize her own subjects ;  
and under that cover, as cannot hut happen, are ol­  
1en seized and talon off, citizens nf the United  
fet.ii.es and citizens or subjects of other neutral  
countries n ivigaling the high seas, tinder the pro­  
tection ot the Xmerican flag.  
Weift the rulit ot Great Britain in this case not  
dennd, the abuses Mowing trom U would justify the  
l:niten Slat-sin claiming and expecting a disconti­  
tiiimce of its exercise. Hut the rights is denied,  
amt n the best grounds.  
Ah hough Great Britain has not yet adopted, in  
the v.ini- latitude with most other nations, the tm­  
Bllin&#x27;t&#x27;es ul a neutral flag, she will not deny the ep­  
noral Ireeriom ot the high seas, and of n&lt; otral ves­  
sels navigating them, with such exceptions only,  
as are annexed to it, by the law of nations, fehc  
jii&#x27;.M produce then such an exception in the law ol i  
n .:nms. in favour ol the right she contends for.—  
lint in what written and rereived authority will she  
find ? In what usage, except her own, will it he I  
found? She will find in both, that a neutral vessel  
does not protect certain objects denominated coutiu­  
li.md of war, including enemies serving in the war,  
nor articles going into a blockaded port ; nor, as  
she has maintained, and as we have not contested,  
enemv’s property ol any kind. But no where will  
she find an exception to this freedom of the sea?, ;  
and of neutral flags which justifies the taking away !  
of anv person, not .in enemy in military service, j  
found on hoard a neutral vessel. j  
If treaties, British as well as others, are fo he  
consulted ori this subject, it will equally appear that  
rip countenance to the practice can be found in them.  
^V.ulsi they admit a contraband of war, f&gt;v enume- !  
idling its articles, and the effect of areal blockade  
bv defining it, in no instance do they affirm or im­  
ply a right in any sovereign, to enforce his claims  
to the allegiance of his subjects, on hoard neutral  
vessels, oh the high sc.ts. On the conliarv, when­  
ever t belligerents claim against persons on hoard a  
neutral vessel, is referred to in treaties, enemies in  
military service alone are exceptel from the general ;  
immunity of persons in that situation ; and this rx- j  
(ppuon confirms the immunity of those who are I  
nat included in it. I  
  
It is not then from the law, nr the usage of nati- ,  
ons, nor from the t-nour of treaties, that any sane  
tinn ran he derived from the practice in question.—  
And surety it will not he pretended that the sove­  
reignty ofanv nation extends, in any rasa whatever, i  
beyond its own dominion&#x27;s, nnd its own vessels on |  
the high seas. Surli a doctrine would give j&gt;r&lt;t a- j  
larni to all nations, and more than any tiling would I  
countfnanre the imputation of aspiring to an u- j  
Iliversal empire of the seas. It would he the i  
lfss udmissihle too, as it would he applicable j  
to times of peace as well as to times of war, ;  
and to property as well as to persons.-If I  
the law of allegiance, which is a municipal law,  
be&#x27;in force at all on the high seas, on boaid foreign j  
vessels, it he so at all times there, as it is within &#x27;  
its acknowledged sphere. If the reason alltdgcii  
for it be good in time of war, namely, that the so­  
vereign bus then a right to the service of all his 1  
subjects, it must ba good at all times, because at1  
all times he has the same right to their service.—E  
War is not the only occasion for which he maye  
want their services ; dor is external danger the on-*  
]y danger against which their services may b&quot; re- 1  
qoir-d for his security. Ag*u&gt;, if the authority olr  
3 municipal law can operate on persons in foreign11  
vessels on the high seas, because within the dorni-r  
nion nf their sovereign they would he subject to that1&#x27;1  
law, and are violating that law by being in that si u  
tuation ; how reject the inference that the million-*  
ty of a mtmicipal law may equally he enforced on1’  
board foreign vessels on the high seas, against arti-n  
cles of pronerty exported in violation of such a law &quot;  
or belonging to the country from which it was ex ’  
ported ? And thus every commercial regulation, in  
time of peace too, as well as of war, would he made  
obligatory on foreigners and their vessels, not onh.  
whilst within the dominion of the sovereign making  
the regulation, but in every sea, and at every in  
Stance where ari armed vessel might meet with  
them. Another inference deserve* attention. Ii  
the subjects of one sovereign may he taken by fore  
from the vessels ef wwther, on the hi^h seas, tb«  
  
&#x27; right &lt;il taking them, when found, implies the right  
ot searching, lur them, a vexation ol commerce,  
especially in time o! peace, which inis not jet been  
attempted, and which, for that as well as other rca­  
som,, may he regarded as contradicting the princi­  
ple irom which it would flow.  
Taking reason and justice for the tests of this  
practice, it is peculiarly indefensible ; because it  
(h prices the dearest rights ot persons, ol a regular  
trial, to which the most inconsiderable article ol  
property raptured on the high sear, is entitled ;  
and leaves their destiny to the will of an ollicer,  
sometimes cruel, often ignorant, and generally in­  
terested by his want ot manners, in his own decisi­  
on. \\ lie never property found in a neutral vpssel  
is supposed to he liable on any grounds to capture  
and condemnation, the rule in all eases is, that the  
question shall not be decided by the raptor, hut be  
carried before a legal tribunal, w here a regular trial  
inuy he had, and whore the captor himself is liable  
to damages for an abuse of his power.  
Call it he reasonable then or just, that a bellige­  
rent commander who is thus restricted and thus re­  
sponsible in a rase of mere properly of trivial a­  
mount, should he permitted, without recurring to  
any tribunal whatever, to examine the crew of a  
neu11ill vessel, to decide the important question ot  
their respective allegiances, and to carry that deci­  
talon into instant ^x^mtion by iornn^ f*vrry indivi­  
dual he may choose, into a service abhorrent to his  
leel Ogs ; i utlmg hnn oil from his most tender con­  
nexion, exposing his mind and his person to the  
most humiliating discipline, and Ins life its&lt; If to the  
greatest dangers? Reason, juslice and humanity  
unite in protesting against so extravagant a pro­  
ceeding.^ And what is the pretext tor it ? It is that  
the similarity ol langna.-e and of features, between  
American citizens and Biitish subjects, are such as  
not easily to he distinguished ; and that w ithout  
this arbitrary and summary authority to make the  
dislim turn, bt itisli subjects would escape under the  
name of American citizens, from the duly which  
thev owe to their sovereign. Is then the difli&lt;-ulty  
0 distinguishing a mariner of one country from the  
mariner ot the other and the importance of his ser­  
vices, a good plea for reterring the question whether  
he belongs to one or to the other, to an arbitrary de­  
cision (&gt;n the spot, by an interested and irresponsi­  
ble oflieer ? In all other cases, the difficulty and the  
importance of questions arc considered as reasons  
for requiring greater care and formality in investi­  
gating them, and greater security for a light derisi­  
on on thrill. Io say that precautions of this sort  
are incompatible with the object, is to admit that  
tne o. jei t is unjustifiable, since the only means by  
whicii it can be pursued .tie such as cannot he jus­  
tified. J  
1 he evil t • k• s a deeper die when viewed in its  
practice as well as Its principles. Were it allowable  
that British subjects should t.e taken out of Arne­  
ro an vessels mi ti.e high seas, it might at least be  
required that the proof of their allegiance should lie  
on the British sid&quot;. Tins obvious and just rule is  
however reversed, and . very seaman on board, tho’  
going from an American port ..nd sailing under the  
American flag, and some times even speaking an  
idiom proving him not to be a British subject, is  
piesumed to lie such, unless shew n to he an Ameri­  
can citizen. It liny saf»Iy he affirmed that this is  
an outrage and an ind gnitv which has no precedent,  
and which Great Britain would be among the last  
nations in the world to stiff, i- ifolTerJl to lu-r own  
subjects, and her own flag. Nor is it always against  
the right ol presumption alone, which is m favour I  
01 the citizenship corresponding with the flag, that ■  
the violence iscomnmterf. Not unfrequenlly it takes |  
place in defiance of the most positive proof, certifi- J  
  
in uuf I&#x27;lnn t»y an American officer. Let u not :  
1 p said that in granting to Aini*riran seam ’r&gt; this I  
protection lor their rijits as snrli, the point is &#x27;  
yielded that the proof iics on the American sole, and  
loot the want of ;t in the prcsrril.ed for nr justifies  
the inferenre that (he seaman is not of American  
allegiaii&quot;Pj It is mstim tlv understood, that the  
rerttlicate usually called a protection to American  
seamen, is not meant to protect them under their  
own, or even any other neiur d (lag on the high seas.  
W e can never admit, that m sfich a situation, any  
other protection is mpured tor them than the neu­  
tl alllag llsell on the high Seas. ’1 lie dormnent IS  
given to prove their real rharacter, in situations  
to which neither the law of nations nor the law of  
their own country are applicable. In other words

knowing, in time to provide the proof, that a stut-r  
of w;ir h«id rendered it necessary.  
Whether, therefore, we consult the law of notions,  
the tenor of treaties or the dictates of reason anil ,  
insure, no warrant, no pretext tail be frtuifcf by the  
Ifrttish practice of making impressment from Ame­  
rican vessels on rl.i high seas.  
Creat-Britain has the less to say in excuse for  
  
this practice*- as it is in direct contradiction tr&gt; the  
principles on which she proceeds i other cases.—  
vV hilst she claims and seizes on the high seas, hei  
own subjects voluntarily serving in American vessels,  
&gt;hc has constantly given, when she could give as a  
icason lor not discharging from her service Ann  
naan eitizfns that they had voluntarily engaged in  
it. Nay more, whilst she impresses her own sub­  
jects Irom the American service, although they  
may have been settled and married and even natura­  
lized in the United Stales, she constantly refuses to  
release troin hers, American citizens impressed in­  
to it whenever she can give tor a reason that they  
were either settled or married within her dominions,  
llius, when the voluntary consent of the individu  
al favours her nretensiioia slip idp^rl.. it... .--.ItU.i.­  
  
u! that consent.—When the voluntary consent ot  
the individual stands in the way ol&#x27; her pretensions,  
it goes lor nothing! When marriage or residi-rue  
ran be pleaded in her favour, she avails heiself of  
the plea. When marriage and residence and even  
naturalization are against her, no respect whatever  
is paid to either! She takes !&gt;v force her own sub­  
jects vtdunle.rily serving in our vessels. • She keeps  
by Imre American citizens involuntarily serving in  
hers. More flagrant inconsistencies cannot be ima­  
gined. *  
Notwithstanding the powerful motives whirh  
ought to bell&#x27;ll by the British government to relin­  
i|uish « practice which exposes it to so many re  
proaches, it is foreseen that objections of different  
sorts will be pressed on von. &#x27; You will lie told first  
ol the great number ot Untish seamen in the Ame­  
rican trade, and ol the necessity for their services  
innmeof w.»i and o..tiger. Secondly, of the light  
and tlie prejudice Ot the British nation- with respect  
to what are called the British or narrow seas, where  
ns dom on would be abandoned by the general sti­  
pulation required. Thirdly, of the u*e which would  
tie made of such a sanctuary ns that of American  
vessels lor desertions and traitorous communica­  
tions to her enemies, especially across the channel  
to France.  
1st. With respect to the British seamen srr&#x27;. ing  
in nor trade, it may be remarked first, that the  
number, though considerable, is probably less than  
may be supposed. Secondly, that what is wrong  
n» itself cannot be made right by cons.d&gt; rations of  
expediency or advantage. Thirdly, that it is prov  
nd by the tact, that the number of real British sub­  
jects gained by the practice in question, is of incon­  
siderable irnpmtanre, even in the scale of advant­  
age. The annexed report to congress on the sub­  
ject of impressments, with the addition of such ra  
scs as may be m the hands of Mr. F.iving, will ve­  
rily tile remark in its application to the present  
war. Tiie statement made by his predecessor dur­  
ing the last war, and which is also annexed, is in  
the same view still more conclusive. The state­  
ment Comprehends not only all thp applications  
made by him in the first instance, for the libera­  
tion ot impressed seamen, betwern the month of  
June, 177, end September, 1801, but many also  
which h id b&quot;tn mane previous to this agency by  
Mr. Pinckney and Mr. King, and which it was ne­  
cebs-iry lor him to renew. These applications there­  
fore may lair&#x27;v be considered as embracing the  
greater part ot the period oi the war; and es appli­  
cations are Known to be prpttv indiscriminately  
made, they may mrther be considered as embracing,  
it ina the whole, the far greater part of the im­  
pressments, those oi British subjects as veil as  
others. Vet tin-&#x27; result exhibkt&#x27;V&#x27;2.050 cases onlv.  
  
arxi «»t thj&lt; nuuihfr, 10‘2 s^aturn o&#x27;finrdplamed as  
being British subjects, which is less than 1-20 of  
the number impressed, and 11-12 discharged nr or­  
dered to be So, as not being British subje.-ts, which  
is more than hah nt tlie whole number, leaving  
^05 lor further proof, with the strongest presump­  
tion that the greater part, if not the whole, were  
Americans or oilier aliens, whose proof of citizen­  
ship had been lust or destroyed, or whose situation  
would account for the rlifliculties and del :js in pro­  
ducing it. So that it is certain, that for all the  
British seamen gained by this violent pioneering,  
more than an cqu.it number who were hot so, were  
the victims. It is highly probable that for every  
British seaman so gained, a number of others not  
less than ten for one must have been the victims,  
and it is even possible that this number may have  
exceeded the proportion of twenty to one.  
It cannot tliereloie be doubted, that the Requisi­  
tion of British seamen by these impressments, what­  
ever may he its advantage, is lost in the wrong done  
in the Americans, ignorantly or wilfully mistaken  
*or British subjects ; in the jealousy and dl will ex­  
cited among all maritime nations by an adherence to  
Wh a practice ; and in the partimlar provocation  
to measuies ot redress on the part of the United  
Slates, not less disagreeable to them than embar­  
rassing to (ireat-Britam, Hnd which may threaten  
,lhe good Understanding which ought to lie faithfully  
cultivated by both. The copy of a hill brought into  
Iroogress under the influence of violations commit­  
ted on otir Hag, gives force to this latter considera­  
tion. Whether it will pass into a law, and at the  
present session, is more than yet ran be said. As”  
there, is every reason to believe that it has been pro­  
posed with reluctanre, it will probably uot be pur­  
sued into effect, if any hope can be supported, of a  
:remedy by an amicable arrangement between the  
two nations. But sorh is the feeling through this  
country, produced by the reiterated and aticvious  
cases of impressments and other insults on our flag,  
that a remedy of some kind will ere long be call.-.I  
*or in a tone not to be disregarded. A copy of thi  
bill referred tn is herewith toelwsed,  
-There is a further consideration whirh ought to  
Iheifc -weight in this question. Although the Bri­  
tish seamen employed in carrying on American  
commerce, be in some Tespects lost to their own  
nation, yet such is the intimate ejUtiuWe  
  
nexion of this commerce, direct&#x27;and cirruitens wit Hi  
ihe commerce, Ihc manufnrtnrese tlic revenue an^  
ho general resources of the British nation, that in.  
other respects, its mariners on board American  
vessels may truly be said to He rendering it th*  
oinst valuable services. It would not be extrava­  
gant to make it a question, whether Great Britain  
would not sutler more hv withdrawing her seamen  
Irom the merchant vessels .of the United States  
than her enemies would suffer from the addition ol‘  
them to the crews ofher ships of war and erui2ers^  
Should any difficulty be started concerning sea­  
m»n born within the British dominions, and natlirai  
lized by the United States sinre the treaty of 1-78-5  
vou may remove it by observing, first, that very  
lew if anv such naliirflli^alinn*. ran il­  
  
law litre requiring a preparatory residence of  
vears, with notice of the intention to become a civ  
tizen entered of record two years before tlie last ne-&#x27;  
cessary formality, besides a regular proof of gnotf  
moral character, conditions little likely tab- com­  
plied with by ordinary sr-a farina persons. Second­  
ly, that a discontinuance of Impressments on that  
high seas will preclude an actual collision between  
the interfering claims. Within the jurisdiction- of  
each nation, and in their respective vessels on th*  
high seas, each will enforce the allegiance which ig  
claims. In other situations, the individuals dou­  
tdv claimed will tie within a justification indepritr  
dent of both nations,- &#x27; &#x27;  
2d.- The British pretensions to maintain over th*  
narrow seas are So obsolete,and so indefensible, that  
i! ev never would have occurred as a probable ob­  
jcction in this rase, if they had not actually frus*  
trated air arrangement setfTcd hv Mr. King with  
the British ministry, on the subject of impress­  
meirtsfrom American vessels on the high seas. Al  
the m&lt;mn nt when the artirles were expected to h«  
signed,, an exception of the “ narrow seas&quot; wsf *  
urged and insisted cm by lord St. Vincent, and be­  
ing utterly inadmissible on our part, the negotiati­  
on was abandoned. Mr. King seems to he of opi­  
mi.ti, however, that with more time than was Tef|  
bun for the experiment, the objection might hav*  
been overcome. This is not improbable, if the ob­  
jection was not merely an expedient for evading*  
relinquishment of a favourite practice.  
The objeciion in itself has certainly rwlthe slight­  
est foundation. The time bus been indeed, when  
Lngl.ind not only claimed but exercised pretensions  
scarcely mieriour to full sovereignty over the seas  
surrounding the British isles, and evfh as far ad  
Cape Fmistere to the south, and Vastaten in Nor­  
way, to (he north. It was a time&#x27;however, when,  
reason had little share in- determining the Taw &amp; (lit  
intercourse of nations; when power alone decided  
questions of right; &amp; when the ignorance and want  
of concert principles among other maritime coun­  
tries facilitated stich an usurpation. The progress,  
of civiliz ation and information has pmdoeed a  
changf in all those respects, and rto principle in th*  
code of publick law, is at present better establish­  
ed, than the Common freedom of the seas, beyond is  
very limited distance from the territories washed  
by them. This distance is hot indeed fixed with ab­  
solute precision. It t« varied in a small degree by  
written authorities ; and perhaps it may be rea­  
sonably varied, in some degree, by local peculiari­  
ties. But the greatest distance w hich would nov*  
be listened to anv where, would make a small pro­  
portion of the narrowest part of the narrowest sea*  
in question.  
  
What are in fart the premg»tivrs claimed and  
e&lt;cef( isrd l.f Ore.it Britain over these seas f If they  
were realty a part of her domain, her authority  
Would he the same there as within her other do­  
mains.&#x27; Foreign vessels would he subject to all tha  
laws and regulations framed for them, as touch  
if they were withiri the harbours or risers of tha  
country, Nothing of tins sort is pretended. No­  
thing of this sort would he tolerated. The only in­  
stances in’ which these seas are distinguished front  
oilier seas, or in which Great Britain enjoys within  
them any distinction over other n-itiohs, are first,  
the compliment&#x27; paid by other flags to hers j se­  
condly, the extension of her territorial jurisdirtioi(  
in certain cases to the distance of four leagues front  
the coast. The first is a relick of ancient usurpa­  
tion, which has thus long escaped the correction,  
which modern and more enlightened times have ap­  
plied to other usurpations. The prerogative has  
been often contested hnwevef, even at the exnenc*  
of bloody wars, and is still home with ill wifi and  
unpatience by her neighbours. At the last treaty  
of peace Ht Amiens, the abolition of it was repeat­  
edly and strongly pressed by France, and it is nof  
improbable that at ho remote day it wifi follow Ibar  
fate of the title of * King of France^ so long won)  
bv the British monarrhs, and at length so properly  
sacrificed to the lessons of a magnanimous wisdom.  
As far as tins homage to *!fce British flag has any  
foundation at present, it rests merely on long usagi  
and long acquiescence, which are construed, as in *  
few other cases of maritime claims, into tire effect  
of i&gt; general though tacit convention. The second  
instance is the extension of the territorial jerisdic­  
tim« to four* leagues from the shore. This too, at  
far as the distance may exceed that which is gene­  
rally allowed, rests on a tike foundation, strengthen­  
ed perhaps by&#x27;the local facility of smuggling, and­  
the peculiar interest which Great Britain has in pree  
venting a practice affecting so deeply her whole sys­  
tem of revenue, commerce and nr mulactures, a*  
gainst the limitation itself to four leagnes necessa­  
rily implies that, beyond that distance no tetritorfr  
ul jurisdiction is assumed.  
But whatever may be the origin or the Valuf df  
these prerogatives over foieign flags hi one rase, amt  
within a limited portion of these seas in another, it  
is obvious that neither of them will be violated by  
the exemption of American vessels from impress­

bnHf Kftr bteu made on tho pretext either of  
withholding the wonted homage to the British flag,  
nr of tauifgling in defiance of British hurt.  
This extension of the British law to four leagues  
from the shore is inferred from an art of parliament  
passed in the year ly 3ti, (9 G. 2 C. 3.j) tlie terms of  
which comprehend all vessels, foreign as wfll as  
, British. It is possible, however, that the former  
•re constructively excepted. • Should y&lt;*ur inquiries  
ascertain this to be the case, you will find yourself  
on better ground than the concession here made.  
With respect to tbecompliment paid to the British  
flag, it is also possible that more is here conceded  
than you may find to be necessary. After the peace  
of 1783, this compliment was peieniplorily with  
held by Fiance, in spite of the remonstrances of G.  
Britain ; and it remains for your inquiry, whether  
it did not continue to he refused, notwithstanding  
the failure at Amiens to obtain from Great Britain  
• formal renunciationof the claim.  
From every ‘view of the subject it is reasonable  
to expect, that the exception of the narrow seas,  
from the stipulation against impressments, will not  
  
oe innexioiy maintained. about 1 it be so, jour  
negotiation will be at an end. The truth is, that so  
great a proportion of our trade direct and circuitous  
Poases through those channels, and such is its  
peculiar exposure in them to the wrong practiced  
that with such an exception, any remedy would he  
very partial. And we ran never consent to purchase  
a partial remedy by confirming a general evil, and  
by subjecting ourselves to our own reproaches, as  
well as to those of other nations.  
3d. It appears as well by a letter from Mr. Thorn­  
ton, in answer to one from me, of both which co­  
pies are inclosed, as from conversations with Air.  
Merry, that the facility which would he given, par­  
ticularly in the British channel, by the immunity  
claimed for American vessels, escape of traitors,  
and the desertion of others whoss services in time  
of war may be particularly important to an enemy,  
forms one of the pleas for tbe British practice of  
examining American crews, and will be one of the  
Objections to a formal relinquishment of it.  
This plea, like all the others, admits a solid &amp; sa­  
tisfactory reply. In the first place, if it could prevail  
at all against the neutral claim, it would authorise  
the seixure of the persons described only, and in  
vessels bound to a hostile country only ; whereas  
the practice of impressing is applied to persons  
few if any of whom are alleged to be either descrip­  
tion, and to vessels wheresoever bound, even to G.  
Biitaiti hefself. In the next place, it is not only a  
preference of a smaller object on one side to a great­  
er object on the other ; hut a sacrifice of right oil  
one side, to expediency on the other side.  
Considering, nevertheless, the possible adherence  
of tbe British government to this last objection,  
and the extreme importance to our sea-faring citi­  
zens and commerce, of a stipulation suppressing a  
practice flagrant in its nature, and still more so in  
the abuses inseparable from it, you are left at liber­  
ty to concur, if necessary, in the modification as it  
stands in the second column. You will observe  
that this guards, in all cases, the crews of our ves­  
sels from heing meddled with; and in referring for  
nn exception to the immunity on board our vessels  
to the law of nations, yields no principle maintnin­  
by the United States ; inasmuch as the relerence  
will be satisfied by the acknowledged exception of  
anemias in military service. Should persons there­  
fore,other than 6uch, he taken under pretext of the  
law of nations, tbe United Stales will he free to  
contest the proceeding, and there is the less difficul­  
ty in leaving tbe stipulation on this footing, as the  
case may never happep, and will he pretty sure to  
happen but rarely. \ ou will observe also, that in  
the passage from one port to another of the respec­  
tive countries, the vessels of the neutral parties are  
to protect all persons without exception. Inde­  
pendently of the general principle asserted by the  
United States, this respect is due to the peculiar  
character of the coasting trade, and the utter impro­  
bability that it will at any time be a vehicle to per­  
sona of any obnoxious description.  
On Article II. The reasonableness of this arti­  
cle is manifest. Citizens or subjects of one country  
residing in another, though bound b&gt; their tempo­  
rary allegiance to many common duties, can never  
be lighithlly forced into military service, particu­  
larly external service, nor be restrained from leav­  
ing their residence when they please. The law of  
nations protects them against both, and the viola­  
tion of this law by the avowed impressment of A­  
merican citizens residing in Great-Brilain, may be  
pressed with the greater force on the British go­  
vernment, as it is in direct inconsistency with her  
impressment of her own subjects hound by much  
stronger ties to the United States, us above explain­  
ed, as well as with the spirit of her commercial  
laws and policy, by which foreigners are invited to  
a residence. The liberation of the persons compre­  
hended by this article, therefore, cannot be justly  
or honourably refused, and the provision for their  
recomprnce and their return home, is equally due  
to tbe service rendered by, and the wrong done to  
them.  
  
vf* u/nuc. asm. i ma rr^uiiuinn is coniormabie to !  
the law of nations, and in the tenor of ail treaties!  
which define the belligerent clnim of visiting and !  
Searching neutral vessels. No treaty can he cited  
in whirh the practice of compelling the neutral vcs*  
•els to send its boat, its officers its people or its pa­  
lters, to the belligerent vessel, is authorized. Bri­  
tish Mealies, as well as those to whirh she is not a  
party, in every instance where a regulation of the  
tlte claim is undertaken, co-itiride with the article  
here proposed. The article is in tart almost a trails­  
script of the article gj the treaty of 1786 between  
Great Britain and France.  
The regulation is founded in the beat reasons.—  
1st. it is sufficient for the neutral that he acquiesces  
in the ipterruptinn of his voyage, and the trouble of  
the examination, imposed by the belligerent com­  
mander. To require a positive and active co-ope  
ration on his part io behalf of the latter, is more  
than ran be justified on any principle. 2d. The  
belligerent parly can always send more convenient­  
ly to the neutral vessel, than this can send to the  
bcllig*rent vessel, having neither such fit boats for  
the purpose, especially in a rough sea, nor being so  
abundantly manned. 3d. This last consideration is  
enforced by the numerous and cruel abuses roramit­  
ted in the practice of requiring the neutral vessel to  
■fiend to the belligerent. As an example you will  
And in the documents now transmitted, a case where  
&#x27;neither the smallness and leakiness of the boat, uoi  
the boisterous stale of the weather, nnr the pathe­  
tick remonstrances of the neutral &lt; ouUUnnder, had  
•ny effect on the imperious injunctions of the beUi.  
v jC/&#x27; nr «  
  
g«rent, and where the task was performed at t)u  
manifest peril oi the boat, the papers, and the’livei  
•if the people. The limitation of the number to b&lt;  
sent mi board the neutral vessel is a reasonable uiic  
usual precaution against the danger (if insults am  
pillage.  
Cbi at tide IV. This enumeration of rontrabanc  
articles is copied from the treaty of 1/81 betweei  
Great Britain and Russia. It is sufficiently limiter  
mid that treaty is an authority more likely that  
.my Other to be respected by the British govern&#x27;  
&quot;•&#x27;‘lit. The sequel of the article, which protects tin  
productions ol a hostile colony converted into neu  
tral property, is taken from the same model, will  
the addition of the terms “ in any case or on an)  
pretext.” This addition is meant to embrace mori  
explicitly, our right to trade freely with the colonies  
at war with Great Britain, and between them anc  
all parts ot the world, in colonial protections, being  
at the tune not enemy s, but neutral property ; t  
trade equally legitimate m itself wllh lbBl belwen  
neutral countries directly, and in their rospectivi  
vessels and such colonies, which her regulations di  
nut contest.  
  
In Hippin t of this light, in opposition to the Bn­  
t:sli doctrine, timt a trade nut allowed by a nation  
in time 01 peace, cannot be opened to neutrals in  
tune of war, it may be urged, that all nations are in  
tin- practice of varying more or less in time of war,  
llieir commercial laws, from the stale of these laws  
in time ot peace ; a practice agreeable to reason as  
well as favourable to neutral nations; that the  
i hange may be made in time of w^r, on considera­  
lions not incident to a stale of war, but on such as  
are known to have the same effect in time of peace ;  
iliat Great Britain herseli is in the regular prartire  
ot changing her navigation and com inti rial laws,  
in time ol war, particularly in relation to a neutral  
intercourse with her rolnnies ; that at this time she  
admits a trade between neutral countries and the co­  
lonies of her enemies, when carried on directly be­  
tween them, or between the former and herself, in­  
terrupting only a direct trade between such colonies  
and their parent state, and between them and coun­  
tries in Europe, other than those to which the neu­  
tral trade may respectively belong; that as she does  
not contest the right of netrals to trade with hostile  
colonics, within these limitations, the trade can be,  
and actually is carried on indirectly between such  
colonies and all countries, even those to which the  
colonies belong ; and, consequently, that the effect  
| of her doctrine and her practice, is not to deprive  
her enemy of their colonial trade, but merely to  
lessen the value of it in proportion to the charges  
incident to the circuitous course into which it is  
mrced, an advantage to her which if just in itself,  
would not be sufficient to balance the impolitick  
vexations accruing to neutral and friendly nations.  
These views of the subject have entered into my  
conversations with Mr, Msrry. HTe expresses,  
notwithstanding, a belief that Great-Britain would  
turn an unfavourable ear to any proposition calcula­  
ted to give her enemies the resources of their colo­  
nial trade, beyond the degree in which her present  
regulations permit. This is doubtless to be appre­  
hended, but considering the proposition as an arti­  
cle which may find a balance in the general bar­  
gain, it may not be inadmissible ; or if inadmissi­  
ble in the extent proposed, a middle ground may  
perhaps be accepted. The colonial trade in ques­  
tion consists of four branches ; first, between the  
colonies and Great Britain herself; secondly, be­  
tween the colonies and the neutral countries carry­  
ing on the trade ; thirdly, between the colonies and  
neutral countries not themselves carrying on the  
trade; fourthly, between the colonies and the  
countries to which they belong, or which me par­  
ties to the war with Great-Britain.  
Tbe first and second branches, are those with  
which her own regulation accord. The last is that  
to which her aversion will of course be the strong­  
est. Should this aversion be unconquerable, let it be  
tried then, and theu only, whether on our yielding,  
or rather omitting that point, she will not yield to  
us in return, the direct trade between hostile colo­  
nies and neutral countries generally. You will be  
careful, however, so to modify tbe compromise as  
will mark as little as may be, a positive relinquish­  
ment of the direct trade between the belligerent na­  
tions and their colonies.  
Should such a compromise be altogether rejected,  
you will limit the article to the simple enumeration  
of contraband, it being desirable that without a ve­  
ry valuable consideration, no precedent should be  
given by the United States of a stipulated acknow­  
ledgment that free ships do not make free goods.  
And you will omit the article altogether, if a pro­  
per list of contraband cannot b* agreed on, parti­  
cularly one that excludes money, provisions and  
naval stores.  
On Article V. This article taken from the con­  
vention of 1800, between the United States and  
France, is conformable to the general prartire of  
prize courts in the latter, and is the more worthy  
of adoption every where, as it would contribute  
ao much to the consistency and stability of the  
rules of admiralty proceedings. Without a sin­  
gle objection justly lying against it, it will have the  
important advantages of being a check on the infe­  
riour tribunals, ol enabling the superiour tribunal  
where a faulty reason appears on the face of the  
sen cnee, to correct the wrong without delay or ex­  
pense, and of being a check moreover on the decU  
sion of the superiour tribunal itself. As prize caus  
es also are tried by courts not of a third party bid  
of one of tbe parties interested, it is but reasonable  
that the ground should be known to the other on  
which judgment has passed against its citizens nr  
subjects, in order, if deemed proper, that negotia­  
tion may be employed for redressiug past or guard­  
ing against future injustice. . L

Letter from Mr. Madia on to Mr. Monroe  
Continued.  
This extension of the British law to four  
longues from the shore is inferred from an  
Fi*,rli:-mem passed in the year 1736,  
(. (t. 2 C. oi) the terms of which compre­  
hend all vessels, foreign as well as British.  
It is possible, however, that the former are  
constructively excepted. Should vour in.  
quines ascertain this to be the co.se, yu  
will find yourself on better ground than the  
concession here made.  
v, -rCSFeCt t*lc compliment paid to  
t.ie British flag, it is also possible that more  
is here conceded than you m -v fin-1 to be ne­  
cessary. Afierthepeacc of 1783 his com­  
pliment was peremptorily withheld bv  
r ranee, in spite of the remonstrances of G&quot;.  
ritain ; and it remains for venr mquin,  
wnerher it did not continue to he refused,  
notwithstanding the failure at Amiens to&#x27;&gt; &gt;­  
am from G. Britain a formal renunciation  
of the claim.  
From every view of the subject it is rea­  
sonable to expect, that tli- exception of t .e  
narrow seas, from die stipulation against  
impressments, will not be inflexibly main,  
tamed. Should it be so, ynur negociation  
will be at an end. The trudi is, that so  
great a proportion of nur trade direct and  
circuitous passes through those channels,  
and such is its peculiar exposure in them  
to die wrong practiced, that with such ■.  
exception, any remedy would be very par­  
tial. Aud we can never consent to pur­  
chase a partial remedy by confirming a ge.  
lrral &#x27;evil, and by subjecting ourselves to  
our own reproaches, as well as to diose of  
other nations.  
J* appears as well by a letter from  
r, 1t‘1Ornt0n’ in HI,&lt;!Wr** to one f.*om me.  
of both wh-ch copies are inclosed, as from  
conversations with Mr. Merry, that the fa­  
cility which would be given, particularly  
in the British channel, by the mimuw  
claimed lor American vessels, to the cs:.i;k  
cl traitoi5y aucithe* *JcH6fti(jn of others \v’io ,•

ly important to an enemy, forms one of tin  
pleas for the British practice of rxamintnv  
Amt i icao crews, amt will he one ot the ob­  
jections to a forma! relinquishment of i  
ihi» plea, liko ail others, admits a solid  
and satisfactory reply. In the first p ic  
u it could prevail at ail against the neu ral  
cla.rn, it wi-pld au horise the seizure of th  
persons described only, and in vesselcb unu  
to a hostile country only ; whereas the pr ,c  
tice of impressing is applie ! to persons t v  
d any of whom are allcttged to be c; euhe  
ocsct iption, and vessels whithcr.soe vt* •  
bound, even to Great Britain herself. I.  
die next place, it is not onlv a preferenci  
ot a smaller object on one side to a grea « r  
object on ^he o-her; but a sacrifice of •  
right on one s dc, to expediency on die o­  
otlier side.  
Considering, nevertlieless, the possible  
adherance of the British government to this  
last objection, and the extreme importu-.;­  
to &lt;&gt;ur st a-f&#x27;aring citizens and r.omm-ice,of  
astipulation suppressing a practice flagrant  
in i s nature, and still more so in the abuses  
inseparable from it, you are left at liberty  
to concur, if necessary, in the modification i  
as it stands in the second column. You will  
observe that this guards, in all cases, the  
crews of our vessels from being meddled 1  
with ; and in referring for an cxcep ion to  
the immunity on board our vessels to the  
law of nations, yields no principle maintai  
n«d by the U. States; inasmuch as the re­  
ference will be satisfied by the acknowled­  
ged exception ot enemies in military ser~  
vice Should persons therefore, otiit r than  
such, be taken under pretext of the law of  
nations, the U S. will be free to contest the  
proceeding, and there is the less difficulty  
in caving the stipulation on this footing, as  
the case may bever happen, and will&#x27;be  
pretty sure to happen but rarely. You will  
observe also, that in the passage from one  
port to another cf the respective countries,  
the vessels of the neutral parties are topro­  
tect all persors without exception. Jnde- j  
pendent ly of theecncral principle asserted  
  
ny the U. this respect is due to the pecu­  
liar character of the coasting trade, and the  
utter improbability that it will at any time  
be a vehicle to persons of any obnoxious  
description.  
On hrticfr If The reasonableness of tills  
article is manifested. Citizens nr subjects  
of onv country residing ,n another, though  
hound by their temporary allegiance to ma­  
ny common du ies. can never be rightfully  
forced into military service, particularly  
external scrvic0, nor be restrained 4rotn  
leaving their residence when they please  
I he law of n tions projects them against  
both, and the violation of this law by the  
avowed impressment of American citizens  
residing in fiveat Britain, may In* pressed  
j with the greater force on the British g &gt;v­  
ernment, ns it is in direct inconsistency  
with her impressment cf her own subjects  
bound by much stronger ties to the U. S.  
as above explained, as well ns with the  
spirit of her commercial Isws and policy,  
by which foreigners are invited to a resi­  
dence. I he liberation of the persons com­  
prehended by this article, therefore, cannot  
bejusth *&gt;r honorably refused, and tin p-o  
vision for the!rrecompence and their return

On jfriiclr III. This regulation is con­  
formable to the law of nation*, and to the  
tenor of all treaties which define the bell!­  
gerent claim ol vs.ting and searching ucu­  
ral vessels No treaty can be r.itcd in which  
the practice of compelling tlr neutral vc*.  
sel to send its boat, its e.Ticers, its prop t  
or its papers, to tbe belligerent vessel, i?  
authorised British treaties, as well as those  
to which she &gt;s not a party, &gt;n every instance  
where »regulation of the claim is undcr.a  
  
ken, coincide with the article here propo  
sed. T lie article is in fict almost a irons  
cript of the art cle of the treaty of 1T8(  
be ween Grest Bri&#x27;ain and Friiice.  
Tile regulation is found&#x27;d in the best rea  
sons. 1st. It is sufficient for the neuira  
that lie ucqu.esces in the nterruption of hi:  
voyage, and the trouble of the examination  
imposed by the belligerent commander. T&lt;  
require a positive and i\C&#x27;.ive co-opcratior  
on ins part in behalf of the latter, is more  
than can be justified on any principle. 2d  
i 1 *,e bel igerent party can always send mort  
conveniently to the neutral vessel, than thii  
can send to the belligerent vessel, having  
neither such fit bontrf lor the purpose, espe^  
ciallv in a rough se*, nor being so abundant*  
lv manned 3a. This last consideration is  
■enforced by the numerous and cruel abuses  
committed in ,he practice of requiring the  
!neutral vessel to send to the belligerent.  
As an example you will find in the docu­  
ments now transmitted, a c.se where nei­  
ther the smallness and lenkint • s of the bon*,  
nor the boisterous state ofthe weather, nor  
&lt;iie pathetic remonstrances of tiie neutral  
commander, hail any effect on the imperi­  
ous injunctions ofthe belligerent, and where  
f it* task was performed at the manifest pe­  
i ii of the boat, the papers, and the lives f  
( people. The limitation of the number  
to be sent on board the. neutral vessel is a  
reasonable and usual precaution ug dost the  
danger of &gt;n«ults nrd pillage.  
On ylriii I V. Tins enumeration of con­  
trail tod articles is copied from the treaty  
V: between Great Britain and Russia.  
I* &#x27;3 sufficiently limited, and that treaty is  
an authority more likely than any other tc  
be respect d by the British government.  
1 he i. quel of the article, which protects  
rhe productions of a hostile colony conver­  
ted it o neutral ^property, is taken from the  
omv model, with the audition of the terms  
,r*. any case or on any pretext.” T .is

ii *d« in tune of war, on considerations noi  
incdent to a state of war, but on such as  
are known to have the same effect in time  
°‘ peace; that Great Britain herseli is in  
the regu nr practice of changing her navi­  
gation and commercial laws, in times of war,  
particularly in relation to a neutral inter­  
coarse with her colonies; that at this time  
she admits a trade between neutral coun­  
tries and the colonies of ner enemies, when  
carried on directly be-ween them, or be­  
tween the former and herself, interrupting  
cn!y a direct trade between such colonic’  
and their parent stare, and between them  
and countries in Europe, other than those  
to which the neutral trade may respectively  
belong ; that as she docs not contest the right  
or neutrals to trade with hostile colonies,  
within these limitations, the trade can be,  
and actually is carried on directly between  
ftucii colonics and all countries, even those  
to which the colonies belong: and, conse­  
quently, that the effect of her doctrine and  
t her pi act ice, is not to deprive her enemv  
!°- their colonial trade, but mere’y to lessen  
the value of it in proportion to the char ge  
incident to the circuitous course into which  
it is forced, an anvatitage to her which it  
just in itself, would not fie sufficient to ba  
lance the impolitic vexations accruing to  
neutral and friendly nations.  
These views of the subject have entered  
■ B to mV Convcrsxtion-J will, . M ,. II.  
  
expresses, notwithstanding, a belief thatG  
Britain wiil turn an unfavorable ear to am  
proposition calculated to give her enemies  
tbe resources of their colonial trade, beyond  
the degree in which h» r present regulati­  
permit. This isdbulnicss to be appre­  
hended, but considering the proposition ns  
an article which may find a balance in the  
general bargain, it may not be inadmissi­  
ble ; or if inadmissible in the extent propo­  
sed, a middle ground may perhaps be ac­  
cepted. The colonial trade in question con­  
sist of four branches; first, between the  
colonies and Great Britain herself ; second­  
ly, between the colonies and the neutral  
countries carrying on the trade; thirdly,  
between the colonies and neutral countries  
no: themselves carrying on the trade ;  
fourthly, between the colonies and the coun­  
tries to which they belong, or which are  
parties to the war with G. Britain.  
The first and r.ccnnd branches are those  
with which herown regulatio s accord&#x27;. The  
iast is (hat to which her aversion will ot  
course be the strongest. Should this aver­  
sion be unconquerable, let It be tried then,  
and then only, whether on our yielding, 01  
rather omitting that point, she will not  
yield to us in return, the direct trade be­  
tween hostile colonies and neutral coun­  
tries generally You will Ire careful, how.  
ever, so to modify the compromise as will  
mark as little as may fic, a positive relin*  
qoishmtnt of the direct trade b&lt; tween the  
!&gt;elligcrcnt nations and their colonies.  
Should such a compromise be altogether  
rejected, juu will limit the article to the  
simple enumeration of contraband, it bcln^

sideration, no precedent should be given bj

i the convention of if*00, be ween f e U. S.  
&gt; and France, is conformably to the general  
practice of the pr ae cunts in the latter,  
and is the more worthy of adoption every­  
where, as it wiuitl contribute so much to  
tiie consistency and stability of the rule*  
of admiralty proceedings. Without a sin­  
gle objection justly lying against it, it -Wilt  
have the important advantages of being

the superior tribunal where a faulty reaSt a  
appears on the face of the sentence, thcor­  
n&lt; t the wrong without delay or expense,  
and of being a check moreover rn the deci­  
sion of the superior tribunal itself. A*  
pr:ze causes also are tried by courts not of

On Jlrtic eil 1 he fictitious blockade*

honest intention, in* case of finding on her  
approach, the fact otherwise, not to attempt  
an unlawful entrance. To condemn ves­  
sels under suah circumstances would he  
re? anile stly uiijus* ; and to restrain them  
from a distant voyage to a port once in a  
state of blockade, until information of a  
change shad have travel!*, d a like distance,  
n*usi produce a delay and uncertainty little  
short of an absolute prohibition of the com­  
merce. To requite them even to go cut  
of their course, to seek at other ports, in­  
formation on the subject, w uld be an un­  
reasonable imposition. The British govern­  
ment can have little odject on to this arti­  
cle, after defining blockades as ts agreed  
with Russia, and us is here proposed ; since  
our distance is of itself a security ag.iirs*  
any concert with the blockaded, for sur­

in the preamble to that which is to be ad

should not succeed The article is prefer

to neutral and pacific rations.  
Onariicc.i, Vlll IX ami X. These arc  
articles which are known to have been  
long wished and contemplated on the part  
of Great Britain and together with the  
justice, and in many views the expediency  
to Great Britain herself of the articles  
desired in cur part, may induce her t&lt;&gt;  
accede to the who&#x27;e. The articles desir  
nn rnr tti v inr]in*r* ta un&#x27;i./**  
  
to the whole. The articles ai e in substam  
the same with a project iffired to th.  
American adniinstra icn in the year 1800,  
by Mr. L;ston, who appears to have boi  
rowed it from ccve.vponiling stipulations in  
the contention between &#x27;.he United States  
und France in tue year The]  
project w .s at that time dropped, owing  
perhaps in part to the change in the head  
of the department of state, between a limn  
and Mr Liston it hail br.en discussed, and  
principally, to the difficulty of combining  
with it, proper stipulations against British  
impressments on the high seas. Without  
such an equivalent, the project had little  
to recommend it to the United States  
Considered by it* elf it was too the les admis­  
sible, as one of i»s articles, under some ob- I  
sanity of expression, was thought to fa tot  
the British pretension to impress British  
seamenfrom Air er can vessels on the high  
seas. t |  
A copy of this document is inclosed, as ]  
it may he not without use, in shewing the  
ideas of yhe British government at that i  
time, so fir at least as its minister here |  
was an organ of them.  
The terms in w hich th&lt;*se articles are o be  
proposed, differ but slightly from those in  
which they may be admitted. In the for  
mer, the delivery of deserters is confined  
to soldiers and seamen, without requiring  
&quot; a delivery of officers, whose deser ion will  
not be from the service of their country,  
but on account of offences for which i  
might sometimes be more agreeable to;he  
United States to be uni ound to give them  
up for trial and punishment. At the same  
lime this consideration ought not to h : a  
bar to an arrangement, which in its gene­  
ral charactt r, will be so important to the  
interests of the United States  
On urtic&#x27;.e XI. This is a stipulation which  
is not to be yielded but in the event of its  
being made an indispensiblc condition. It  
cannot be essential for the object of it, whilst  
the British government is left free to take  
the prccautmns allowable within its own  
jurisdiction h r preventing the clandestine  
departure of its seamen or it soldiers in  
neutral vessels. And it is very ineligible  
to the U Status, inasmuch as it will be dif­  
ficult to enforce the prohibition, whether  
w * regard the embarkation of such persons  
in British ports, or their landing on the  
Americrji shores ; and inasmuch as&#x27;he in­  
cfficacy • f regulations for such purposes,  
»1. ..a~ »1. ,1 ___  
  
may become a source of seer t* jealousy and  
dissatisfaction, if not cf controversy ond  
reproach.  
The article is copied from that in thr  
arrangement (./f which you have a copy)  
discussed and brought near to a conclusion  
between Mr Kir.gand the British ministry,  
and you arc authorised to accede to it, on  
the supposition that it may again he insist­  
ed on. It s to he recollected however, that  
the art cle was then understood to !&gt;e the on­  
ly price given for relinquishing the impress­  
ment of American seamen. The other of­  
fer now substi uted will justify you in pres­  
sing tl.c oinisino of the original one.  
On article XJf. The law of nation#  
dors n&#x27; t ex or of neutral powers the #i o­  
hihitioj specified in this article. On the o  
ther hand, it does not restrain them from  
prohibiting a trade which appears on the  
face of the official papers proceeding from  
the custom house to be intended to violate  
the law of na ions, and from which legiti­  
mate cansiderations of prudence may also  
dissuade a government. All that can be  
reasonably expected by belligerent from  
neu ral powers, is that their regulations on  
this subject be impartial, and that their  
stipulations relative to it, when made in  
time of war at least, should not preclude an &#x27;  
impartiality.  
It is not certain what degree of value  
Great Britain may put on this article, con­  
nected, as] it essentially is, with the ar­  
ticle which limi s the list of contraband  
It will at lei st mitig.ite her objection to  
such a limitation. With the range given 1  
to contraband by her construction of the  
law of nations, even as acquiesced in by the 1  
U States, a stipulation of this sort would he 1  
utterly inadmissible. i  
The last article, in making this city the i  
place for exchanging the ra ifications, eon- 1  
suits expedition in putting the treaty into  
operation, since the British ratification can  
bo forwarded at the. same time with the &lt;  
in trnmont itself. And it is otherwise rea­  
iriistilc, that ns the negotiation ntul forma- |  
tion of the treaty will have taken place &lt;  
at the seat of the British government,  
the co..eluding formality should be at thatj&lt;  
nf he government of Viiu United State*. M  
  
In addition to these articles which, with  
the observations thereon, I am charged by  
the President to communicate to you as his  
instructions, lie leaves you ut liberty to in­  
sert any others which may do more than  
place i&#x27;ldtish armed vessels, with their  
prizes, on an equality within our ports and  
jurisdiction with those of France. This  
would only stipulate what would piobably  
be done by gratuitous regulations here, anil  
as .t would no doubt be acceptable to Great  
Britain, it may not only aid in reconciling  
her to the principal yhjects desired by the  
United States, hut may induce her to con­  
cur in the further insertion of articles, cor­  
I responding with those in the convention of  
■ ICOl) with France, which regulate more  
j precisely and more eflft dually, the treat­  
ment of vessels oi the neutral party on the  
high seas. &#x27;  
The occasion will be proper also, for cnl­  
&#x27;ing the atention oi the British government  
to the rcasonablci ss of permitting Amer­  
ican cenmi s o resple in every part o. her  
d&#x27; minions, where, and so long as she per­  
mits our citizens to trade. 1 is not denied  
that she hss a natural right to refuse such  
a residence, and that she is free by her  
treaty with us, to refuse it in other than her  
1-tiropean dominions. But the exception  
uthcnseil with respect to the residence of  
consuls elsewhere, having reference totht  
rt tusul of our trade elsewhere, the refusal  
ol the one ought manifestly to cesse with  
the refusal of the ether. When our vessels  
and citizens are allowed to trade to ports  
in the W est-Indies, there is the same rea­  
son tor a cotemporary admission of consuls  
to take care oi it, as here is for their ad  
mission in ports where die trade is perma­  
nently allowed. There is the juster expec­  
tation of your -uccess on this point, as some  
official patronage is due to the rigli s of  
c«ur chizci.s in the pr:«7.c courts established  
in the YVtst-Ir.dia islands. Should the  
(mvntMimonf 1 .a am _  
  
!&quot;itoa stipulated provision, you may, per­  
il-ps, obtain nil order tothc governors for  
the purp se. Or if consuls be objected to  
altogether, it is desirable that agents may­  
be admitrd, if no where else, at least in  
the islands where the vice-admiralty courts  
are established.  
It lias been intimated that the articles  
as standing in the a fferent columns, an  
to be considered, »he one as the offer to be  
made, the other as he ultima uin to be  
required. This is however, not to be ta­  
ken too strictly | it being impossible to fore­  
see the turns and the combinations which  
may present themselves in the course of  
tiie negociation. The essential objects lor  
die United Slates are ilie suppression cf  
impressments, and the definitions of block­  
rides. Next to these in importance, are the  
reduction of the list of contiaband, and  
the enlargement of our neutral trade with  
hostile colonies. Whilst you keep in view  
there! re, those objects, the two las a1- high­  
ly imp- rtfsnt, and the two first as absolute­

On article VI. The fictitious blockades pro­  
claimed by Great Britain, and made the pre­  
&quot;xt for violating the commerce of neutral na­  
tions, has been one of the greatest abuses  
ever committed on the high seas. During the  
late war they were carried to an extravagance  
whii h would have been ridiculous, if in their ;  
^ fleets tht y had not inflicted such serious and  
extensive injuries on neutral nations. Ports  
were proclaimed in a state of blockade, previ­  
ous to the arrival of any force at them, were j  
considered in that state without regard to in­  
  
k-j mihiiuub m me presence or tne mocfcadmg  
fort e, and the proclamations left in operation  
after i s final departure, the British cruizers  
onring the whole time seizing every vessel  
f ound to stu h ports,at whatever distance from  
them, and the British prize courts pronounc­  
ing condemnations whenever a knowledge of  
die proclamation at the time of sailing could  
ize presumed, ul&#x27;hough it might afterwards he  
known that no real blotkade existed. The  
whole scene was a.ptrfect mockery, in which  
iact was sacrificed to form, and riglit to pow­  
er and plunder. The United States wire  
amongthe greatest sufferers ; and would have  
been still more so, if redress for some of the  
spoliations proceeding from this source, had  
not fallen within the pro visions of an article in  
the treaty of 1794.  
From the effect of this and other arbitrary  
prat-tires of Great Britain, on the temper  
and policy of neutral nations towards her;  
from the spirit of her treaty made near the  
dose of the late war with Russia, from the  
general disposition manifested at the begin­  
ning of the pi esent towards the United Slates  
uid the comparative moderation observed ir  
Curope, with respect to blockades ; (if in­  
deed the two cases of the Weser and Ribc arc­  
rot to be excepted) it was hoped that the  
mockeries and mischiefs practised under the  
name o- blockades would no where be repeat­  
&lt; 1. It is found, however, that the t\ est In­  
dies are ag.-.tn the theatre of them. The three  
I’ l’iire amt extensive islands of Martinique,  
[ (iiiadaioupe anct St. Jtomiugo have been pul&gt;­  
j f shed as in a state oi bio, kttde, although the  
who.e naval force anpti tl to the purpose is  
i n ousidei able ; u.&#x27;.itough it appears that a  
pai tot this inecnsiviej at/ie ionic- ts occasional­  
ly seen at the distant i oi many leagues at s a ;  
l although it dot s not a| pear that more than one  
i or two putts at must nave at any lime been  
jiu tuaii) biockaued ; i nti although complaints  
| arc heard, that tile L.ritish ships ot war do!  
| not prole, t their own trade, against the nuine- I  
I rous cru.zers from the iou.nds under this pre­  
tended blockade.  
I Inclosed herewith are three letters on this  
| subject; two front me, the first to Mr, 1 hbrn­  
lon, the second to Mr. Merry, and the third  
ir m Mi. Merry to me. You will observe  
that he does not pretend to justify the mea­  
sures pursued in the West Indies ; hut on the  
contrary wishes them to be legarded as pru­  
ceeuing iiom an cm-cr who docs not pursue  
the intentions ol his government. Siiit such  
measures prove that no general regulations or  
orders have been yet issued b) that govern­  
ment against he evn, as might reasonably have  
been e.-p-ceted, ar.u thai a stipulated security  
against it, is an object as important as it is  
I In the two letters to Mr. Thornton and Mr.  
I -Merry, the- ground is marked out on which  
i &gt; ou &quot;&#x27;ll! be aide to com at the taise blockades !  
j and to maintain the definition o* a real one,  
j contained in the proposed artkle of the lius­  
| sian treaty above cited. In addition to these  
j letters, you w ill find inclosed a letter of the I  
to i&#x27;ijr. Pinckneyrin which j  
  
some views are taken ol the subject, which  
I may also be oi use in jour discussions with  
| the Brit.sh government.  
| On orticU 111 I his article is due, if not to  
| all neutrals, at least to the United States, who  
are distinguished by the distance of their situ­  
J aiion. Decisions ol the British courts of ad­  
miralty, have so far respected this peculiarity  
ns to admit a want of information as a plea  
for going to a blockaded port, where such a  
plea would be refused to less remote coun­  
tries. Hut more than this may fairty be claim­  
ed. A vessel, knowing that a particular block­  
ade existed two months before, may well con­  
jecture that before her arrival at the poft,  
which will require two months more, the  
blockade will have ceased; and may accor­  
ding!}- clear and steer for such a port with an  
honest intention, in case of finding on her ap­  
proach, the fact otherwise, not to attempt an  
unlawtul entrance. 1 o condemn vessels un­  
der such circumstances would be manifestlv  
unjust; and to restrain them from a distant  
voy age to a port once in a state of blockade,  
until information of a change shall have tra­  
velled a like distance, must produce a delay  
and uncertainty little short of an absolute pro­  
hibition of the commerce. To require them  
even to go out of their course, to seekat ,o­  
|lh^^poi^;^i^J information bn the subject, would  
\Jl&quot;  
  
he an unreasonable imposition. The British  
government can have little objection to this  
article, after defining blockades as is agreed  
with Russia, and as is- here proposed ; since  
our distance is of itself a security against any  
concert with the blockaded, for serreptitious  
entries, which might be attempted by nearer  
adventurcis; and since in the case of block­  
ades by a force actually present, a preliminary  
notice may be required without impairing their  
ellic acyx as might be the case with block­  
ades, such as the preceding article guards a­  
gatnst.  
1 he only difference between the articles as  
. standing in the different columns, consists in  
the preamble to that which is to he admitted,  
if the proposition ol the other should not suc­  
ceed. 1 he article is preierable without the  
recital oi any reason particular to the United  
States, because as a n .ked stipulation, it  
strengthens instead of njeskening a general  
principle friendly to neutral and paufick na­  
tions.  
  
vuvruaes ruj, IA and A. these are ar­  
ticles tv hi i h are known to have been long wish­  
ed and contemplated on the part of Great Bri­  
tain, and together with the justice, and in  
many views the expediency to Great Britain  
hersell of the articles desired bn her part,  
may induce her to accede to the whole. 1 he  
articles are in substance the same with a pro­  
ject offered to the American administration  
in the year 1800, by Mr. Liston, who appears  
to have borrowed it front corresponding sti­  
pulations in the convention between the Unit­  
ed States and France in the year The  
project was at that time dropped,, owing pei­  
haps in part to the change of the head of the  
department in state, between whom and Mr.  
Liston it had been discussed, and principally,  
to the difficulty of combining w ith it, proper  
stipulations against British impressments on  
the high sea.’. \V ithout such an equivalent,  
the project had little to recommend it to the  
United States. Considered hv itself, it was  
too the less admissible, as one&#x27;of its articles,  
under some obscurity of expression, was  
thought to favour the British pretension#, to  
.impress British, seamen from American ves­  
sels on the high sens.  
A copv oi this document is inclosed, as it  
may be not without use, in shewing the ideas  
ol the British government at that time, so  
lar at least as i.s minister here was an organ  
of them .  
&#x27;I he tet ms in %vhi. h these articles are rd be  
proposed, differ but .slightly from those in  
which they may he admitted. In the former,  
the delivery ol deserters is confined to sol­  
diers and seamen, without requiring a delive­  
ry of offiitr.s, whose desertion will not be  
Ircm the service of their country, but on ac­  
count of offences for which it&#x27;might some­  
times be more agreeable to the United States  
to be unbound to give them up for tt ial end  
punishment. At ihe same time this conside­  
i at ion ought not to De a * ar to an arrangement,  
which, in its general chaiacter, will be so im­  
portant to the interests of the United States.  
On aril le XI. I his is a stipulation which  
is not to he \ ielded in the event of its being  
made an indispensible. condition, it cannot  
be essential for the object of it, whilst the  
British government is left free to take the  
precautions allowable in its own jurisdiction  
for preventing the clandestine departure of its  
seamen or its soldiers in neutral vessels. And  
it is very ineligible to the United States, in­  
asmuch as it will he difficult to enforce the  
prohibition, whether we regard the embarka­  
tion of such persons in British ports, or their  
landing or. the American shores ; and inas­  
much as tiic mellicacy of regulations for such  
purposes, though made with due sincerity and  
care, may become a source of secret jealousy  
and dissatisfaction, if not oj controversy and  
reproach. _  
  
lupicu irum mat in tnc ar­  
rnngcment(of whi-h you have a cop\) dis­  
cussed and brought near to a (onclusion be­  
tween f&#x27;ir. iving and the Dtliish ministry, and  
■ \ou arc authorised to accede to it, on the sup­  
posiuon that it may again be insisted on. It  
into be recollected, however, that the article  
was then understood to be the onlv price giv­  
en for relinquishing the impressment of Ame­  
rican seamen. The other olfer now substitut­  
ed will justify you in pressing the omission of  
th“ original one.  
On urtnle XII The law of nations does  
notexactof neutral powers the prohibition spe­  
cified in this article. On the other hand-it  
does not restrain them from prohibiting trade  
which appears on the face of the oXicial (Su­  
pers proceeding from the custom house to be  
intended to violate the law of nations, and  
from which legitimate considerations of pru­  
dence may also dissuade a government. All  
thatcan be reasonably expected by belligerent  
from’neutral powers, is that their regulations  
on this subject be impartial, and that their sti­  
pulations relative loit, when made in time ot  
war at least, should not preclude an itnpurti­  
^ 1C Jr AT-vOC.-u - • &#x27; itt ^  
; it is not certain yrItat degree .of valise Great  
  
&#x27; Britain may put on this article, connected, a*  
it essentially is, with the article which limit*  
the list of contraband. If will at least raiti- &quot;  
ga»e her objection tOTsurh a limitation,. Will*  
the range given to contraband by hel* construc­  
tion of the law of nations, even as acquiesced  
in by the Unified States, a stipulation1 of’thifr  
sort would be utterly inadmissible.  
The last article,,in making thb,;q$y  
place for exchanging the ratifications, consuUf&#x27;  
expedition In putting the treaty into operati­  
on, since the BH ish ratification ran be for—&#x27;  
wauled at the same time with tlhe instrument  
itself. And it is othc rwise reasonable, that a$ ’ ,j  
the negotiation and-formation of the treaty  
will have taken place at the seat of the ifritish,  
government, the concluding fdrnudfty&#x27; should  
be at that ol the govermueut of the .United  
States. _ __  
  
in nuauion to tuese articles which,/\Vnt* ih$  
observations thereon* I am, charged bir th#  
president to coiTuntinicnte to you as his  
s true lion, lie leaves you at liberty to insert ft*  
ny others which uv v do no more than place  
iiriiisli armed vessels, with their prizes, &lt;ot*  
an equality within our ports and jurisdiction  
with those oi h ranee. ( his would only sti—  
pulntc what would probably be done by;.gratui—  
tous regulations here, and as it would ntf &#x27; y  
doubt be acceptable to Great Britain, it ma/  
not bnly aid in reconciling her to the principal  
objects desired by the United States, i&#x27;ut may i  
induce her to a ncur in the further insertion  
of articles, corresponding with tho^e in thw  
convention ol 1800 with France, which regu­  
late more precisely and more effectually, th&lt;f  
u atrnent of vessels of the neutral party on  
the high seas.  
The ercasion will he proper also, for calling:  
the attention of the Brnish government t® thu  
, reasonableness of permitting American con­  
\ sols to reside in every part of her dominions,  
where, and »o long as shr permits our citizen®  
| to trade. It is not denied that she has a na-»  
j tural tight to refuse such a residence, and that  
j she is it fee by her treaty with us, to refuse it  
in other than her European dominions. But  
the exception authorised with respect to the  
residence ol consuls elsewhere, having refe­  
rence to the refusal ol our trade elsewhere,  
the refusal oi the one ought manifestly tc»  
cease with the refusal of the other. When  
our vessels and citizens are allowed to trades  
, to ports in the West Indies, there is the sama  
reason lor a extemporary admission of consul#  
to take care of it, as there is for their admis- *  
sion in ports where the trade is peimanently  
allowed. There is the juster expectation ©£,*!&#x27;  
your success on this point, as some official pa­  
troin.gfcis due to the rights of our citizens itt g&#x27;  
the p’Ss churls established in the -West India  
istaucts. Should the British government b®  
unwilling to enier into a stipulated provision,  
\ ou mac, perhaps, obtain an oiderto the go- * &#x27;  
vernours li r the purpose. Or if consuls be *  
objected to altogether, it is desirable that a­  
gents may be admitted, if no where else, aff  
least in the islands where the vice-admiralty  
courts are established.  
It has been intimated that the articles a®  
standing in the different columns, are to be  
j considered, the one as the offer to be.made^*  
| the other as tile ultimatum to be required.—  
[ 1 hi* is however, tun to be taken too strictlv f  
| it being impossible to foresee the turns and  
} the combinations which may present them­  
[ selves in the course of the .negotiation. The  
: essential objects lor the United States are th«&quot;  
j suppression of impressments, and the detini­  
i tion ot blockades. Next to these in impor­  
tance, are the reduction of the list of contra­  
band, and the enlargement of ®ur neutral  
trade with &quot;hostile colonies. Whilst you keejr „  
;n view therefore, those objects, the two last  
as highly important, and the two first as abso­  
lutely indispensable, your discretion, in whicK  
the president places great confidence, must  
guide you in all that relates to the irt(eriour &quot;  
ones. ’ 1

The first ankle relates t) impressmenU  
from A merican Vessels on the high seas. The  
commanders of British armed vessels have,  
as is well known, been long in this practice  
They hare indeed not only continued h, un­  
der the sanction of their superiors, on the  
high seas ; but have, with impunity, extend­  
ed it to our own coasts, to neutral pom and  
to neutral territory j ana, In some instances  
  
to our own harbours. The article does not  
comprehend these latter casts because It  
would not be very honorable in G. Britain  
to stipulate against the practice of such enor  
mitics, nor in tbeUnitrd States to recur to  
stipulations as a security a-aitist it ; and be­  
came it may be presumed that such particu­  
lar enormities wdl not be repeated or unpun­  
ished, after a general stop shaU have tees put  
to impressments. K. v.&quot;&#x27;,1 ,f &quot; -v  
: The article, in iu first furmj renounces the  
claim to lake from the vessels cf the neutral  
party, on the high seas, any person whatever  
act in the military service of aa enemy ( an  
exception which we .admit to come within  
the law of nations, on the suljcctcX contra­  
band of war, - r-i y 11&#x27; , : &#x27;  
- With this exception, we consider a neutral  
Bag on the high seas, asa satv guard to those  
sailing under Great Briuin. on the con­  
trary, asserts a right to search lor, and seize  
her own subjects j and under that cover, as&#x27;  
cannot but happen, are often seized and ta­  
ken ofT, citlaens cf the United States and citi­  
sens or subjects of other neutral cutmtrics na­  
vigating the high seas, under the protection  
of the American flag.  
Were the right cf Great Britain In this  
case not &quot;denied, the abuses flowing from it  
would justify the United States In claiming  
and expecting a dwcoiiUnuanre of Its exer­  
cise. But the rights is denied, and on the  
-best gmmds.:I:i.i....::. :C-.ui,ijiliX--  
Although Great Britain has not yet adopt­  
ed, m the same latitude with most other na­  
tions, the imrounltes of a neutral &#x27;flag, she  
win not deny the general freedom of the high  
seas, and of neutral vessels navigating them,  
with such exceptions only , &quot;as are annexed to  
It by the law of nations. She must produce  
then such an exception in the law of nations,  
in favour of the rir&#x27;it she contends for. But  
  
1 in what .written and received authority  
  
will she find it t In what usage, except her  
own, Will it be found t She will find in both,  
That a neutral vessel docs riot piect certain  
ojects denomioated contraband of war, ia-  
  
ciu&#x27;iing enemies serving m the wr , nor ar  
  
tictef f oLtg-inw T;blockldedmiTTof ir  
she has maintained, and as we have not con­  
tested, enemy&#x27;s&quot; property of any kind. But,  
no where will she frnd an exception to this  
freedom of the seas, and of neutral flags which  
justifies the taking away of any person, not  
an enemy In military service, found on board  
a neutral vessel. .- -.. &#x27;. v &quot;  
If treatiesBritisli &quot;as well as others are to  
be consulted on this sijecCSTflf  
sppr-ir that no unintenance to the practice  
can be found In them. WhiHrthey admit a  
contraband of war, by enumerating Its  
  
articles, and the effrct of a real blnckaxle bv  
  
deiloiriij it, In no instance do they aflinn or  
  
implr a right In any soreTeiirn, to endrce  
  
f  
  
on board neutral vessels, on the Wjh leu;  
On the contrary, -whenever a bc!ligercnii  
slalm against liersons on boards neutral vc.  
scl, Is rcfcrml tn In teaticencmics In mUi.  
Ury service alone are excepted from general  
immunity of persons In that situation  
this exception confirm the immunity of those  
who are not included in it.. !j ;i V ......Z.  
It is not then from the law, or the usage of  
nations, nor from the tenor of treaties. tht  
any sanction can be derived from the nrsc,  
tice in question.- .nd surely it will not be.  
pretended that the sovereignty of any riauix.  
extends, in anr esse whatever, hevmul u.  
  
own dominions, and its own vessels on ths  
  
nignscas. oucn a aactrtne would give just  
alarm to all nations and more than any thm­  
would countenance the ImpuuUon of aspirin-to  
an universal empire of the seas. It wi:j  
  
be the less admissiulf too, as it would be ap­  
plicable to times of peace as well as to times V  
of war, and to property as well as to persons.  
If the law of allegiance, which is a mu­  
nicipal la w, be In force at all on the high seas,; &#x27;  
on board foreign vessels, It be so at all times  
  
there, as U is within lu acknowledged sphere, .  
If the reasotw alledtd for it be good in time  
of war namely, that the sovereign hat then  
a right to the service of all his subjects, it  
must be good at all times, because at all times  
he h the same rsht to thtie serrke War  
is not the only occasion for which he mar  
  
want their services : nor is external danrer the  
  
only danger against wldch their serv ices may  
be reqalred for his secretary. Again, if the au­  
thority of a mnaidpal law can operate on per­  
sons ki foreign vessels oa the high seas, because­  
wiihU the dommioQ of their sovereign Uer!  
  
Would be suect to thai law.f aad sre mLa-

regulation, but in every arjf an-1 at esery  
instance wiiere armed vrscU might meet .  
with them. Another inference descrvts at­  
tention. If the subjects of use sovereiga may  
be taken bv force from ts veelsof another,  
on the high seas, the; right of taking them,  
when found, implies the right of searchi,  
for them, a vexation of commerce, evpectaliy  
In time of peace which has not yet been at­  
tempted, and which, for that as well ao-  
ther irasonsy&#x27; mar be regarded ai contrs­  
d&quot;t&#x27;ing the pnncip&#x27;e from w hich it would 6jw.  
Taking reason and juwtke for the tests of  
this practice, it U peculiarly indefrnsse ;  
because it deprives the dearest nrhts of pciv &quot;  
sons, of a regular trial, to which the most  
laconsi!T?,k arocle of prcpertycapt-4m ..  
on the high seas, is rotkkd t and leave their  
destiny to the will cf an ccer, sometimes  
cruel, often Igacrant, and generally fcterrst­  
ed by his want of mariners, in his own deci­  
skm, Ulrtmever preperty found ha a &#x27;&#x27;Dee  
tral vessel U surwwed to be Cable 00 any  
grounds to capture aid condemnation, the  
rule la all cases Is, that the question shah sot  
be decided by the captor, but be carried be­  
fore a legal trfcjunal, where a regular trial  
may be had, and where, the captor himself  
Is I able to damages for an abuse of his power.  
Can it be reasonable then or iust, that a  
bcnigertnt commander who is thus retrc-  
ted and thus rraiomibte in a case of mere  
property, of trivial amount, should be per- &quot;  
mitted, without recurring to any tribunal  
whatever, to examine the crew ct a neutral  
vesstVto decide the Important question of  
their respective alleglancts, and to carrf  
that decision bto h sunt execution by forckc -.  
every Individual he rosy choose, bitoaser  
vice abhorrent to his feelings j cutting him &#x27;  
off from his most tender connexion, exposing: -,  
his mind and his person to the most humiliating &#x27;  
discipline, end his life hsclf to the greatest-t4  
dangers t Reason, justice and humanity enite  
In protesting against so extravagant a pro­  
ceeding. And what is the pretext for it f It  
is that Use similarity cf language and of fea­  
tures, between American cititens, tc British ,  
subject, are such as not easily to be distin­  
guighed and that without this arbitrary sad  
summary authority to make the distinction,  
British subjects woulj escape ttwler-the  
name of American chizens, from the dotr ,  
which they pwe to their sovereign&#x27;. . Is  
then the diificulty of dlstinguiddng a mariner  
of one country from the mariner of the other  
and the immrtance of his services, a good  
plea for referring tlie question whether he  
bclorfs, to one or to the other, to an arbitrary  
decUn on the spot, by an interested and ir­  
responsible officer I la all othercascs, the dif­  
ficulty and the importance of questions are  
considered as reasons for requiring greater&#x27;  
care and formality in investigating them 1.  
greater security for a right decision 00 ibem.  
To say that precautions of this sor are m­  
compatibie with : the object, is to admit that  
the object lutijtstifiUe, slocsthsouly meant,.-,  
by which is can be pursued are, such as can­  
not be justified. r  
t The evil takes a deeper die when viewed  
  
In its practice as well as its principles. Were  
it allowable that BritUh subjects should betakes  
out tifL American vessels online: high  
seas, U might at. least be required that the  
proof of the allegiance should lie cut the Bri-  
&quot;ti side. Tills obvious wiuTp ra.lhfwrr  
erer reversed, and every seamen on board,  
tho going from an American pert and sail- v  
Ing tmifer the American flag, and some times ;

British i&amp;v, and evel as far as Cape IluW

pie in the code of pubU law, is at present  
  
better establisiied, than thecommcn freedom  
  
cf the seas, beyond a vert limited distance from  
  
the territories washed by them. This di  
  
. tance is not indeed Cxcd with abwlute pred-  
  
aion. - It is varied in a small degree by writ  
  
ten autnoriuca and perhaps it may be rea  
  
sonably varied, in some degree, by local pe  
culiarities, But the greatest distance which  
&quot;would now be listened to any where, would  
  
. snake a small proportion of the narrowest  
  
part cf the rarrowestweas in question. rr  
What are in fact the prerogatives claimed

, will ; be one of t. e objections to a formal re­  
linquishment cf it. - &#x27;  
l&quot;his plea, like all the others, admits a so­

if it could prevail at all apaiost Ue neutral  
  
claim, it would authoriM the seizor of the

is not only a preference of a smaller object  
n one skle to a greater object en the other j  
but a sacrifice of right cm one side, -to expe­  
diency on the other sfck. ?::: -r  
Considering, oevertheteu, the possible ad­  
herence ti the British government to this last  
objection, and the extreme importance to our  
sea-taring citizens and commerce, of a stipu­  
lation suppressing a practice flagrant in its naA  
turr, and atiU mora to in tbo abuses insepa­  
rable from it, you are left at liberty to concur,  
if necessary, in the motliftcatitxi as it stands  
in the second column. I You will observe that  
this guards, h all cases, the crews of our  
  
vesacls from being meddled with and in re-  
  
icmng ior an exception to the Immunity on  
board our vessels to the Uw of naliws, y ield  
no principle maintained by the U. States ;  
inasmuch as the reference wdlbe satisfied by  
the acknowledged exception of enemies w  
tniiiury service. Ssould persons therefore,  
other than such, betaken under pretext of  
the law of nations the U, S. will be free to  
coyest the proceeding, aad there is the ks  
diJculty in leaving tlie. stipulation on this  
fjoting,as the case may never happen, and  
wifl be pretty , sure to happen but rarely.  
You wL&#x27;l obwm ahvs, that in the passage  
from one port to another of the respective  
countries, the vessels of the neutral parties  
are to protect all persons without exception.  
Independently of the general principle assert­

her own subjects bound by much stronger ties  
to tlie U. States, as above explained, as well  
as with the Spirit of her commercial law

J j &quot; Although there arc many impor­  
e \ taut objects which may be thought to  
j invite conventional regulations be­  
- i tween the U. S. and G. Britain, it is  
o ! evidently proper to leave for subse­  
quent Consideration, such as arc less  
t &lt; urgent in their nature, or more difri­  
y cult in their adjustment; and thereby  
y to render the way plainer and shorter  
to an agreement with respect lo objects  
which cannot be much longer delayed  
without danger to the good under­  
- standing between the two nations.  
:■ With this view the plan of a (in­  
vention contemplated by the Presi­  
t dent is limited, to the cases of im­  
f j pres-micnls of our seamen, of bloc­  
t I kades, of visiting and searching our  
• {vessels, Of contraband of war, and of  
■ the trade with hosiiie colonies,  
- i with a few other cases, affecting  
- | our maritime rights ; embracing  
- however, as inducements to Great  
Britain to do us justice therein, a pro­  
vision for the surrender of deserting  
seamen and soldiers, and for the pre­  
vention of contraband supplies to her  
&#x27; enemies.&quot;  
On tlie great subject of Lmpress­  
i ments Mr. Madison says, &quot;the coin­  
• manders of British armed vessels  
have, as is well known, been I. ng in  
; this practice. They have indeed not  
. only continued&quot;it] under the sanction  
|of their superiors, on the high seas;  
i but have, with impunity, extended it  
to our own coasts, to neutral ports and  
to neutral territory ; and, in some in  
stances, to our own harbors.

page of the Address, where it is asserted  
that “ Mr King, when minister in England,  
obtained a disavowal of the British govern­  
ment of the right to impress American sea­  
men, naturalized as well as native, on the  
high teas/* But “ at the moment the ar­  
ticles were expected to be signed, an excep­  
tion of the 4 narrow seas&#x27; was urged and  
insisted on by Lord St. Vincents, and being  
utterly inadmissible on out pari, the negoti­  
ation was abandoned.” These circumstan­  
ces arc stated by the pamphleteers to show  
that G. B was willing io enter into a fi icndiy  
arrangement.  
  
To understand the reason why no ar­  
rangement took place, it is necessary to ex  
plain, briefly, what the phrase “ narrow  
*eaa” imports. The pretension to paculi­  
ir rights in those seas is well characterised  
by Mr. Madison, in his letter to Mr. Mon­  
roe of January 5, 1804. “ The objection in  
itself (says Mr. M.) has certainly not the  
slightest foundation. The time has been,  
indeed, when Kngland not only claimed but  
exercised pretensions scarcely inferior to  
tull sovereignty over the seas surrounding  
ihe British Isles, and even as far as Cape  
Finisterre to the south, and Van Staten in  
Norway to the north. It was a time howe­  
ver, when reason had little share in deter­  
mining the law and the intercourse of nati­  
ons; When power alone decided questions  
of right; and when the ignorance and want  
of concert among other maritime countries  
facilitated such an usurpation.” Furthe

1 he commander* of British armed ves­  
se!a have, wwtll known, been long in this  
ptacticc of impressments from American  
I r &#x27;,he h,Kh b”*** » &#x27;toy have in­

’ own coasts, to neutral ports, and to o-tral  
j territory ; and, in some inatancea, to our  
i ”wn harbors. The article does not comnre­  
, bund these latter vases ; because it w udd  
| M,,t l,e verV honorable in Great Britain to  
1 st&#x27;P&#x27;1,a,e aPa»m*t the practice of such • nor­  
j nm,r,’* I&#x27;m* m the. United States to recur to  
3lip;i“ittoiis as a security against it ; and  
bp can sc it inav In* presumed that such parti­  
cular enormities will not be repeated or un­  
punished, after a general stop shall have  
been put to impressments.  
I lie article, in its f.rst firm, renounce#  
the claim to take from the ve-sels of the  
nrmtrsl puny, on the high seas, any person  
whaTrv ;r, nut in the military service of an  
enemy ; in exception which we admit to  
corn- within the law of nations, on the sub­  
jcc.t of eontrabaad »f war.  
Urit &#x27;: thi&#x27;! r rcr/tfinn, (of mdirnrv op—ans  
m the service of the enemy,) we c.o&#x27;.s.der a  
n:*::v.ral nag on the high *eas, as a »if­  
Kuaui tu those sai/it % under it. Gicat Ii;i.  
  
tain, on the contrary, asserts n right to  
sefiich fur, and seize her own subjects.; and  
under that cover, as cannot but happen, are  
often ‘sized and taken off, citizens of the  
United States and citizens or subjects i f &lt;&gt;­  
tiler neutral countries, navigating the high  
&#x27;•as, under the. protection of the &#x27;American  
! &#x27;Us-.  
Were the right of Great Britain in this  
case not denied, the abuses (lowing from it  
wnnid iustiiy the United States in claiming  
and expecting a discontinuance of its ex&lt;*r­  
c lv.it t ic right is denied, aiul on the  
best grounds.  
Although Great Britain has not yet a­  
dopted. in the same latitude with must o­  
tarr nations, the immunities of a neutiv 1  
r.ag, slie Will nut deny the general freedom  
ot the high seas, and of neutral vessels na­  
vigating llieni, with each exce/ition* only,  
ure annexed to it, by the law of nation*.  
She must produce then such an exception  
in the law ot nations, in favor of the riv-ht  
she contends lor. Hut in what written u^ni  
received authority will she find it? In  
what usage, except her own, will it he  
lomid t Site will find in both,that a neutral  
vessel does not protect certain objects de­  
nominated contraband of war, including en*  
emies serving in the war, nor articles going  
into a blockaded port, nor, as she has main­  
tained, and as we have not contested, ene­  
m;.’» property of any kind. But no where  
will she mid an exception to this freedom of  
the seas, and of neutral flags, which justi­  
fies the taking away of any person, not an  
enemy in military service, found on board  
a neutral vessel.  
// erratic*, British as well as others, are  
to he consulted on this subject, it will ctpial­  
&gt;&gt; *ipi&gt;rar, that no countenance to the prac­  
tice can be found in them. Whilst they ad­  
mit a contraband of war, by enumerating  
!,ts art&#x27;c’.es, and the effect of real blockade  
| bv defining it, in no in stance do they affirm  
or imply a right in any sovereign, to enforce  
h:s claims to the allegiance of his subjects,  
on board neutral vessels on the high seas.  
On the contrary, whenever a bcllegerent  
claim against persons on board a neutral  
vessel, is re!erred to in treaties, enemies in  
military service alone are excepted from  
the general immunity of persons in that si­  
tuation ; and this exception confirms the  
immunity ot those who are not included in  
It  
  
- is not then from the law, or the iisat&#x27;e  
ot nations, nor from the tenor of treaties,  
t-at ny sanction can be derived for the  
practice in question. And surely it will not  
l.o pretended that »he sovereignty of any na­  
iou extends, in any case whatever, beyond  
str. own dominions, and its own vessels on  
the hjgh seas. Such a doctrine would give  
,ust aht’ni to all nations, and more than  
:ti y thing would countenance the imputati  
on of aspiring to an universal empire of the  
&#x27; c&#x27;“s; &quot;ou.d be the less admissible too,  
as it would he applicable to times of  
peace as well as to times of war, and tc  
property as well as to persons. If the law  
\oJ allegiance, which is a muniii/ial law, be  
in force at all on the high seas, on board for­  
sign vessels, it must be so at all times there,  
as it-is within its acknowledged sphere. If  
the leuson alledged for it be good in time  
ot war, namely, that the sovereign has then  
a light .0 the service of all his subjects, it  
oust be gi.o.l at all timer, because at all  
times he has the same right to their ser­  
vice. , War is not the only occasion for  
which he may want their services; nor is  
external danger the only danger ag.iinst  
which her services may be required for his  
security. Again, if the authority of a mu­  
nicipal law can operate on persons in for­  
! eign vessels on the high seas, because with­  
in the dominion ol their sovereign they would  
j be subject to that law and are violating that  
law by being in that situation; how reject  
the inference that the authority of a muni­  
pal law n.ay equally be enforced on lizard  
torcign vessels on the high seas, against ar­  
ticles of property exported in violation of  
such a aw, or belonging to the country from  
| winch it was exported ?  
I. A,K* every commercial rornlation  
I in time of peace too. as well as &quot;of war|  
i made obligatory on foreigners and  
j ,cn.’ ve!jsels, not only whilst within the  
| dominion ot the sovereign making the re­  
gulation, but in every sea, and at every  
distance where an armed vessel might meet  
u ,th them. • Another inference deserv«s  
attention. I&gt; the subjects of one sovereign  
may be taken by force from the vessels &quot;of  
another, on the high seas, the right of ta­  
king them when found, implies - the right of  
seat clung for them, a vexation of commerce,  
especially in time of peace, which lias  
not yet been attempted, and which for that  
as well as other reasons, may be regarded  
as contradicting the principle, from which  
it would How.  
  
■.*». ..■ “,,u justice i or tne tests ot  
this practice,it is peculiarly indefensil- Ic ; be­  
cause it depriv es the (learett right/if,f persons  
of a regular trial to. which the most inconsi­  
aerau.e article of property captured on the  
higa seas, is entitled; and leaves their res  
tiny to the will of an officer, sometimes  
cruel, often ignorant, and generally inter­  
ested by his want of mariners, in his own  
decisions. - Whenever property found in a  
neutral vessel, is supposed to be liable, on  
any grounds to capture and condemnation,  
the rule hi all cases is that the Question  
shAi. not be decided by the captor, but be  
carried before a legal tribunal, where a re*  
ginar trial itfty be had, and where, the cap  
tor himself is 1:ible. to damages, for an a­  
buje ot power. Can it fie reasonable then,  
orjr.t,. lhat u belligerent commander, who  
is thus 11 yjrioted, and tlius responsible in a  
case ot mere property of trivial amount,  
should tie permitted, without recurring to  
any tribunal whatever, toexamine the crew  
ot a neutral vessel, to decide Pie important  
question of tlietr respective allegiances, and  
to cany that decision into instant executi­  
on, |&gt;y forcing every individual he may  
chr.se, r.it* a service abhorrent to his feel­  
ing. cutting him off from his most tender  
r.omi-ctiiMis, exposing his mind ami bis per-&#x27;  
son to the nmst humiliating disciplife, anti  
his life itself to the greatest dangers ? Kt-a­  
son. justice and humanity, unite in protest  
mgagniiiM *ai rx*rav»gant a proceeding._  
And what is the pretert lor \\ * It is that  
flic similarity of language and of features  
between American citizen.&quot;. and British sub­  
fee&#x27;s are such os not .easily to be &lt;li*tm­  
i^oished ; ami that without this Arbitrary and  
sniniuary authority to make the distinct ion,  
Hntish subjects would escape, under the  
name of American citizens, from the- duty  
which thev owe to their sovereign. Is then  
, the difficulty of distinguishing a m inner  
\ &#x27; • i,ur country from the mariner of the o­  
|t&gt;er, and &#x27;.In importance of his services, h  
p1 ^ plea f »r referring the question w hether  
lie belongs to tliu one or to the othtt, to an  
hi bin ary decision on the spot, by 211 interest  
r 1 -„J ..... L-poojMoic wiiic.fl&#x27; * In other  
  
cases, the difficulty and tne importance of  
questions are considered as reasons for re­  
qniring greater care and formality in in­  
yestimating them, and greater security for  
a right decision on them. To say that pre­  
cauti &gt;ns of this sort are incompatible with  
the object is m admit that the object is un­  
justifiable ; since the only means by which  
it can be pursued are such as cannot be jus­  
tified. .  
i ue evil takes a deeper die, when view­  
ed in its /iractice as well as its fitincif./e.-.  
Were it allowable that British subjects  
should be taken out of American vcsstls on  
l ie high seas, it might at least be required  
that the proof of their allegiance should lie  
on the British Side. 1 his obvious and just  
rule is, however, reversed; and every sea­  
man on board, though gom;; from an Ame­  
rica a port, and sailing under tl o American  
‘•ag, and sometimes even speaking an idiom  
proving him not to be a British subject, is  
presumed to be such, unless shewn to be  
on American citiz(n. It may safely lie af­  
firmed that this is an Outrage and .m indig­  
nity which has no precedent, and which ti.  
Britain would be mining ihe last nations in  
the world to stiller, if &quot;offered to her own  
subjects, and her own flag- H  
always against the ri;&gt;ht piesumption a­  
•one, which is in favor of the citizenship  
corresponding with the Hag, that the  
y iolenco is committed. ■ ^ot unfrequent­  
lv it takes place in defiance of the most  
positive proof, certified in due form bv  
rm American officer. I.et it not he said,  
that in granting to American seamen this  
protection for their rights as such, the point  
is yielded, that the proof lies on the Ameri­  
can side, and that the want of it in the  
pi escribed form justifies the inference that  
the seaman is not cf American allegiance._  
It is.distinctly lo be understood, that the j  
cei tificate usually called a protection to A­  
merican seamen, is not meant to protect  
them under their own, cr even unu other  
neutral Jlug on the high seas.  
We can never admit, that in such a  
situation, any other protection is required  
for them, than the netitruljlag itself on the  
high seas. The document is given to prove  
their real character, in situations to which  
neithet the law of nations, nor the law of  
thcii own country, are applicable ; in other  
yyords, to protect them, within the jurisdic­  
tion ot the British luyvs, and to secure to  
them, within every other jurisdiction, the  
rights and immunities due to them. If, in  
the course of their navigation even on the  
high seas, the document should have the  
effect of repelling wrongs of any sort, it is  
afi incidental advantage only, of which they  
avail themselves, and is bv no means to be  
misconstrued into a right to exact such a  
proof, or to make any disadvantageous in- J  
ference from the yvant of it.  
  
v\ ere It even aumit ed. that certificates f &gt;r  
protection might be justly required in time  
ot war, from American seamen, they c&#x27; dd  
only be required in cases where the lapse of  
time from its commencement, had given an  
opportunity for the American seamen to  
provide themselves with such a document.—  
Yet it is certain, that in a variety of in­  
stances, seamen have been impressed from  
American vessel*, on the plea that they  
hud not this proof of citizenship, when the  
dates and places of the impressments de­  
monstrated the impossibility of their know­  
ti.ij in time to provide the proof, that a state  
of war had rendered it necessary.  
Whether, therefore, we consult the law  
of nations, the tenor of treaties, or the dic­  
tates ot reason and justice, no warrant no  
f retext can be found for the British hr*c­  
tice of making impressments from American  
vessels on the high seas.  
Is not this Conclusive ?

ry of State, and none of the varied productions of his  
pen are more masterly than those in which he exposed  
the tyranny of this pretension. In the course of this  
discussion he showed the special hardship found in the  
fact that the sailors were taken from the ship at the  
more wll of an oficer, without any form of padleind pene  
and thus early presented against the pretension  
of Great Britain the precise objection which is now  
adopted by her. Here are his emphatic words, in his  
celebrated instructions to Mr. Monroe, at that time our  
Minister at London, dated January 5, 1804.  
Taking reason and justice for the tests of this practice, it  
is peculiarly indefenstble, because if deprives the deurest rights of  
persons of a reqilar trial, to which the most inconsiderable  
Article of property captured on the high scas is entitled, and  
loares the destiny to the will of an officer, sometimes cruel  
often ignorant, and senerally interested, by want of manie  
in hes own decisions. Whenever property found in a  
neutral vessel is supposed to be liable, on any ground, to  
capture and condemnation, the rule in all cases is, that the  
question shall not be decided by the captor, but be carried  
lefore a legal tribunal, where a regular trial may be had, and  
where the captor himse f is Iable to damages for an  
abuse of his power. Can it be reasonable, then, or  
Juat, that a beilligerent commander who is thusree  
icted, and thus responable in a case of mere pro  
tof trisial amount, should be permitied eithout repug  
to any trthunal whatever, to cxamine the cret of a neutral

of State, and  
none of the varied productions of his pen are more  
masterly than those in which he exposed the tyr-  
anny of this pretension. In the course of this  
discussion he showed the special hardship found  
in the fact that the sailors were taken from the  
ship at the mere will of an officer, without any  
form of judicial proceedings, and thus early pre-  
  
| sented against the pretension of Great Britain the  
  
  
  
precise objection which is now adopted by her.  
Here are his emphatic words, in his celebrated  
instructions to Mr. Monroe, at that time our min-  
ister at London, dated January 5, 1804:  
  
“ Taking reason and justice for the tests of this practice,  
it is peculiarly indefensible, because it deprives the dearest  
vights of persons of aregular trial, to which the most incon  
siderable article of property captured on the high seas is  
entitled, and leaves the destiny to the will of an officer,  
sometimes cruel, often ignorant, and generally interested,  
by want of mariners, in his own decisions. Whenever  
property found in a neutral vessel is supposed to be liable,  
on any ground, to capture and condemuation, the rule in  
all cases is, that the question shall not be decided by the  
captor, but be carried before a Jegal tribunal, where a reg  
ular trial may be had, and where the captor himself is liable  
to damages for an abuse of his power. Can it be reason-  
able, then, or just, that a belligerent commander who ts  
thus restricted, and thus responsible in a case of mere prop-  
erty of trivial amount. should be permitted, without recur-  
ring to any tribunal whatever, to examine the crew of aneu  
tral vessel, to decide the important question of their respective  
allegiances, and to carry that decision into execution by  
forcing every individual he may choose into a service ab-  
horrent to his feelings, cutting him off from his most tender  
cohnections, exposing his mind and his person to the most  
humiliating discipline, and his life itself to the greatest  
danger? Reason, justice, and humanity unite in protest-  
ing against so extravagant a proceeding.”-—State Papers,

Then again, in the same dispatch, Mr. Madison  
says:  
  
** Great Britain, then, must produce an exception in the  
law of nations in favor of the right she contends for. In  
what written and received authority will she find it? In  
what usage, except her own, will it be found ?” : .  
. . ** But nowhere will she find an exception to this  
freedom of the seas and of neutral flags, which justifies the  
taking away of any person, not an enemy in military ser  
vice, found on board a neutral vessel.’’—TIbid., p. 84.  
  
And then, again, in the same dispatch, he says:  
  
** Whenever a belligerent claim against persons on board  
a neutral vessel is referred to in treaties, enemies in mili  
tary service alone are excepted from the general immunity  
of persons in that situation ; and this exception confirms the  
immunity of those who are not included in it.’’—Ibid., p. 84.

&quot;She will not deny the general freedom of the  
high seas, and of neutral vessels navigating them,  
with such exceptions only as are annexed to it by  
the law of nations.S Bul nowhere will she  
find an erception to this freedom of the seas, and of  
nentral flags, which justifies the taking awny of any  
persom not an enemy in military sercice, found oh  
board a neutral vessel. If treaties, Brit sh as well  
as others, are to be consulted on this subject,  
it will equally appear that no countenance to the  
practice can be found in them. Whilst they admit  
a contraband of war, by enumerating its articles,  
and the effect of a real blockade by defining it, in  
no instance do they affirm or imply a right in any  
sovereign to enforce his claims to the allegiance of  
his subjects on board nentral reesets on the h  
seas, on the contrary, whenever a belligerent claim  
against persons on board a neutral vessel is reierred  
to in treaties, enemies in mititary sereice alone are  
excepted from the general immunity of persons in  
that situation; and this exception confiras the im­  
munity of those who are not included in it.  
If the law of allegiance, which is a municipal law,  
be in force at all on the high seas on board foreign  
vessels, it must be so at all ti nes there, as it is wih­  
in its acknowledged sphere. If the reason alleged  
for it be good in time of war, namely, that the sove­  
reign has then a right to the service of all his sub-  
jects, it must he good at all times, because he has the  
same right to their service.  Taking rea­  
son and justice for the tests of this practice, it is  
peculiarly indefensible, because it deprives the dear­  
est rights of persons of a regular trial, to which the  
most inconsiderable article of property captured on  
the high seas is entitled, and leaves thir destiny to  
the will of an officer.&quot; Am. State Papers. Vol
