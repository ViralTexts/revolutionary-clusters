nounce tne fatal event -f which your let­  
j ter of October the 20th h u given me omi­  
nous foreboding. Trod m&gt;«e|f in xhe

form of connection which can rive the hu- I  
man heart, 1 know well, and feel  
you have lost, what you are suffering, I

have taught me that for ills so immeasur­  
able, time and silence are the only medi­  
cine. I will not, therefore, by useless  
condolence, open afresh the sluices of  
your grief, nor, mingling sincerely my  
tears with yours, will I say a word where  
words are vain; but it is of some comfort  
to us both, that the time is not very dis­  
tant, at which we are to di posit in the  
same cerement our sorrows and suffning  
bodies, and to ascend in essence to an ec­  
static meeting with the friends we have

love and never lose again.  
God bless you, and support you under  
your heavy affliction.
