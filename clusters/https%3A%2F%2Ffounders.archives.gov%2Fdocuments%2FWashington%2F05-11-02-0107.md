As Mrs Washington and myself expect to set out to morrow for Philadelpa and the Majr &amp; Fanny the day after if the Vessel which is to carry him to Colo. Bassets arrives in time, I have taken the advantage of the good opportunity afforded by Mr Robt Lewis of sending Harriot to Fredericksburg. It is done at this time (notwithstanding your proposed visit to Albemarle) 1st because it would be improper to leave her here after we are all gone; 2d because there would be no person to accompany her down afterwards; and 3d because it might be inconvenient for her to travel alone.  
She comes—as Mrs Washington informs me—very well provided with every thing proper for a girl in her situation: this much I know, that she costs me enough to place her in it. I do not, however, want you (or any one else) to do more by her than merely to admit her into your family whilst this House is uninhabited by a female white Woman, and thereby rendered an unfit place for her to remain at—I shall continue to do for her what I have already done for Seven years past &amp; that is to furnish her with such reasonable &amp; proper necessaries as she may stand in need of, notwithstanding I have had both her brothers upon my hands and been obliged to pay several hundred pounds out of my own Pocket for the board, Schooling &amp; Cloathing &amp;ca of them for more than the period above mentioned; their fathers Estate being unable to discharge the Executions as fast as they issued against it.  
Harriot has sense enough, but no disposition to industry nor to be careful of her Cloaths. Your example and admonition may,  
  
with proper restraints, overcome the two last—and to that end I wish you would examine her Cloaths and direct her in the use and application of them—for without this they will be (I am told) dabbed about in every hole &amp; corner—&amp; her best things always in use. Fanny was too easy, too much of her own indolent turn, and had too little authority to cause, either by precept or example, any change in this for the better &amp; Mrs Washington[’s] absence has been injurious to her in many respects—but she is young and with good advice, may yet make a fine woman.  
If, notwithstanding the supposition that she is well provided with every thing (except a Cloak which was not to be had in Alexandria and may be got at Fredericksburg) a deficiency is found, &amp; you will supply it, there need be no occasion for your laying in advance more than ten days, as I could at any time remit a bank note (in a letter) to you in four days after I was made acquainted with the amount. I do not mean by this to launch into expensiveness—She has no pretensions to it, nor would the state of my finances enable me to endulge her in them if she had.

My Dear Sister  
  
As MS Washington and myself expect to set out tomorrow for Philadelp* I have  
taken advantage of the good opportunity afforded by M‘ Rob‘ Lewis of sending  
Harriet to Fredericksburg.—It is done at this time (notwithstanding your proposed  
  
visit to Albermarle) 1* because it would be improper to leave her here after we are  
all gone ; 2&quot;&#x27;—because there would be no person to accompany her down after-  
wards ;—and 3™ because it might be inconvenient for her to travel alone.—  
  
She comes—as M* Washington informs me—very well provided with everything  
proper for a girl in her situation :—this much I know that she costs me enough.—  
I do not however want you (or anyone else) to do more by her than merely to ad-  
mit her into your family whilst this House is uninhabited by a female white woman,  
and thereby rendered an unfit place for her to remain at. I shall continue to do  
for her what I have already done for seven years past, and that is to furnish her  
with such reasonable and proper necessaries as she may stand in need of, notwith-  
standing I have had both her brothers upon my hands and I have been obliged to  
pay several hundred pounds out of my own pocket for their board, schooling, and  
cloathing, &amp;c, for more than the period aforementioned : their father’s estate being  
unable to discharge the executions as fast as they are issued against it.  
  
Harriet has sense enough but no disposition to industry, nor to be careful of her  
cloathes. Your example and admonition may with proper restraints overcome the  
two last and to that end I wish you would examine her cloathes, and direct her in  
the use and application of them—for without this they will be (I am told) dabbed  
about, in every hole and corner, and her best things always in use. Fanny was too  
easy, too much of her own indolent turn, and had too little authority to cause  
either by precept or example any change in this for the better, and M* Washing-

ton’s absence has been injurious to her in many respects—but she is young and  
with good advice, may yet make a fine woman. If notwithstanding the suggestion  
that she is well provided with everything (except a cloak which may not to be had  
in Alexandria and may be got at Fredericksburg, a deficiency is found and you  
wish to supply it, there will be no occasion for your laying in advance more than  
ten days as I could at any time remit a bank note ina letter in four days after I  
was made acquainted with the amount. I do not mean by this to launch into  
expensiveness—she has no pretensions to it, nor would the state of my finances
