Very unwell with a sore throat, so that I did not attend meeting. Dined with White at my chamber. We had in the evening a meeting of the A B. I read the following piece.

Without a sign, his sword the brave man draws  
And asks no omen, but his country’s cause.  
  
Superstition is a quality, which in all ages of the world, has had peculiar sway, over the human mind: it seems to have been implanted there by the hand of Nature: when two uncommon events happen in the same place, and in a short space of Time, the ignorant vulgar will immediately conclude, the one to be the effect of the other: Imagination usurps the place of Reas

Polydamus endeavours to dissuade  
him from attacking the Grecian en-  
trenchments, and predicts, from the  
omen, that the Gods were unfavour-

spurning such tame, effeminate, and

Ye vagrants of the sky, your wings extend  
  
Or where the suns arise, or where extend ;

While I the dictates of high heaven obey.

The honor of the country vindicated, Mr. Clay  
was called to take part in the negotiations at  
Ghent, which led to the treaty of peace. It is  
matter of history that to him we are indebted for  
depriving Great Britain of the free navigation of  
the Mississippi,-a pretension very effectually dis­  
posed of shortly after the signing of the treaty,  
but before its arrival in this country by the bril­

 is  
accuracy ; that care in the selection of corresponding idioms, in  
the adoption of equivalent epithets, in the similar distribution  
of the matter, is not labor thrown away. A few critics, it is  
true, continue to advocate the old theory and practice, accord-  
ing to which a very loose paraphrase is allowed to assume the  
name of a translation, however unfaithful it may be to the form,  
and even the spirit, of the original. Thus a recent writer in
